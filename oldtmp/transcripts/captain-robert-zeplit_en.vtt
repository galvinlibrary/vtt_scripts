David Boder: [In English] November the 2nd, 1949. A duplication for the United States Public Health Service. Spool 9-139B, the second part of spool 139 which we have called now 139A. Captain Zeplit study starts. At the beginning there are a few sentences spoken in Russian by a woman who apparently stepped into the interview room and we had to demonstrate the machine to her.

00:01:15.555 --> 00:01:53.856
David Boder: Munich Germany, September the 21st 1946, in the Lohengrin camp occupied predominantly by [free?] Baltian gender population: Latvians, Estonians and Lithuanians. The interviewee is Mr. Robert Zeplit, a seaman who spent a long time in English speaking countries and therefore we are having the rare opportunity of to have an interview in English. Also, [giving Zeplit instructions]...will you turn around here. And talk in this direction in general. You don’t have to directly...

00:01:53.856 --> 00:01:58.922
David Boder: Will you tell us again what is your name, how old are you and where were you born.

00:01:58.922 --> 00:02:07.618
Robert Zeplit: My name is Robert Zeplit. I was born in Latvia 1890 in January.

00:02:07.618 --> 00:02:12.467
David Boder: In January 1890. So you are now about fifty-six years old?

00:02:12.467 --> 00:02:13.748
Robert Zeplit: That’s right sir.

00:02:13.748 --> 00:02:15.991
David Boder: All right, what is your occupation Mr. Zeplit?

00:02:15.991 --> 00:02:17.241
Robert Zeplit: I am ship’s captain.

00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:20.229
David Boder: You are a ship’s captain? Are you a licensed ship’s captain?

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.952
Robert Zeplit: Yes, sir.

00:02:20.952 --> 00:02:26.836
David Boder: What kind of ships did you...lead? What kind of ships did you travel?

00:02:26.836 --> 00:02:37.529
Robert Zeplit: I carried two captain’s licenses, a Russian license and from 1912...a Latvian captain’s license.

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:39.617
David Boder: A Latvian? From 1912?

00:02:39.617 --> 00:02:40.557
Robert Zeplit: 1912.

00:02:40.557 --> 00:02:42.273
David Boder: Were there already Latvian captains...?

00:02:42.273 --> 00:02:46.191
Robert Zeplit: No. There are times when the Latvian’s was Russian citizens...

00:02:46.191 --> 00:02:47.379
David Boder: Yes

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.359
Robert Zeplit: . . . and I finished the navigation school in 1912...

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:52.423
David Boder: Where did you finish navigation school?

00:02:52.423 --> 00:02:53.208
Robert Zeplit: Riga.

00:02:53.208 --> 00:02:53.807
David Boder: Where?

00:02:53.807 --> 00:02:54.468
Robert Zeplit: In Riga.

00:02:54.468 --> 00:02:54.788
David Boder: Riga! [emphasis for pronunciation]

00:02:54.788 --> 00:02:55.201
Robert Zeplit: Riga.

00:02:55.201 --> 00:03:00.360
David Boder: Where you finished your navigation school in Riga and then got the captain certificate.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.207
Robert Zeplit: Yes.

00:03:01.207 --> 00:03:04.784
David Boder: All right let’s see...

00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:19.004
David Boder: Now, will you tell me now, Captain Zeplit, where were you when the war started and what happened to you since then?

00:03:19.004 --> 00:03:33.192
Robert Zeplit: I was in the United States till...1939, July month. I came back to Latvia to get my legal papers for entry in United States to become United States citizen.

00:03:33.192 --> 00:03:35.807
David Boder: What for were you in the United States—what were you doing here?

00:03:35.807 --> 00:03:41.649
Robert Zeplit: Well, I was working on ships as quartermaster [?], as boats-man and various other jobs.

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:43.996
David Boder: What kind of ships were you working on?

00:03:43.996 --> 00:03:53.547
Robert Zeplit: City-service [unintelligible]...Sanitary Company [?], Gulf [intellible] Company and...Texas Company.

00:03:53.547 --> 00:03:55.834
David Boder: And where were the ship going?

00:03:55.834 --> 00:03:59.571
Robert Zeplit: From New York/Boston from north to south Texas

00:03:59.571 --> 00:04:02.583
David Boder: Aha, they were running along the American shore.

00:04:02.583 --> 00:04:03.662
Robert Zeplit: American shore, that’s right.

00:04:03.662 --> 00:04:07.127
David Boder: And why did you have to go back to Latvia to get your papers?

00:04:07.127 --> 00:04:25.759
Robert Zeplit: Well I took my first papers in Jackson in Florida, 1923 but after three years I sign as second mate on a [Norwegian?] ship and that was the reason I lose my rights...my right to become a citizen.

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:29.647
David Boder: To become a citizen. And so you had to go back and start anew.

00:04:29.647 --> 00:04:30.816
Robert Zeplit: Start from the new.

00:04:30.816 --> 00:04:36.879
David Boder: All right, so you came in 1939 to Latvia. What was Latvia then?

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:41.251
Robert Zeplit: Latvia was independent country with its own president.

00:04:41.251 --> 00:04:43.085
David Boder: The president was Ulmanis.

00:04:43.085 --> 00:04:43.922
Robert Zeplit: Was Ulmanis.

00:04:43.922 --> 00:04:46.602
David Boder: But there was no parliament in Latvia

00:04:46.602 --> 00:04:48.678
Robert Zeplit: No, there was parliament.

00:04:48.678 --> 00:04:51.992
David Boder: Well, didn’t Ulmanis dismiss the parliament?

00:04:51.992 --> 00:05:09.597
Robert Zeplit: Well, uh...I don’t know because I was so many years away I don’t know exactly how the Parliament was changing in Latvia but Ulmanis was the President and so far as I know there was...there was Parliament too. Parliament too...

00:05:09.597 --> 00:05:12.247
David Boder: Wasn’t Ulmanis just a dictator like any other dictator?

00:05:12.247 --> 00:05:30.184
Robert Zeplit: No, he wasn’t [bad?] dictator. But he took all the...businesses in his own hands and to...do all the...

00:05:30.184 --> 00:05:31.414
David Boder: The administration himself.

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:35.483
Robert Zeplit: . . . administration by himself together with advisors.

00:05:35.483 --> 00:05:55.375
David Boder: Uh huh.

00:05:55.375 --> 00:06:07.547
David Boder: [Break in the wire] We had here a break in the wire. I am interviewing Captain Robert Zeplit and we are practically at the beginning of his story.

00:06:07.547 --> 00:06:20.287
David Boder: Also, Captain Zeplit, you were telling me that you lost the...[value?] of your first - the first of your first papers - and so you had to go back to Latvia and start anew getting your Visa to the States.

00:06:20.287 --> 00:06:20.671
Robert Zeplit: That’s right.

00:06:20.671 --> 00:06:22.052
David Boder: In what year was that?

00:06:22.052 --> 00:06:23.584
Robert Zeplit: 1939.

00:06:23.584 --> 00:06:26.898
David Boder: All right, now go ahead. And what happened then?

00:06:26.898 --> 00:06:39.548
Robert Zeplit: Well, I came to Latvia in 1939 just month and a half before the war broke out between Germany and Poland. I never heard since...they never...not let me out from Latvia.

00:06:39.548 --> 00:06:41.352
David Boder: They don’t—didn’t let you go from Latvia?

00:06:41.352 --> 00:06:42.008
Robert Zeplit: No.

00:06:42.008 --> 00:06:42.784
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:42.784 --> 00:06:49.210
Robert Zeplit: And I was in Latvia until the day the Bolshevikii came...

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:50.560
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.481
Robert Zeplit: . . . until the last day when the Germans pushed me out.

00:06:53.481 --> 00:07:03.960
David Boder: Uh-huh, well, tell me now how did the Russians (or the Soviets or the Bolsheviks what you call them) how did they come into Latvia? What happened then?

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:46.879
Robert Zeplit: Well, they...so much I know they come friendly the first days but after they start acting against the Latvian people—very [harshly?]. In nineteen-the last what I see with my own eyes- in 1941, 14 June they was picking people during the nighttime took out from living quarters and loaded in trucks and sent to railroad station. And they was loaded in railroad stations for transportation in Russia.

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:48.411
David Boder: What for?

00:07:48.411 --> 00:07:54.226
Robert Zeplit: Well, to guess, I don’t know.

00:07:54.226 --> 00:07:58.537
David Boder: Did some of these people come back?

00:07:58.537 --> 00:08:00.461
Robert Zeplit: Not so far I know, I don’t know.

00:08:00.461 --> 00:08:04.984
David Boder: You don’t know. And those were Latvians that they were loading in trucks.

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:15.186
Robert Zeplit: Latvians and uh...not all Latvians but there was uh...all the Latvian citizens there was...all the nation was what was in Latvia.

00:08:15.186 --> 00:08:18.833
David Boder: . . . that were in Latvia. Well did they take rich people, did they take...

00:08:18.833 --> 00:08:19.338
Robert Zeplit: No.

00:08:19.338 --> 00:08:20.477
David Boder: . . . poor people, what kind of people did they take...?

00:08:20.477 --> 00:08:40.964
Robert Zeplit: That was surprise me because I heard that the Russians they were against the rich people but that time they was picking over the working class—working class too—most of them. They were sent out from Latvia, 36,000 and I guess from this 36,000 there was most working class.

00:08:40.964 --> 00:09:00.399
David Boder: Yes - there can’t be 36,000 rich people in a small country like Latvia. Now tell me this...did they mistreat the people? Did they shoot any people? Did they...what did they do otherwise?

00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:04.529
Robert Zeplit: They...some of them was shot in Latvia.

00:09:04.529 --> 00:09:06.091
David Boder: Who were they?

00:09:06.091 --> 00:09:13.997
Robert Zeplit: Nu. Who was in the police duty and one other...politiken...

00:09:13.997 --> 00:09:15.317
David Boder: Yes.

00:09:15.317 --> 00:09:16.486
Robert Zeplit: . . . and...

00:09:16.486 --> 00:09:19.136
David Boder: What happened to Ulmanis?

00:09:19.136 --> 00:09:42.175
Robert Zeplit: Well Ulmanis was...for a long time he was in his castle and the Russians kept guards and never let nobody go to him. After he was sent to Russia the last, what uh...I know he was in Crimea

00:09:42.175 --> 00:09:54.005
David Boder: In Crimea. Now tell me this...there were Germans in Latvia weren’t there? All kind of, all the barons and so on what happened to them?

00:09:54.005 --> 00:10:00.410
Robert Zeplit: Well some of them were sent out and some not.

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:05.658
David Boder: Now tell me and then what? Latvia became a Soviet country?

00:10:05.658 --> 00:10:11.238
Robert Zeplit: Well there was voting...to join the Soviet Union.

00:10:11.238 --> 00:10:16.914
Robert Zeplit: But the voting was forced on the Latvian people.

00:10:16.914 --> 00:10:23.431
David Boder: Now tell me this—weren’t there many Latvians that were Communists?

00:10:23.431 --> 00:10:26.685
Robert Zeplit: Not many.

00:10:26.685 --> 00:10:31.903
David Boder: Did there any Latvians come from Russia with the Soviets?

00:10:31.903 --> 00:10:33.344
Robert Zeplit: Yes, many of them.

00:10:33.344 --> 00:10:35.299
David Boder: Who were communists in Russia?

00:10:35.299 --> 00:10:36.166
Robert Zeplit: Yeah.

00:10:36.166 --> 00:10:49.390
David Boder: Uh huh. Tell me then, how long did it last? How long did the Bolsheviks run the country? What did they do? Did they...? How did people work or son on? They didn’t take you?

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:51.586
Robert Zeplit: No, my story is long.

00:10:51.586 --> 00:10:54.387
David Boder: Well tell your story, we have time.

00:10:54.387 --> 00:11:15.576
Robert Zeplit: When the Bolshevikii came here in Latvia, everyone was [write?] what he did and what education. Well sir, [what I brought showed?] I was in the United States for so many years and I had such and such education.

00:11:15.576 --> 00:11:16.564
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:16.564 --> 00:11:18.821
Robert Zeplit: They never let me have a job.

00:11:18.821 --> 00:11:19.930
David Boder: Why?

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:27.262
Robert Zeplit: Well I don’t know because they was afraid, the Russians was afraid of people who see the...world.

00:11:27.262 --> 00:11:28.915
David Boder: See what?

00:11:28.915 --> 00:11:35.646
Robert Zeplit: See the world...nu. Who was in other countries.

00:11:35.646 --> 00:11:38.719
David Boder: Oh, who have seen other countries who have seen the world

00:11:38.719 --> 00:11:45.810
Robert Zeplit: Yes. So I get a job on a little tug boat as a captain...

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.281
David Boder: From the Russians?

00:11:47.281 --> 00:11:51.471
Robert Zeplit: Latvians. [Worked well?] because the managers was Russians.

00:11:51.471 --> 00:11:52.429
David Boder: Yes

00:11:52.429 --> 00:11:59.013
Robert Zeplit: But I was suspect and somebody was always looking after me.

00:11:59.013 --> 00:12:02.632
David Boder: Now so you got a job on a tug boat and what happened then?

00:12:02.632 --> 00:12:27.946
Robert Zeplit: Well I’d been working on the tugboat till the day the Germans enter—the Germans came (the 4th of July, 1941). But...1941, 28 June, I get orders from the Russians, not me alone but all the ships captain’s, go with ships to Russia.

00:12:27.946 --> 00:12:29.236
David Boder: Where to?

00:12:29.236 --> 00:12:30.496
Robert Zeplit: To Pärnu.

00:12:30.496 --> 00:12:32.511
David Boder: Oh. Pärnu was Russia or Estonia?

00:12:32.511 --> 00:12:33.680
Robert Zeplit: No, Estonia

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.366
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:34.366 --> 00:12:38.979
Robert Zeplit: But we received the orders for us to go to Pärnu.

00:12:38.979 --> 00:12:41.508
David Boder: What was the Russian name for Pärnu?

00:12:41.508 --> 00:12:42.617
Robert Zeplit: Pärnu.

00:12:42.617 --> 00:12:46.112
David Boder: And so? What did you do?

00:12:46.112 --> 00:12:55.076
Robert Zeplit: Well I went with my ship on the sea together with other ships. At nighttime—half past one—I run on shore.

00:12:55.076 --> 00:12:55.973
Robert Zeplit: The ship...

00:12:55.973 --> 00:12:57.052
David Boder: On purpose?

00:12:57.052 --> 00:13:10.915
Robert Zeplit: Yes. And I was eight days in the woods. I hide myself because I know when they gonna catch me I know what is going to happen with me.

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:13.988
David Boder: Yes, and the rest of the people on the ship?

00:13:13.988 --> 00:13:15.157
Robert Zeplit: Saved...

00:13:15.157 --> 00:13:16.840
David Boder: They run away with you.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.396
Robert Zeplit: Run away with me. But I wasn’t together with them; I was alone.

00:13:20.396 --> 00:13:22.834
David Boder: Were they all Latvians?

00:13:22.834 --> 00:13:23.792
Robert Zeplit: All Latvians.

00:13:23.792 --> 00:13:30.850
David Boder: Yes. Nu. So you went eight days in the woods in Estonia. Then what happened?

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:33.077
Robert Zeplit: Then came the Germans

00:13:33.077 --> 00:13:34.518
David Boder: That quick?

00:13:34.518 --> 00:13:38.074
Robert Zeplit: Well that was...fourth...yeah.

00:13:38.074 --> 00:13:38.971
David Boder: Oh, uh...

00:13:38.971 --> 00:13:43.282
Robert Zeplit: 1st...July...Germans came to Riga.

00:13:43.282 --> 00:13:49.738
David Boder: That means you have told to go with the ships to Russia when the Russians and Germans already started fighting.

00:13:49.738 --> 00:13:50.998
Robert Zeplit: Started...[unintelligible; talking over each other]...

00:13:50.998 --> 00:13:56.986
David Boder: All right, so then...you...and in eight days came the Germans. Then what happened?

00:13:56.986 --> 00:13:58.548
Robert Zeplit: Well, I came back to Riga.

00:13:58.548 --> 00:13:59.829
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:59.829 --> 00:14:04.533
Robert Zeplit: In Riga I get job again on the riverboat as captain.

00:14:04.533 --> 00:14:06.065
David Boder: From the Germans now?

00:14:06.065 --> 00:14:08.020
Robert Zeplit: No they was Latvians.

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:14.597
David Boder: They were Latvians...for the start. Tell me what did the Germans do when they came to Latvia?

00:14:14.597 --> 00:14:21.990
Robert Zeplit: Well, we expect it will be better but after they start out the same as the Russians did.

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:23.914
David Boder: What did they do?

00:14:23.914 --> 00:14:34.116
Robert Zeplit: Well they force us to do such work we dislike and we never had free hands to pick out the job what kind of we want

00:14:34.116 --> 00:14:38.699
David Boder: Yes. What did the Germans do with the Jews in that place?

00:14:38.699 --> 00:14:43.675
Robert Zeplit: Well, they did the same what they did here in Germany.

00:14:43.675 --> 00:14:45.237
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:45.237 --> 00:14:55.832
Robert Zeplit: They arrested them, sent to concentration camps. And telling the truth, there was many shot.

00:14:55.832 --> 00:15:00.204
David Boder: Well many shot—did any one remain alive?

00:15:00.204 --> 00:15:02.914
Robert Zeplit: Oh yes.

00:15:02.914 --> 00:15:09.521
David Boder: Now tell me then again...

00:15:09.521 --> 00:15:50.800
David Boder: This is Spool 9-139B which has come as so often to an abrupt end because we were running these spool sometimes until the last inch of wire.

David Boder: Also...um...Captain Zeplit you say that the cooperation of Germans with...[correction] the Latvians with the Germans was in most cases not voluntary.

00:16:41.124 --> 00:17:00.281
Robert Zeplit: Not voluntary because Germans is old enemies for generations. But we was forced from both sides this small nation from one side from the Russians the other from the Germans. We wasn’t able to do nothing what the Germans told us...was bound to do.

00:17:00.281 --> 00:17:05.274

Robert Zeplit: ‘R.’

00:17:47.261 --> 00:17:50.515

00:18:00.005 --> 00:18:06.763
Robert Zeplit: . . . I received orders from the Germans to prepare myself to go to Germany...

00:18:06.763 --> 00:18:07.902

00:18:22.763 --> 00:18:23.962
David Boder: All right, what did you do?

00:18:23.962 --> 00:18:42.325
Robert Zeplit: Well, but I was bringing the ship over to somewhere else. So I never show [up?] on the ship for two days and the second night, half past one, German police was at my home, took me and my wife, and put in the car and bring me to the railroad station. They never told me what and what I can guess for what.

00:18:42.325 --> 00:18:44.431
David Boder: Yes. What can you guess—what was it?

00:18:44.431 --> 00:18:45.993
Robert Zeplit: Because I never show on the ship.

00:18:45.993 --> 00:18:49.579

00:19:14.618 --> 00:19:19.956
Robert Zeplit: No. Within more about twelve hours because there wasn’t the traffic so fast as...

00:19:19.956 --> 00:19:22.666
