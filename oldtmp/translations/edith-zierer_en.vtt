00:01:11.514 --> 00:01:12.008

00:01:56.374 --> 00:02:04.308

00:02:04.308 --> 00:02:08.597
David Boder: Aha. Tell me, how old were you then?

00:02:08.597 --> 00:02:09.712
Edith Zierer: Nine years.

00:02:09.712 --> 00:02:14.814

00:02:14.814 --> 00:02:17.766
Edith Zierer: There were the father, the mother, and one sister, a younger sister.

00:02:17.766 --> 00:02:18.790

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.272

00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:21.592
David Boder: How old about was your father then?

00:02:21.592 --> 00:02:24.255
Edith Zierer: The father? Then? Forty-one years old.

00:02:24.255 --> 00:02:26.640
David Boder: Yes. Do you know where your father is?

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.111
Edith Zierer: [Barely audible voice] No.

00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:28.780
David Boder: No. And where your mother is?

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.376
Edith Zierer: Neither. They went away with a transport in ’42 to Dachau [?].

00:02:32.376 --> 00:02:33.852
David Boder: Both together? Father and mother?

00:02:33.852 --> 00:02:35.208
Edith Zierer: No. First the father.

00:02:35.208 --> 00:02:43.925
David Boder: Aha. Now then, will you please tell me the whole story. What happened, as you remember it, when the Germans arrived in Katowice. Nu.

00:02:43.925 --> 00:02:45.082
Edith Zierer: I was...

00:02:45.082 --> 00:02:45.847
David Boder: When the war started.

00:02:45.847 --> 00:02:52.594
Edith Zierer: Yes. When the war started I went with my parents to Cracow, and from Cracow to Lemberg.

00:02:52.594 --> 00:02:55.395
David Boder: Why so fast. Now how long were you in Cracow?

00:02:55.395 --> 00:02:56.540
Edith Zierer: Two days.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.299
David Boder: Why did you go to Cracow?

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:04.233
Edith Zierer: Why? Because Katowice is near the border, near the German border. And there is...were a lot of troops [apparently Polish].

00:03:04.233 --> 00:03:06.143
David Boder: Troops. So you simply left.

00:03:06.143 --> 00:03:06.396
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:03:06.396 --> 00:03:08.896
David Boder: What was the occupation of your father?

00:03:08.896 --> 00:03:10.703
Edith Zierer: He had a business.

00:03:10.703 --> 00:03:11.968
David Boder: What kind of business?

00:03:11.968 --> 00:03:13.836
Edith Zierer: Of leather. Leather.

00:03:13.836 --> 00:03:18.336
David Boder: A leather business. Did he sell leather, or things of leather?

00:03:18.336 --> 00:03:22.703
Edith Zierer: Things of leather. Leather and rugs. All kinds of merchandise.

00:03:22.703 --> 00:03:24.330
David Boder: It was a big store in Katowice.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.457
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:03:25.457 --> 00:03:33.963
David Boder: Now then, from Katowice you went to Cracow. And what did your parents do there? How long were you in Katowice?

00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:34.626
Edith Zierer: A few days [?].

00:03:34.626 --> 00:03:35.903
David Boder: Why so little?

00:03:35.903 --> 00:03:40.602
Edith Zierer: We left the 28th of September, and then the war started.

00:03:40.602 --> 00:03:42.692
David Boder: Oh. You left before the war.

00:03:42.692 --> 00:03:43.867
Edith Zierer: Yes, a few days [before].

00:03:43.867 --> 00:03:48.024
David Boder: And then, afterwards...why did you remain in Lemberg only a few days?

00:03:48.024 --> 00:03:50.777
Edith Zierer: No. We were in Lemberg one year, a whole year.

00:03:50.777 --> 00:03:52.735
David Boder: So where then were you a few days?

00:03:52.735 --> 00:03:53.783
Edith Zierer: In Cracow.

00:03:53.783 --> 00:03:54.898
David Boder: In Cracow you spent a few days.

00:03:54.898 --> 00:03:55.844
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:03:55.844 --> 00:03:57.422
David Boder: And then you went to Lemberg.

00:03:57.422 --> 00:03:57.693
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:03:57.693 --> 00:03:59.079
David Boder: And in Lemberg you spent the whole year.

00:03:59.079 --> 00:03:59.513
Edith Zierer: A whole year.

00:03:59.513 --> 00:04:01.543
David Boder: Nu. And what happened there?

00:04:01.543 --> 00:04:12.911
Edith Zierer: There was very little food. There was a [great] scarcity. We ate very badly. And when we returned to Cracow, because Lemberg was under the Russians. No [you see?]?

00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:17.260
David Boder: Oh, Lemberg, still was...That was still when the Russians and Germans were not at war.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.556
Edith Zierer: No. Before the war.

00:04:18.556 --> 00:04:20.676
David Boder: Before the war, the Germans-Russian war.

00:04:20.676 --> 00:04:21.008
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:04:21.008 --> 00:04:23.339
David Boder: So you went from Lemberg back to Prague [Cracow?].

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:23.580
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.514
David Boder: Well. Was there...

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:24.755
Edith Zierer: At the station...

00:04:24.755 --> 00:04:25.339
David Boder: . . . more to eat?

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:29.014
Edith Zierer: There was more to eat. We had relatives there. They helped us, no?

00:04:29.014 --> 00:04:29.466
David Boder: Yes.

00:04:29.466 --> 00:04:38.153
Edith Zierer: And then we...in ’41 the Ghetto was established in Cracow, so we left from Wieliczka [words not clear].

00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:42.472
David Boder: For Wieliczka. Is that the same place where Miss Kuechler was?

00:04:42.472 --> 00:04:43.316
Edith Zierer: Yes. Yes.

00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:45.406
David Boder: Yes. So you left for Wieliczka.

00:04:45.406 --> 00:04:45.677
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:04:45.677 --> 00:04:48.689
David Boder: And...now then, what happened there?

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:55.798
Edith Zierer: There we remained for a year and a half. And again an expulsion, a real expulsion, and we left for Cracow, and then...

00:04:55.798 --> 00:04:57.316
David Boder: What does it mean, an expulsion?

00:04:57.316 --> 00:04:59.937
Edith Zierer: An expulsion, a total expulsion, a Jew-clean [procedure—an ordinance to ‘free a locality of its Jews].

00:04:59.937 --> 00:05:07.130
David Boder: Oh. The city was to be made Jew-clean. And you left for Cracow alone or with a transport?

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.708
Edith Zierer: No. With the parents. We were fifteen [?] kilometers from Cracow, so we went on foot.

00:05:11.708 --> 00:05:16.178
David Boder: Oh. You went with the parents on foot to Cracow.

00:05:16.178 --> 00:05:16.389
Edith Zierer: To Cracow.

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:17.052
David Boder: You did not want...

00:05:17.052 --> 00:05:19.293
Edith Zierer: To the Aryan side. Because there was already a Ghetto.

00:05:19.293 --> 00:05:20.811
David Boder: In Cracow [there] was a Ghetto. Did you...

00:05:20.811 --> 00:05:22.136
Edith Zierer: In Cracow [there] was a Ghetto.

00:05:22.136 --> 00:05:22.709
David Boder: Yes.

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:24.348
Edith Zierer: But we went to the Aryan side.

00:05:24.348 --> 00:05:27.191
David Boder: How were you admitted to the Aryan side?

00:05:27.191 --> 00:05:31.950
Edith Zierer: We had not [words not clear]. We came [?] in on Aryan papers.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.878
David Boder: Did you have Aryan papers?

00:05:33.878 --> 00:05:36.589
Edith Zierer: The mother had Aryan papers.

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:37.444
David Boder: Oh. And you [?]?

00:05:37.444 --> 00:05:41.029
Edith Zierer: We were still very small. We did not need any [?].

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.854
David Boder: And the father?

00:05:41.854 --> 00:05:46.613
Edith Zierer: The father was hiding. He had a very Semitic appearance, so he had to hide.

00:05:46.613 --> 00:05:47.698
David Boder: What kind of an appearance?

00:05:47.698 --> 00:05:49.608
Edith Zierer: Very, very Semitic...

00:05:49.608 --> 00:05:51.668
David Boder: Semitic. He was...he looked Jewish.

00:05:51.668 --> 00:05:52.210
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.536
David Boder: So he hid himself.

00:05:53.536 --> 00:05:53.940
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.422
David Boder: And the mother with the children took the risk...

00:05:56.422 --> 00:05:56.765
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:05:56.765 --> 00:05:57.609
David Boder: . . . to pass over...to the Aryan side.

00:05:57.609 --> 00:05:58.013
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:05:58.013 --> 00:05:59.411
David Boder: And what happened then?

00:05:59.411 --> 00:06:09.212
Edith Zierer: And then we were...we were in Cracow a few days, on the Aryan side. And then somebody reported on the mama, no? A German, he did...he did...about her. He knew her.

00:06:09.212 --> 00:06:10.266
David Boder: He denounced her...

00:06:10.266 --> 00:06:16.050
Edith Zierer: Yes. He knew her, and he reported on her, and she was [taken] to the police, to the Gestapo.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.869
David Boder: And where did you remain?

00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:21.574
Edith Zierer: We...we remained in the city, with my sister, all alone.

00:06:21.574 --> 00:06:22.869
David Boder: That means the two children?

00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:23.562
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:06:23.562 --> 00:06:26.273
David Boder: You...you were nine years old, and...

00:06:26.273 --> 00:06:27.580
Edith Zierer: I was then already ten.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.809
David Boder: Ten years old. And the sister, how old was she?

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:30.140
Edith Zierer: Eight.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.665
David Boder: And they took...they took away the mother without you?

00:06:33.665 --> 00:06:34.279
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:35.725
David Boder: How did that...how did that come about?

00:06:35.725 --> 00:06:39.520
Edith Zierer: Because we remained home, and the mama went out on the street [?] and...

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.695
David Boder: She was taken on the street?

00:06:40.695 --> 00:06:43.346
Edith Zierer: Yes. And she did not return.

00:06:43.346 --> 00:06:45.256
David Boder: And your mama did not return any more?

00:06:45.256 --> 00:06:46.443
Edith Zierer: No.

00:06:46.443 --> 00:06:48.232
David Boder: Did you know what happened to her?

00:06:48.232 --> 00:06:50.324
Edith Zierer: No. We knew nothing.

00:06:50.324 --> 00:06:51.743
David Boder: Did you find out later?

00:06:51.743 --> 00:06:58.099
Edith Zierer: Yes. After four weeks we learned that she was held in the [name not clear]. That was a prison, a German prison.

00:06:58.099 --> 00:06:59.487
David Boder: Yes. And then?

00:06:59.487 --> 00:07:03.200
Edith Zierer: Well, then we went to the Ghetto by ourselves, because we had no other way out.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.576
David Boder: What does that mean? The two children?

00:07:04.576 --> 00:07:14.826
Edith Zierer: Yes. And in the Ghetto we found the father, and together with him we went to Bieżanów [district of Cracow], because in Cracow there began a resettlement [expulsion of the Jews]. And we left.

00:07:14.826 --> 00:07:17.410
David Boder: Now then, you say your father had hid himself.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.959
Edith Zierer: Yes, but he returned to the Ghetto, because he could not remain there for a long.

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:22.167
David Boder: Where he hid himself?

00:07:22.167 --> 00:07:22.427
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:07:22.427 --> 00:07:23.192
David Boder: So he returned to the Ghetto.

00:07:23.192 --> 00:07:23.594
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:07:23.594 --> 00:07:24.799
David Boder: And you found the father.

00:07:24.799 --> 00:07:25.222
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:07:25.222 --> 00:07:25.995
David Boder: How did you find him? [Chuckle.]

00:07:25.995 --> 00:07:30.178
Edith Zierer: [Laughter.] On the street. The Ghetto was very small, only a few streets. No?

00:07:30.178 --> 00:07:31.687
David Boder: You did not know that your father was there?

00:07:31.687 --> 00:07:32.925
Edith Zierer: No, I did not know.

00:07:32.925 --> 00:07:34.965
David Boder: How was it? You went out on the street and...

00:07:34.965 --> 00:07:39.130
Edith Zierer: No. I came to the Ghetto, and on the corner there stood the father.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.183
David Boder: Well, what did he say?

00:07:41.183 --> 00:07:50.346
Edith Zierer: He was very glad, but when he heard that the Mama was gone, then he already [her voice fades into silence].

00:07:50.346 --> 00:07:54.227
David Boder: [Pause. Slowly] Yes. [Pause.] Now then...and then you were with your father in the Ghetto. And what happened then?

00:07:54.227 --> 00:07:58.241
Edith Zierer: Then we went to a lager, to Bieżanów [district of Cracow] near Cracow.

00:07:58.241 --> 00:07:59.358
David Boder: You were sent away?

00:07:59.358 --> 00:08:02.587
Edith Zierer: Yes. We went by ourselves to the lager, because it was a work lager.

00:08:02.587 --> 00:08:04.278
David Boder: Your father with the children.

00:08:04.278 --> 00:08:04.568
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:08:04.568 --> 00:08:06.717
David Boder: And what work could you do?

00:08:06.717 --> 00:08:13.267
Edith Zierer: No. I could not work. They wanted to throw me out of the lager, because they accepted in the lager only [those] from the age of fifteen and up...

00:08:13.267 --> 00:08:13.587
David Boder: Nu.

00:08:13.587 --> 00:08:18.585
Edith Zierer: . . . for work. And I could not work yet. So we were thrown out, I and my sister.

00:08:18.585 --> 00:08:19.509
David Boder: What does that mean, ‘thrown out’?

00:08:19.509 --> 00:08:25.080
Edith Zierer: We were thrown out. The Germans came in, made a check-up. So they threw out.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.378
David Boder: They told you to leave?

00:08:26.378 --> 00:08:30.211
Edith Zierer: Yes. They did not tell us. We were thrown out over the wires [fence].

00:08:30.211 --> 00:08:32.475
David Boder: What does that mean? They lifted you up and threw you out?

00:08:32.475 --> 00:08:38.952
Edith Zierer: Yes. There were such wires [fences], so they threw us out. The father did not happen to be present at the moment. He was at work, and we were alone in the lager [apparently factory grounds].

00:08:38.952 --> 00:08:40.872
David Boder: Aha. And the sister, too?

00:08:40.872 --> 00:08:43.305
Edith Zierer: Too. And so we went to the Pole [the words for Poland and Pole in the dative case are the same: Polen].

00:08:43.305 --> 00:08:44.017
David Boder: To Poland?

00:08:44.017 --> 00:08:45.768
Edith Zierer: To a Pole, to a peasant.

00:08:45.768 --> 00:08:47.235
David Boder: You went to a peasant. And then?

00:08:47.235 --> 00:09:00.563
Edith Zierer: Yes. And there we stayed for some time. And I...she wanted to get some pay, so the sister remained, and I went to Cracow to the Ghetto and brought from there some money, paid up for the sister...

00:09:00.563 --> 00:09:01.004
David Boder: Yes.

00:09:01.004 --> 00:09:09.382
Edith Zierer: And I myself remained in the Ghetto, because I...I worked here [in the Ghetto] a bit. I helped out, and I lived on it. I helped out [did some chores].

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:11.495
David Boder: Aha. Your Papa was still in the Ghetto?

00:09:11.495 --> 00:09:12.026
Edith Zierer: In the lager.

00:09:12.026 --> 00:09:16.614
David Boder: In the lager. And you had returned to the lager. [Correction] Oh, you lived in the Ghetto...

00:09:16.614 --> 00:09:17.055
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:09:17.055 --> 00:09:18.129
David Boder: . . . and helped out your papa [with your earnings].

00:09:18.129 --> 00:09:18.401
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:09:18.401 --> 00:09:21.449
David Boder: And what became of your sister?

00:09:21.449 --> 00:09:34.940
Edith Zierer: Of my sister. Well, she was with a peasant. And then a deportation occurred from the lager to a large concentration camp, so I with papa [?] fetched the sister. The papa himself [did it], because he wanted that we should all be together.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:35.152
David Boder: Nu.

00:09:35.152 --> 00:09:40.150
Edith Zierer: So we all together went to a concentration camp in Plaszow. That is a large lager.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:41.285
David Boder: Yes.

00:09:41.285 --> 00:09:49.271
Edith Zierer: There I stayed for five weeks. And after five weeks I, all alone, was taken to Skarzysko, to a munitions factory.

00:09:49.271 --> 00:09:50.677
David Boder: How old were you then?

00:09:50.677 --> 00:09:52.005
Edith Zierer: Eleven years. Going into my twelfth.

00:09:52.005 --> 00:09:59.098
David Boder: Eleven years old. Now then, you went to...

00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:00.082
Edith Zierer: Skarzysko.

00:10:00.082 --> 00:10:00.402
David Boder: Pla-...

00:10:00.402 --> 00:10:01.295
Edith Zierer: Plaszow. To Plaszow.

00:10:01.295 --> 00:10:02.412
David Boder: You went to Plaszow.

00:10:02.412 --> 00:10:02.835
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:04.392
David Boder: Did you go together with you father...

00:10:04.392 --> 00:10:04.755
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:10:04.755 --> 00:10:05.407
David Boder: . . . and your sister?

00:10:05.407 --> 00:10:06.451
Edith Zierer: Yes, yes, together.

00:10:06.451 --> 00:10:08.353
David Boder: Was that permitted, men and children in one...

00:10:08.353 --> 00:10:12.114
Edith Zierer: No. That was a separate lager, but they saw each other every day.

00:10:12.114 --> 00:10:13.551
David Boder: That was a separate lager.

00:10:13.551 --> 00:10:13.871
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:10:13.871 --> 00:10:16.334
David Boder: Now tell me, when you were in the lager...

00:10:16.334 --> 00:10:16.895
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:10:16.895 --> 00:10:19.340
David Boder: . . . were there many other children?

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:30.658
Edith Zierer: There were...there was a children’s home, but I did not...I did not want to be there, because I wanted to do some work so that I could help out the papa, because the papa was very weak. He felt bad [he did not feel good]. No?

00:10:30.658 --> 00:10:31.159
David Boder: Hm.

00:10:31.159 --> 00:10:35.747
Edith Zierer: The sister was in a children’s home, and I was not in the children’s home. I worked.

00:10:35.747 --> 00:10:37.576
David Boder: A children’s home in the lager?

00:10:37.576 --> 00:10:38.469
Edith Zierer: Yes, yes.

00:10:38.469 --> 00:10:42.151
David Boder: And who managed the children’s home?

00:10:42.151 --> 00:10:45.984
Edith Zierer: The Germans didn’t know [did not care?] anything about it, but the Jews...

00:10:45.984 --> 00:10:49.576
David Boder: What do you mean? The Germans did not know that there existed a children’s home?

00:10:49.576 --> 00:10:52.081
Edith Zierer: They knew, yes. They knew, but they permitted it.

00:10:52.081 --> 00:10:53.318
David Boder: They permitted it.

00:10:53.318 --> 00:10:54.194
Edith Zierer: At the beginning.

00:10:54.194 --> 00:10:57.230
David Boder: Aha. And then you alone were taken. Where to?

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:00.007
Edith Zierer: Skarzysko-Kamienna, to an ammunition factory.

00:11:00.007 --> 00:11:02.017
David Boder: How come? Were you...

00:11:02.017 --> 00:11:08.295
Edith Zierer: There was a selection at night, so I was taken. I did not want to tell anything to the father and the sister. Not to take leave...

00:11:08.295 --> 00:11:10.154
David Boder: Where were you? Not in the children’s home?

00:11:10.154 --> 00:11:12.086
Edith Zierer: No, I was not. I worked.

00:11:12.086 --> 00:11:13.643
David Boder: You were with the women?

00:11:13.643 --> 00:11:16.843
Edith Zierer: And the papa worked somewhere else, and I [worked] somewhere else. No?

00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:17.344
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:17.344 --> 00:11:19.728
Edith Zierer: And at night...It was during a night shift.

00:11:19.728 --> 00:11:20.090
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:21.660
Edith Zierer: And at night we were taken...

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:22.463
David Boder: Aha.

00:11:22.463 --> 00:11:23.296
Edith Zierer: . . . to Skarzysko.

00:11:23.296 --> 00:11:26.453
David Boder: Now tell me, how did you travel to Skarzysko?

00:11:26.453 --> 00:11:31.572
Edith Zierer: To Skarzysko? There were a hundred people to a wagon [RR-car]. No?

00:11:31.572 --> 00:11:32.646
David Boder: Men and women?

00:11:32.646 --> 00:11:35.755
Edith Zierer: Hm. Only women. The women separately, the men separately.

00:11:35.755 --> 00:11:36.208
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:36.208 --> 00:11:46.971
Edith Zierer: And we got a slice of bread. No? We drank a little water and traveled to Skarzysko. We did not know that we traveled to Skarzysko. We thought [we were going] to Auschwitz. And...

00:11:46.971 --> 00:11:48.227
David Boder: You did not know that you...

00:11:48.227 --> 00:11:51.263
Edith Zierer: No. We thought that we were going to Auschwitz.

00:11:51.263 --> 00:11:53.527
David Boder: Did you know what was going on in Auschwitz?

00:11:53.527 --> 00:11:54.088
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:11:54.088 --> 00:11:55.386
David Boder: Now...

00:11:55.386 --> 00:12:04.893
Edith Zierer: And then in Skarzysko we were disembarked, there nine hundred people, no? So they took seventy people...There were three shops.

00:12:04.893 --> 00:12:05.316
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:05.316 --> 00:12:08.684
Edith Zierer: A [somewhat] better shop, a bad one, and one very bad, no?

00:12:08.684 --> 00:12:09.197
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:09.197 --> 00:12:14.811
Edith Zierer: They did...where one just could die at once. So I was [taken] to the first shop...

00:12:14.811 --> 00:12:15.403
David Boder: To the best one?

00:12:15.403 --> 00:12:21.759
Edith Zierer: Yes, I was taken to the best, and since I knew German I got work, no?

00:12:21.759 --> 00:12:22.031
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:22.031 --> 00:12:29.021
Edith Zierer: They did not consider that I was a child, a box under my feet, because I was too small.

00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:29.401
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:29.401 --> 00:12:30.699
Edith Zierer: And I worked.

00:12:30.699 --> 00:12:31.876
David Boder: What kind of work did you do?

00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:33.355
Edith Zierer: At munitions.

00:12:33.355 --> 00:12:33.898
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:33.898 --> 00:12:35.800
Edith Zierer: Shells.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:40.285
David Boder: Yes. And how did they behave themselves? How did they behave themselves towards you?

00:12:40.285 --> 00:12:44.408
Edith Zierer: Towards me they behaved very well, no?

00:12:44.408 --> 00:12:45.030
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:56.094
Edith Zierer: Because I was small, but still it depended on his moods. He was [?] a good man. At the beginning he behaved himself well, and then it became worse from day to day.

00:12:56.094 --> 00:12:57.603
David Boder: What was it about? What did he do?

00:12:57.603 --> 00:13:04.213
Edith Zierer: Not he. He left and other foreman came in his place. And then it was already very bad.

00:13:04.213 --> 00:13:04.636
David Boder: Why [?]?

00:13:04.636 --> 00:13:10.449
Edith Zierer: I went hungry. I worked a lot. It was an enormous...a three times increase...

00:13:10.449 --> 00:13:10.980
David Boder: What?

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.602
Edith Zierer: Three times as much of the same work had to be done.

00:13:14.602 --> 00:13:15.435
David Boder: Aha.

00:13:15.435 --> 00:13:18.350
Edith Zierer: And so they beat us...

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:19.467
David Boder: Who beat you?

00:13:19.467 --> 00:13:20.795
Edith Zierer: The Germans.

00:13:20.795 --> 00:13:22.214
David Boder: Yes. Who?

00:13:22.214 --> 00:13:23.379
Edith Zierer: The foremen.

00:13:23.379 --> 00:13:25.902
David Boder: The foremen themselves, or were there capos?

00:13:25.902 --> 00:13:27.592
Edith Zierer: No, there were no capos.

00:13:27.592 --> 00:13:29.192
David Boder: The masters themselves beat you?

00:13:29.192 --> 00:13:29.693
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:13:29.693 --> 00:13:30.327
David Boder: Now...[go on].

00:13:30.327 --> 00:13:31.915
Edith Zierer: If one made a smelt, no? [See below.]

00:13:31.915 --> 00:13:32.235
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:32.235 --> 00:13:36.660
Edith Zierer: One would get twenty with a rubber cudgel. [Her voice practically fades for the next section dealing with the beatings.]

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.338
David Boder: What does it mean, ‘when one made a smelt’?

00:13:38.338 --> 00:13:41.235
Edith Zierer: Smelt, that means a bad shell, no? [Rejected shell to be remelted.]

00:13:41.235 --> 00:13:41.567
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:41.567 --> 00:13:43.740
Edith Zierer: When they...there was an inspection [control].

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:43.982
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:43.982 --> 00:13:53.236
Edith Zierer: A continuous German control. If somebody made it wrong, a smelt—that was called a smelt—then he would get a beating.

00:13:53.236 --> 00:13:54.582
David Boder: With a rubber cudgel.

00:13:54.582 --> 00:13:55.397
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:13:55.397 --> 00:13:56.381
David Boder: Nu.

00:13:56.381 --> 00:14:10.433
Edith Zierer: And then in ’43 we went away to the third lager...[corrects herself] the fourth lager already, to Czestochowa. And in Czestochowa we were for a year and a half, and there the Russians...

00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:12.395
David Boder: You were for a year and a half in Czestochowa.

00:14:12.395 --> 00:14:12.715
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:14:12.715 --> 00:14:14.194
David Boder: And there the Russians liberated you.

00:14:14.194 --> 00:14:14.828
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:14:14.828 --> 00:14:15.854
David Boder: And there you were all alone?

00:14:15.854 --> 00:14:16.488
Edith Zierer: All alone.

00:14:16.488 --> 00:14:20.623
David Boder: Didn’t you since then, while you were in the other factory...

00:14:20.623 --> 00:14:21.064
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:14:21.064 --> 00:14:22.772
David Boder: Didn’t you hear anything from the father, your sister?

00:14:22.772 --> 00:14:24.764
Edith Zierer: No, no, nothing.

00:14:24.764 --> 00:14:26.515
David Boder: And you don’t know where your sister is now?

00:14:26.515 --> 00:14:34.410
Edith Zierer: No, nothing. She probably went to Auschwitz, and there the children, too, were [voice fades] done away with.

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:41.865
David Boder: In Auschwitz [in subdued tone like an echo] the children were done away with? [In normal voice] Now then the Russian had liberated you. And what happened then?

00:14:41.865 --> 00:14:46.241
Edith Zierer: Then I returned to Katowice, because I thought that the parents were there. So I...

00:14:46.241 --> 00:14:48.535
David Boder: What does it mean, ‘you returned’? How did you return to...

00:14:48.535 --> 00:14:51.998
Edith Zierer: The Russians were not any more in Chenstokhov, so I returned [retreated?] together with the Russians.

00:14:51.998 --> 00:14:53.404
David Boder: What does that mean, ‘with the Russians’?

00:14:53.404 --> 00:14:54.944
Edith Zierer: Together with the army.

00:14:54.944 --> 00:14:56.411
David Boder: By train or how?

00:14:56.411 --> 00:14:57.063
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:14:57.063 --> 00:14:58.983
David Boder: By train? Did they admit you?

00:14:58.983 --> 00:14:59.907
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:14:59.907 --> 00:15:01.947
David Boder: And you returned. Where to?

00:15:01.947 --> 00:15:03.305
Edith Zierer: To Katowice.

00:15:03.305 --> 00:15:04.845
David Boder: Yes, and...

00:15:04.845 --> 00:15:21.765
Edith Zierer: In Katowice I did not find anybody, no? The parents were there no more. The house was lead-sealed [plumbed], and I could not get in at all. And I spent a few weeks with the Committee [in a shelter], and then I went to Cracow, and they took me with them [her voice fades]...

00:15:21.765 --> 00:15:22.477
David Boder: What?

00:15:22.477 --> 00:15:23.763
Edith Zierer: They were with [?] me.

00:15:23.763 --> 00:15:23.914
David Boder: Aha?

00:15:23.914 --> 00:15:25.091
Edith Zierer: They helped me.

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:28.291
David Boder: Why was the house lead-sealed? Was this your own house [your property]?

00:15:28.291 --> 00:15:34.617
Edith Zierer: Yes, that was our own house. When the Germans left they plumbed it.

00:15:34.617 --> 00:15:36.657
David Boder: Oh. Couldn’t you tear off the plumb?

00:15:36.657 --> 00:15:38.589
Edith Zierer: No, that was [prohibited]...that was not permitted.

00:15:38.589 --> 00:15:39.935
David Boder: But the Russians were already there.

00:15:39.935 --> 00:15:46.001
Edith Zierer: Yes, but the Russians did not permit it, because I was not yet eighteen years old.

00:15:46.001 --> 00:15:47.571
David Boder: You were not yet eighteen, and...?

00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:57.911
Edith Zierer: That is what I was told, no? When I shall be eighteen years old I will get the apartment back. Because nobody else from the family had remained, and I was [allegedly] too young to have my own apartment.

00:15:57.911 --> 00:16:00.326
David Boder: Aha. And no one else lived there?

00:16:00.326 --> 00:16:03.272
Edith Zierer: There were Russians afterwards [?], an officer [?].

00:16:03.272 --> 00:16:05.312
David Boder: Aha. And he entered the apartment.

00:16:05.312 --> 00:16:06.248
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:16:06.248 --> 00:16:08.530
David Boder: Did you see? Were your things there?

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:09.484
Edith Zierer: No.

00:16:09.484 --> 00:16:11.494
David Boder: Aha. Talk in this direction [towards the microphone].

00:16:11.494 --> 00:16:13.214
Edith Zierer: No, nothing was there any more.

00:16:13.214 --> 00:16:17.349
David Boder: And to what kind of a woman did you go? A Jewess or a...? [She must have mentioned this woman aside from the microphone.]

00:16:17.349 --> 00:16:18.617
Edith Zierer: A Jewess.

00:16:18.617 --> 00:16:18.967
David Boder: And...

00:16:18.967 --> 00:16:24.852
Edith Zierer: She took me in, and I had it very good with her.

00:16:24.852 --> 00:16:27.991
David Boder: Yes. And then? You were five [?] weeks there?

00:16:27.991 --> 00:16:31.492
Edith Zierer: And then I was sent to Zakopane.

00:16:31.492 --> 00:16:32.337
David Boder: Who?

00:16:32.337 --> 00:16:33.786
Edith Zierer: The Committee.

00:16:33.786 --> 00:16:35.355
David Boder: Which Committee was that?

00:16:35.355 --> 00:16:37.347
Edith Zierer: The Committee of Katowice, a Jewish Committee.

00:16:37.347 --> 00:16:39.702
David Boder: Yes. And how far is Zakopane from Katowice?

00:16:39.702 --> 00:16:41.984
Edith Zierer: From Katowice? One hundred and fifty kilometers.

00:16:41.984 --> 00:16:42.998
David Boder: Aha.

00:16:42.998 --> 00:16:44.115
Edith Zierer: That is a children’s home, no? That is [words not clear].

00:16:44.115 --> 00:16:46.849
David Boder: Yes. They sent you to a children’s home where...

00:16:46.849 --> 00:16:47.181
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:16:47.181 --> 00:16:47.936
David Boder: . . . Mrs. Kuechler was?

00:16:47.936 --> 00:16:48.346
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:16:48.346 --> 00:16:50.550
David Boder: And...what happened then?

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:56.061
Edith Zierer: I had it very good there. I studied, and then we left for France.

00:16:56.061 --> 00:16:59.773
David Boder: Why did you leave for France? What happened there?

00:16:59.773 --> 00:17:03.697
Edith Zierer: The Poles. The Poles were beating up, no?

00:17:03.697 --> 00:17:04.349
David Boder: Whom.

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:10.162
Edith Zierer: The Jews. We were...we were going to school, to the gymnasium [secondary school], and they beat us up, and...

00:17:10.162 --> 00:17:11.387
David Boder: Who beat you? The children at school, yes?

00:17:11.387 --> 00:17:12.927
Edith Zierer: Yes, the children at school.

00:17:12.927 --> 00:17:13.971
David Boder: Why?

00:17:13.971 --> 00:17:16.084
Edith Zierer: [They were] anti-Semitic. Well...

00:17:16.084 --> 00:17:19.935
David Boder: Well, yes. But the war...the Poles were liberated. They were...

00:17:19.935 --> 00:17:33.547
Edith Zierer: Well, but they did not want...In Zakopane there were very many Jews, and they did not want any Jews. They could not look at the Jews. And they...the Jews were beaten up. A better seat in the [classroom]...

00:17:33.547 --> 00:17:36.493
David Boder: And what did the teachers say? The Police?

00:17:36.493 --> 00:17:43.562
Edith Zierer: The teachers—nothing. The director intervened some. Yes, yes.

00:17:43.562 --> 00:17:44.395
David Boder: What?

00:17:44.395 --> 00:17:47.673
Edith Zierer: The director hollered...hollered at them.

00:17:47.673 --> 00:17:48.627
David Boder: He scolded them a bit.

00:17:48.627 --> 00:17:49.098
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:17:49.098 --> 00:17:51.048
David Boder: But they paid no heed.

00:17:51.048 --> 00:17:51.851
Edith Zierer: No, not at all.

00:17:51.851 --> 00:17:56.728
David Boder: Nu, and then what was going on in Zakopane? What happened then?

00:17:56.728 --> 00:18:02.885
Edith Zierer: So we left. The...the...Mrs. Kuechler has...that is, we departed with her.

00:18:02.885 --> 00:18:05.058
David Boder: And where did you go?

00:18:05.058 --> 00:18:11.396
Edith Zierer: First to Prague. And from Prague—we were a week in Prague—and then to France.

00:18:11.396 --> 00:18:13.690
David Boder: How did you go to France, by...

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:14.746
Edith Zierer: By bus.

00:18:14.746 --> 00:18:17.349
David Boder: By bus. [Chuckle.] All sixty children in one...

00:18:17.349 --> 00:18:18.406
Edith Zierer: Two busses.

00:18:18.406 --> 00:18:22.499
David Boder: Two busses. Who provided these busses?

00:18:22.499 --> 00:18:24.358
Edith Zierer: That was an organization who provided...

00:18:24.358 --> 00:18:27.950
David Boder: You don’t know what kind of organization? Now, what are you now doing here?

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:30.262
Edith Zierer: Here? We study...

00:18:30.262 --> 00:18:32.242
David Boder: What are you studying?

00:18:32.242 --> 00:18:34.826
Edith Zierer: I attend the second year of Gymnasium.

00:18:34.826 --> 00:18:36.323
David Boder: You are going to school here.

00:18:36.323 --> 00:18:39.510
Edith Zierer: No. We have it at home. We have a professor and a woman teacher.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:39.902
David Boder: Yes.

00:18:39.902 --> 00:18:42.558
Edith Zierer: And we study Hebrew, French...

00:18:42.558 --> 00:18:42.890
David Boder: Nu.

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:46.814
Edith Zierer: And we studied English, but now we can’t study three languages at once.

00:18:46.814 --> 00:18:48.178
David Boder: Yes, and one shouldn’t.

00:18:48.178 --> 00:18:53.611
Edith Zierer: So we study two languages, geography, history, and...

00:18:53.611 --> 00:18:54.414
David Boder: . . . et cetera.

00:18:54.414 --> 00:18:55.006
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:18:55.006 --> 00:18:56.956
David Boder: Do you work? Do you help with the chores?

00:18:56.956 --> 00:19:07.507
Edith Zierer: Yes, every child helps here. Every week...every week a different child has duty in the kitchen, no? She works. Or a duty [?] in the house, in the garden.

00:19:07.507 --> 00:19:09.771
David Boder: And who attends [takes care of] the little children?

00:19:09.771 --> 00:19:13.381
Edith Zierer: There are such two women, no?

00:19:13.381 --> 00:19:14.878
David Boder: Two women take care of the small children.

00:19:14.878 --> 00:19:15.409
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:19:15.409 --> 00:19:17.220
David Boder: Do you have to help out with it?

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.669
Edith Zierer: No, not now any more.

00:19:18.669 --> 00:19:23.184
David Boder: Nu, and what do you think will become of you?

00:19:23.184 --> 00:19:24.150
Edith Zierer: I don’t know.

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:32.287
David Boder: Oh. [Pause.] What do you want to learn? What would you like to study? What do you like to learn?

00:19:32.287 --> 00:19:34.840
Edith Zierer: I want to study? [Pause.]

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.319
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:36.319 --> 00:19:38.915
Edith Zierer: I don’t know [?].

00:19:38.915 --> 00:19:40.865
David Boder: How much schooling did you have?

00:19:40.865 --> 00:19:51.205
Edith Zierer: Schooling? I have studied...four grades, completed, no? And when the war was over I went to Zakopane, to the first grade of the Gymnaisum [apparently high school level]. And then...

00:19:51.205 --> 00:19:55.974
David Boder: Now, do you want to learn some trade?

00:19:55.974 --> 00:20:00.399
Edith Zierer: A trade. Maybe [?] no. I enjoy very much to study languages, no?

00:20:00.399 --> 00:20:01.383
David Boder: What languages?

00:20:01.383 --> 00:20:02.940
Edith Zierer: Makes no difference.

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:05.053
David Boder: Hm. And where do you all intend to go?

00:20:05.053 --> 00:20:06.683
Edith Zierer: To Palestine, for sure.

00:20:06.683 --> 00:20:08.240
David Boder: You are for sure to go to Palestine?

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.357
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:20:09.357 --> 00:20:13.009
David Boder: Well. There you will mostly work on the land?

00:20:13.009 --> 00:20:14.325
Edith Zierer: Well, maybe.

00:20:14.325 --> 00:20:17.482
David Boder: Do you like it here?

00:20:17.482 --> 00:20:20.669
Edith Zierer: Yes, very much.

00:20:20.669 --> 00:20:29.693
David Boder: Well. Could you tell me, if I ask you about all this time, which was the hardest moment in your life?

00:20:29.693 --> 00:20:55.781
Edith Zierer: The hardest moment was when they took away the mama. I remained all alone with the sister. Without a penny, we had no money, no? And we did not know where the father was. We remained all alone on the Aryan side. And then when I left, without the parents, without the father and the sister, for Skarzysko.

00:20:55.781 --> 00:21:03.707
David Boder: Now...When you worked in the munitions factory, where did you sleep?

00:21:03.707 --> 00:21:11.361
Edith Zierer: There were long barracks. I did [words not clear]. The beds [?] were mounted. Hundred fifty people were in a long barracks.

00:21:11.361 --> 00:21:12.556
David Boder: Women alone?

00:21:12.556 --> 00:21:14.729
Edith Zierer: Yes, separate. The women were separate, the men separate.

00:21:14.729 --> 00:21:17.174
David Boder: Was your hair...hair shorn?

00:21:17.174 --> 00:21:19.305
Edith Zierer: Well, only from the head.

00:21:19.305 --> 00:21:20.470
David Boder: Otherwise not.

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:21.152
Edith Zierer: No.

00:21:21.152 --> 00:21:23.385
David Boder: Were you able to keep clean there?

00:21:23.385 --> 00:21:24.080
Edith Zierer: Yes.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.336
David Boder: Did they give soap?

00:21:25.336 --> 00:21:36.400
Edith Zierer: Very little. But we were...because in a munitions factory there is a lot of soap, we had...and soda. So we washed ourselves with that soda. It was smarting badly, but...

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:41.441
David Boder: Yes. So you washed yourselves with the soda. What was there soap for in the munitions factory?

00:21:41.441 --> 00:21:44.206
Edith Zierer: So, to wash the shells [?]. The shells [?] were washed.

00:21:44.206 --> 00:21:46.790
David Boder: Oh. So you took some soap with you, or what?

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:57.332
Edith Zierer: It was not permitted to take [it]. One got beaten for it, but sometimes one would get it from the foreman, when he was in a good mood [?].

00:21:57.332 --> 00:22:13.289
David Boder: [In English] This concludes the interview with Edith Zierer, a fifteen year old girl who is now in the home for displaced children at Bellevue near Paris. An Illinois Institute of Technology wire recording.
