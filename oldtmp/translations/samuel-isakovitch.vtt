Samuel Isakovitch: No, it was arranged...every block had its people. As many people the block had...then they were lined up. There came the lager-fuehrer, the block obersturm-fuehrer, and counted how many people there are in the block. Then if it was correct, good. And if not—then he looked so long, till he was found.

00:08:13.082 --> 00:08:14.742
David Boder: And if he wasn’t found?

00:08:14.742 --> 00:08:17.722
Samuel Isakovitch: Then another ten were taken and shot.

00:08:17.722 --> 00:08:19.231
David Boder: Why? If somebody ran away?

00:08:19.231 --> 00:08:23.396
Samuel Isakovitch: If somebody escaped, another ten were taken and shot.

00:08:23.396 --> 00:08:25.328
David Boder: Where? Right there?

00:08:25.328 --> 00:08:30.217
Samuel Isakovitch: Not right there. They were taken out. They were taken behind the lager and immediately shot.

00:08:30.217 --> 00:08:31.346
David Boder: Was it their fault that...

00:08:31.346 --> 00:08:31.610
Samuel Isakovitch: But...

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:33.149
David Boder: ...another one escaped [?]?

00:08:33.149 --> 00:08:39.004
Samuel Isakovitch: They said thus, “Who...in case anybody escapes, other ten comrades will be shot.’

00:08:39.004 --> 00:08:39.366
David Boder: Hm.

00:08:39.366 --> 00:08:40.392
Samuel Isakovitch: So that nobody should escape.

00:08:40.392 --> 00:08:41.660
David Boder: Did anybody escape?

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:42.686
Samuel Isakovitch: Some[?].

00:08:42.686 --> 00:08:43.018
David Boder: Yes.

00:08:43.018 --> 00:08:46.193
Samuel Isakovitch: Who could escape.

00:08:46.193 --> 00:08:47.702
David Boder: Who was able, ran away?

00:08:47.702 --> 00:08:49.121
Samuel Isakovitch: Who could escaped.

00:08:49.121 --> 00:08:52.048
David Boder: Didn’t he know that ten of his comrades will be shot?

00:08:52.048 --> 00:08:58.114
Samuel Isakovitch: He knew; but he wanted his life...wanted his life...first of all...

00:08:58.114 --> 00:09:00.589
David Boder: Did they really shoot ten people every time?

00:09:00.589 --> 00:09:02.490
Samuel Isakovitch: Always.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:03.184
David Boder: What?

00:09:03.184 --> 00:09:17.446
Samuel Isakovitch: They shot always. They shot always, whenever somebody escaped. And then when one escaped he was [considered] committing sabotage; and for sabotage one was hanged.

00:09:17.446 --> 00:09:19.888
David Boder: What kind of sabotage?

00:09:19.888 --> 00:09:39.426
Samuel Isakovitch: Sabotage...was...when something by the construction—by the construction detail...if one broke anything or anything... if one didn’t put on the five hundred bricks a day, then this was also considered sabotage. He was also hanged like the others. The electricians or machinists...we worked at machines...

00:09:39.426 --> 00:09:39.758
David Boder: Hm.

00:09:39.758 --> 00:09:48.148
Samuel Isakovitch: ...they were also hanged like the others if they didn’t work the way they should have.

00:09:48.148 --> 00:09:50.653
David Boder: Who was it who said that they didn’t work?

00:09:50.653 --> 00:09:56.840
Samuel Isakovitch: The...the master, the foreman, the Oberschar-fuehrer...

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.293
David Boder: Hm.

00:09:57.293 --> 00:10:00.583
Samuel Isakovitch: ...the block leader [a few words not clear]...

00:10:00.583 --> 00:10:01.096
David Boder: Hm.

00:10:01.096 --> 00:10:02.032
Samuel Isakovitch: [Not clear.]

00:10:02.032 --> 00:10:05.744
David Boder: Nu, and so, in the morning you had what, the appell?

00:10:05.744 --> 00:10:11.116
Samuel Isakovitch: Yes, in the morning...then at six o’clock we began working.

00:10:11.116 --> 00:10:11.388
David Boder: Yes?

00:10:11.388 --> 00:10:18.558
Samuel Isakovitch: We worked till the evening. We worked till dinner time, [the mid-day meal]. For dinner we had half an hour and then again...

00:10:18.558 --> 00:10:19.916
David Boder: What were you given to eat for dinner?

00:10:19.916 --> 00:10:27.129
Samuel Isakovitch: At dinner time nothing. In the morning we were given bread and a little piece of margarine and coffee...[Footnote: It was assumed that the prisoners would save part of their bread ration for dinner and even for supper. But in most cases they either ate the whole ration in the morning or traded it away for cigarettes or other objects or favors.]

00:10:27.129 --> 00:10:27.582
David Boder: Hm.

00:10:27.582 --> 00:10:29.574
Samuel Isakovitch: ...and in the evening a liter of soup.

00:10:29.574 --> 00:10:31.143
David Boder: And for dinner [mid-day] you weren’t given anything to eat?

00:10:31.143 --> 00:10:32.260
Samuel Isakovitch: No.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:37.874
David Boder: So? Nu, you only rested at mid-day time?

00:10:37.874 --> 00:10:41.513
Samuel Isakovitch: Yes, we rested for half an hour. And then we started to work again.

00:10:41.513 --> 00:10:42.871
David Boder: And how late did you work?

00:10:42.871 --> 00:10:49.792
Samuel Isakovitch: We worked till six o’clock in the evening and then we marched in. And again we stood on the appell square till ten o’clock at night.

00:10:49.792 --> 00:10:50.728
David Boder: Why so long?

00:10:50.728 --> 00:11:02.740
Samuel Isakovitch: Why? They had time. They had time...they wanted...till the lager-fuehrer came; till the block-fuehrer came. Then the music didn’t play well.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.513
David Boder: What kind of music did you have in the lager?

00:11:04.513 --> 00:11:07.701
Samuel Isakovitch: While marching out and marching in there had to be music.

00:11:07.701 --> 00:11:08.033
David Boder: Why?

00:11:08.033 --> 00:11:09.391
Samuel Isakovitch: To march better.

00:11:09.391 --> 00:11:11.172
David Boder: Yes. So, who played the music?

00:11:11.172 --> 00:11:12.530
Samuel Isakovitch: Our men.

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:14.431
David Boder: Where did you get the instruments?

00:11:14.431 --> 00:11:16.937
Samuel Isakovitch: We already got them from Auschwitz.

00:11:16.937 --> 00:11:19.441
David Boder: What do you mean ‘from Auschwitz’? They have sent...

00:11:19.441 --> 00:11:19.864
Samuel Isakovitch: Yes.

00:11:19.864 --> 00:11:20.498
David Boder: ...instruments from Auschwitz...

00:11:20.498 --> 00:11:24.240
Samuel Isakovitch: Yes, and then we too went away to Auschwitz...

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:24.784
David Boder: What?

00:11:24.784 --> 00:11:26.052
Samuel Isakovitch: And then we too left for Ausch-...

00:11:26.052 --> 00:11:32.420
David Boder: Now wait, we are not through with this camp. So, in the evening what? Music played when you returned?

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:32.782
Samuel Isakovitch: Yes.

00:11:32.782 --> 00:11:34.140
David Boder: Yes? And then?

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:35.045
Samuel Isakovitch: And then...

00:11:35.045 --> 00:11:35.317
David Boder: Yes?

00:11:35.317 --> 00:11:38.999
Samuel Isakovitch: ...and then we went in...stood for appell...

00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:39.241
David Boder: Hm.

00:11:39.241 --> 00:11:44.161
Samuel Isakovitch: Finished with the appell, we entered the ‘block’ and received the soup...

00:11:44.161 --> 00:11:44.402
David Boder: Yes?

00:11:44.402 --> 00:11:50.167
Samuel Isakovitch: ...and then, at nine o’clock, feet-washing and lay down to sleep.

00:11:50.167 --> 00:11:54.181
David Boder: Feet-washing. Were you given water and soap for that purpose?

00:11:54.181 --> 00:11:56.958
Samuel Isakovitch: One received soap and water.

00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:57.441
David Boder: Yes?

00:11:57.441 --> 00:11:58.105
Samuel Isakovitch: Yes.

00:11:58.105 --> 00:12:02.202
David Boder: And the soup. Did everyone have a plate for himself?

00:12:02.202 --> 00:12:10.441
Samuel Isakovitch: Yes...as we stood in line, when one finished eating, the other got it. He took from the other one the...the plate and then...he ate.

00:12:10.441 --> 00:12:12.222
David Boder: So everyone did not have a plate of his own?

00:12:12.222 --> 00:12:17.142
Samuel Isakovitch: No. To a ‘block’ there were maybe forty plates...

00:12:17.142 --> 00:12:17.715
David Boder: Yes, so?

00:12:17.715 --> 00:12:21.427
Samuel Isakovitch: ...and from these forty, the other two, three hundred ate.

00:12:21.427 --> 00:12:22.996
David Boder: Did they wash the plates?

00:12:22.996 --> 00:12:32.141
Samuel Isakovitch: Who...who would do it? Nothing was washed. Everyone in line wanted to eat quickly...one had to hurry.

00:12:32.141 --> 00:12:41.050
David Boder: Yes. Nu, tell me this. And then, in the evening, did they allow you to talk to one another?

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:51.765
Samuel Isakovitch: One could...it was permitted...by the time we had washed our feet, we already had to go to sleep. There was ‘foot control’...

00:12:51.765 --> 00:12:53.607
David Boder: What...what was the ‘foot control’?

00:12:53.607 --> 00:12:56.841
Samuel Isakovitch: The feet were looked over [as to]whether they were clean.

00:12:56.841 --> 00:12:59.679
David Boder: Why did they bother so much about the feet and not about ‘the rest’?

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:06.572
Samuel Isakovitch: Everything was looked over, but in the evening, the feet were checked whether they are clean...whether they don’t stink.

00:13:06.572 --> 00:13:12.789
David Boder: Oh! And how did you sleep? What did you sleep on?

00:13:12.789 --> 00:13:15.092
Samuel Isakovitch: We slept on a plank bed, on boards.

00:13:15.092 --> 00:13:18.593
David Boder: Ah. And how close was one to another?

00:13:18.593 --> 00:13:25.655
Samuel Isakovitch: We were together...pushed together...one centimeter one from another...everybody together; squeezed together like herrings.

00:13:25.655 --> 00:13:28.944
David Boder: O.K. Did you have blankets to cover yourselves?

00:13:28.944 --> 00:13:31.570
Samuel Isakovitch: We were given a blanket for two people.

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.049
David Boder: Oh! You were given for two people...

00:13:33.049 --> 00:13:33.984
Samuel Isakovitch: For two people, one blanket.

00:13:33.984 --> 00:13:36.640
David Boder: So, you...you slept practically together.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.990
Samuel Isakovitch: Yes. [We] slept together.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:42.012
David Boder: And how long were you in this lager?

00:13:42.012 --> 00:13:46.600
Samuel Isakovitch: Until...until the year forty-four, in May.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:50.644
David Boder: Aha. And what happened then? What was the name of this lager?

00:13:50.644 --> 00:13:51.489
Samuel Isakovitch: Posen.

00:13:51.489 --> 00:13:53.511
David Boder: Posen. And what happened then?

00:13:53.511 --> 00:14:00.905
Samuel Isakovitch: Then we went away to Auschwitz. The camp was disabanded, and we were taken to Auschwitz

00:14:00.905 --> 00:14:01.962
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:01.962 --> 00:14:19.168
Samuel Isakovitch: In Auschwitz we came to Birkenau. There they made the ‘selections’. Who was good, who was able to work and was healthy, he went to work to the coal mines in Janina. And who wasn’t, he was taken away because he wasn’t able to work.

00:14:19.168 --> 00:14:20.617
David Boder: And what was done with them?

00:14:20.617 --> 00:14:39.377
Samuel Isakovitch: They went into the crematory. [Pause.] I went away to the coal mines in Janina. And in Janina the youngsters up to eighteen years, were taken out and taken to Monowitz—there to a rubber factory. We worked...

00:14:39.377 --> 00:14:41.772
David Boder: These were the ones under eighteen years...

00:14:41.772 --> 00:14:42.547
Samuel Isakovitch: Yes.

00:14:42.547 --> 00:14:43.976
David Boder: ...were taken to the...

00:14:43.976 --> 00:14:51.582
Samuel Isakovitch: Where taken to the rubber factory in Monowitz. [Pause].

00:14:51.582 --> 00:14:54.359
David Boder: Yes. So, then you were in Monowitz in the rubber factory?

00:14:54.359 --> 00:14:55.446
Samuel Isakovitch: Yes.

00:14:55.446 --> 00:14:55.786
David Boder: And the...

00:14:55.786 --> 00:14:56.502
Samuel Isakovitch: Work...

00:14:56.502 --> 00:14:56.985
David Boder: Yes?

00:14:56.985 --> 00:15:08.731
Samuel Isakovitch: We worked in Monowitz in the rubber factory...we worked until the year forty-five, up to January the eighteenth. January the eighteenth...

00:15:08.731 --> 00:15:09.747
David Boder: January the eighteenth.

00:15:09.747 --> 00:15:17.383
Samuel Isakovitch: Yes. January the eighteenth we were taken away...we were evacuated to the Concentration Camp Buchenwald?

00:15:17.383 --> 00:15:19.586
David Boder: Oh! Were you in Buchenwald?

00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:19.858
Samuel Isakovitch: Yes.

00:15:19.858 --> 00:15:22.420
David Boder: Tell me a little about Buchenwald.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:26.649
Samuel Isakovitch: We arrived in Buchenwald in January...

00:15:26.649 --> 00:15:27.373
David Boder: ...in January.

00:15:27.373 --> 00:15:35.703
Samuel Isakovitch: ...in January. And then we were taken and first of all everybody was disinfected.

00:15:35.703 --> 00:15:35.975
David Boder: Yes?

00:15:35.975 --> 00:15:59.112
Samuel Isakovitch: At the time of disinfection, we had come from Auschwitz to...to Buchenwald. It took us twelve days. Three quarters had died from hunger. And we remained, from fourteen thousand, we only remained two-thousand eight hundred men, exactly. Because, I know precisely the numbers...there we were given numbers...everybody received a number...

00:15:59.112 --> 00:15:59.384
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:59.384 --> 00:16:04.364
Samuel Isakovitch: ...it was [starting] from a hundred and twenty thousand to a hundred twenty-two thousand eight hundred.

00:16:04.364 --> 00:16:04.756
David Boder: Hm.

00:16:04.756 --> 00:16:27.185
Samuel Isakovitch: I know that exactly two thousand eight hundred have remained from our transport out of fourteen thousand people. The others were murdered...shot...in Slovakia...shot, and starved to death, and they were murdered...Then we came to Buchenwald. We were taken into the disinfection [hall], and there a quarter was murdered.

00:16:27.185 --> 00:16:28.513
David Boder: What does it mean, ‘they were murdered’?

00:16:28.513 --> 00:17:15.032
Samuel Isakovitch: They were taken into...the disinfection [chamber]. So they started...were dirty...so they rubbed so long till...they began to clip off the hair with machines...from all over...so long...we undressed...we were like the flies...food we didn’t get for six days...except what the civilian population in Czechoslovakie threw into the RR-cars. And the children who were going to school saw us from the bridges...it was so...they threw into the RR-cars a little piece of bread or anything they could...when they were going to school...and on this we endured a little...and snow helped...

00:17:15.032 --> 00:17:15.998
David Boder: What about the snow?

00:17:15.998 --> 00:17:17.266
Samuel Isakovitch: Snow....we ate the snow.

00:17:17.266 --> 00:17:17.991
David Boder: The white snow.

00:17:17.991 --> 00:17:19.439
David Boder: Oh, it was cold then?

00:17:19.439 --> 00:17:19.862
Samuel Isakovitch: Yes.

00:17:19.862 --> 00:17:21.970
David Boder: Oh. That one ate for water?

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:26.920
Samuel Isakovitch: It was eaten for bread and for water...for anything...we ate it from hunger.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:27.222
David Boder: Nu?

00:17:27.222 --> 00:17:32.836
Samuel Isakovitch: We didn’t have anything else to eat. The RR-cars were full of the dead...with the dead people...

00:17:32.836 --> 00:17:36.609
David Boder: Tell me, what does it mean dead...died of hunger...eh...

00:17:36.609 --> 00:17:37.394
Samuel Isakovitch: From hunger, yes.

00:17:37.394 --> 00:17:41.551
David Boder: A man really...simply died...?

00:17:41.551 --> 00:17:43.310
Samuel Isakovitch: He simply died...one simply murdered the other!

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.849
David Boder: Why did you murder one another?

00:17:44.849 --> 00:17:49.083
Samuel Isakovitch: One another...so that...we took. One was hungry...

00:17:49.083 --> 00:17:49.153
David Boder: Yes?

00:17:49.153 --> 00:17:53.227
Samuel Isakovitch: ...the oth-...we couldn’t go out from the RR-cars because you were immediately shot...

00:17:53.227 --> 00:17:53.559
David Boder: Nu?

00:17:53.559 --> 00:17:56.939
Samuel Isakovitch: ...and somebody saw there was a little snow...Snow was falling...

00:17:56.939 --> 00:17:57.140
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:07.680
Samuel Isakovitch: ...on the sides of the RR-cars. We took off a little snow with the hands...and the other person saw it. So he wanted to take away the little snow so he could eat it. Then he took his wooden shoe off his foot...

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:07.830
David Boder: Hm.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:15.375
Samuel Isakovitch: ...he gave it to him right over the head. He gave it to him over the head...he fell down...he was trambled on...he never used to get up any more.

00:18:15.375 --> 00:18:16.371
David Boder: One to the other?

00:18:16.371 --> 00:18:32.657
Samuel Isakovitch: Yes, one to the other. So, there remained...a half of the RR-car were dead. We were a hundred and sixty-five men in a RR-car. We were a hundred and sixty-five persons to a RR-car. We were embarked in Gleiwitz. In the lager
                        Gleiwitz we were embarked one hundred sixty-five people to a RR-car.

00:18:32.657 --> 00:18:34.528
David Boder: What kind of RR-cars were they?

00:18:34.528 --> 00:18:35.765
Samuel Isakovitch: Open ones.

00:18:35.765 --> 00:18:37.395
David Boder: Open ones? What do you mean by open RR-cars?

00:18:37.395 --> 00:18:38.542
Samuel Isakovitch: Completely open.

00:18:38.542 --> 00:18:39.176
David Boder: No roof?

00:18:39.176 --> 00:18:40.323
Samuel Isakovitch: No roof.

00:18:40.323 --> 00:18:44.397
David Boder: Oh, they were the railroad cars used for transportation of lumber and machinery.

00:18:44.397 --> 00:18:45.333
Samuel Isakovitch: Lumber...on these...

00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:48.562
David Boder: So how did people stand on the railroad cars while the train was in motion?

00:18:48.562 --> 00:18:50.856
Samuel Isakovitch: That’s how they stood.

00:18:50.856 --> 00:18:52.059
David Boder: Hm.

00:18:52.059 --> 00:18:53.266
Samuel Isakovitch: That’s how they stood.

00:18:53.266 --> 00:18:55.831
David Boder: And this was where? This was already in Buch-...No?

00:18:55.831 --> 00:18:58.668
Samuel Isakovitch: No. From Auschwitz to Buchenwald, when we were taken...evacuated...

00:18:58.668 --> 00:18:59.121
David Boder: Uh-huh.

00:18:59.121 --> 00:19:00.419
Samuel Isakovitch: ...from Auschwitz to Buchenwald.

00:19:00.419 --> 00:19:03.028
David Boder: Nu, and in Buchenwald, you tell me, they began to clip...

00:19:03.028 --> 00:19:03.390
Samuel Isakovitch: Began...

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:04.024
David Boder: ...your hair...

00:19:04.024 --> 00:19:33.061
Samuel Isakovitch: The hair...there, when we came in, we hadn’t eaten for six days and then, when we came in there, until the names were written down, until everybody’s index card was made out. It also took three days till we entered the blocks...and we bathed. We only received a shirt and a piece of trousers and a pair of wooden shoes...and cold...it was so cold that nobody could...a person couldn’t...a person soon froze.

00:19:33.061 --> 00:19:34.238
David Boder: Which month was it in?

00:19:34.238 --> 00:19:34.993
Samuel Isakovitch: In January.

00:19:34.993 --> 00:19:35.597
David Boder: In January.

00:19:35.597 --> 00:19:36.201
Samuel Isakovitch: In January.

00:19:36.201 --> 00:19:36.834
David Boder: Now then...

00:19:36.834 --> 00:20:14.292
Samuel Isakovitch: And when one came out after bathing...he went outside improperly dressed in only...he only had something like a shirt...nothing...and when he stepped outside he immediately caught col...froze up, and remained lying outside near the blocks. Then every morning we threw the dead into the latrine...every morning we covered the dead with sand... [those] that have lain on the ground. Then in the morning we went out for appell...and we were given once a day to eat...we were given at twelve o’clock in the Kino of the quarantine...

00:20:14.292 --> 00:20:15.560
David Boder: What is a Kino? [The word appeard far out of context, hence the question.]

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.707
Samuel Isakovitch: There was a Kino...

00:20:16.707 --> 00:20:16.948
David Boder: Hm.

00:20:16.948 --> 00:20:18.233
Samuel Isakovitch: in the quarantine...

00:20:18.233 --> 00:20:18.374
David Boder: Hm.

00:20:18.374 --> 00:20:21.302
Samuel Isakovitch: ...there in Buchenwald...and...

00:20:21.302 --> 00:20:22.992
David Boder: What did you call a Kino?

00:20:22.992 --> 00:20:27.066
Samuel Isakovitch: It was a Kino. There they dispensed the food...there was a Kino.

00:20:27.066 --> 00:20:29.451
David Boder: Oh, a Kino, a theater. [Footnote: The Kino was a large auditorium that had been used to show movies for the old-time political prisoners. It was located in the small lager called the ‘Quarantine’. At the time of Isakovitch’s arrival, the small lager was overcrowded and the movie house was used for dispensing the food rations to the newly arrived prisoners. B.W.]

00:20:29.451 --> 00:20:31.594
Samuel Isakovitch: A theater...a barrack...

00:20:31.594 --> 00:20:31.986
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:31.986 --> 00:20:42.127
Samuel Isakovitch: ...but it was only called so...and there was no food to be given to the people so they took them into the movie house... a line was formed in the morning from the appell square.

00:20:42.127 --> 00:20:42.550
David Boder: Hm.

00:20:42.550 --> 00:21:03.197
Samuel Isakovitch: ...and till the evening...till ten o’clock...till everybody finished their food. One person doled out the food. We received once a day a piece of bread with a little soup. A hundred seventeen...a hundred and seventy grams of bread and a little piece of margarine and a half liter of soup.

00:21:03.197 --> 00:21:05.581
David Boder: Did one work in Buchenwald?

00:21:05.581 --> 00:21:07.694
Samuel Isakovitch: One worked in the stone-quarry.

00:21:07.694 --> 00:21:09.263
David Boder: What did they...

00:21:09.263 --> 00:21:10.983
Samuel Isakovitch: In the stone-quarries we worked.

00:21:10.983 --> 00:21:13.397
David Boder: What did one do? Carried out the stones?

00:21:13.397 --> 00:21:19.463
Samuel Isakovitch: Carried out the stones. We have...with the carts...with the wagons they were carried away...

00:21:19.463 --> 00:21:19.994
David Boder: Hm.

00:21:19.994 --> 00:21:30.044
Samuel Isakovitch: Every day there remained in the stone quarry...every day ten, fifteen people...they were dead...they were murdered...in the quarry.

00:21:30.044 --> 00:21:30.738
David Boder: By whom?

00:21:30.738 --> 00:21:35.627
Samuel Isakovitch: The SS men...they couldn’t work; they were murdered in the quarries.

00:21:35.627 --> 00:21:36.714
David Boder: What, they were shot?

00:21:36.714 --> 00:21:44.199
Samuel Isakovitch: They were shot...if once it was said that one was of no use [no good], he was given a bullet in the head and left lying there.

00:21:44.199 --> 00:21:45.618
David Boder: And the...the others stood by?

00:21:45.618 --> 00:21:47.489
Samuel Isakovitch: And the others...were close by. Everybody was close by.

00:21:47.489 --> 00:21:50.145
David Boder: Did you see it yourself?

00:21:50.145 --> 00:21:54.401
Samuel Isakovitch: Sure. Everything I saw...we were there all together.

00:21:54.401 --> 00:21:59.803
David Boder: Tell me, but there were in Buchenwald...in Buchenwald others —there were Germans too...and...

00:21:59.803 --> 00:22:18.862
Samuel Isakovitch: Yes. Yes. But they were already old prisoners...they were the old criminals...they had been there already for fifteen, sixteen years [Footnote: His statements are somewhat confused as to time.]...old criminals...and bandits...and they were the capos and the block elders... They did everything...they even made...we were simple prisoners...we had just arrived from the other lagers.

00:22:18.862 --> 00:22:20.492
David Boder: What do you mean by capos?

00:22:20.492 --> 00:22:23.963
Samuel Isakovitch: Capos were the overseers at work...

00:22:23.963 --> 00:22:26.860
David Boder: Hm. And they were what? Old criminals?

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:37.960
Samuel Isakovitch: They were old criminals...and bandits...and people who had committed sabotage. They had been in for fifteen, sixteen years...[?][Footnote: His statements are somewhat confused as to time.] political prisoners who were already for fifteen, sixteen years in the lager.

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:38.533
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:38.533 --> 00:23:01.368
Samuel Isakovitch: In concentration camps...they were the leaders. They murdered so. Much more than the SS men, than the ‘real’ Germans. And the SS men who were in reality Ukranians, Polacks, Magyars...the Magyars were even worse than the others. They were the Gestapo men with the black...

00:23:01.368 --> 00:23:02.847
David Boder: They were much worse?

00:23:02.847 --> 00:23:04.718
Samuel Isakovitch: Much worse than the Germans.

00:23:04.718 --> 00:23:07.947
David Boder: Hm. And that was in Buchenwald.

00:23:07.947 --> 00:23:08.128
Samuel Isakovitch: Yes.

00:23:08.128 --> 00:23:09.818
David Boder: And where were you liberated?

00:23:09.818 --> 00:23:10.965
Samuel Isakovitch: In Buchenwald.

00:23:10.965 --> 00:23:12.172
David Boder: Who liberated you?

00:23:12.172 --> 00:23:13.349
Samuel Isakovitch: The Americans.

00:23:13.349 --> 00:23:17.967
David Boder: Nu, tell me, what happened a few days before the liberation and [then] after?

00:23:17.967 --> 00:23:28.953
Samuel Isakovitch: Before the liberation...they took...when the Americans came...they took...we were sixty-five thousand men on the appell square. They started...First of all, was, ‘Jews, step forward.’ It was...

00:23:28.953 --> 00:23:30.040
David Boder: The Americans said that?

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.579
Samuel Isakovitch: No! The Germans.

00:23:31.579 --> 00:23:31.941
David Boder: Yes?

00:23:31.941 --> 00:23:43.146
Samuel Isakovitch: Before the Americans entered. It was ‘Jews, step forward.’ Then the Jews already knew exactly from other concentration camps what was going on. Then they began to dodge it.

00:23:43.146 --> 00:23:43.689
David Boder: The Jews?

00:23:43.689 --> 00:23:50.570
Samuel Isakovitch: The Jews. They took, the old criminals and bandits, they began to throw out from the blocks...

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:51.355
David Boder: Whom?

00:23:51.355 --> 00:23:52.351
Samuel Isakovitch: The Jews.

00:23:52.351 --> 00:23:52.592
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:52.592 --> 00:23:53.508
Samuel Isakovitch: ...the prisoners...

00:23:53.508 --> 00:23:53.880
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:24:01.411
Samuel Isakovitch: ...and the Jews...it was, ‘Get out.’ And he was immediately grabbed and taken to the D.K.V., and from the D.K.V. they never came out[Footnote: These were factories which had been bombed by the Americans at the end of 1944 and now were empty. To these buildings the Jews were taken. During the appell in the morning, the loudspeaker suddenly blared out, ‘Jews, fall out and line up to one side!’ Many started to run, I among them. I escaped fromm the appell square back to my original block and hid under a bunk. The others, those who remained on the appell square, were deported, destination unknown. B.W.].

00:24:01.411 --> 00:24:02.347
David Boder: The Jews were taken away?

00:24:02.347 --> 00:24:03.886
Samuel Isakovitch: Yes, the Jews.

00:24:03.886 --> 00:24:04.248
David Boder: Nu?

00:24:04.248 --> 00:24:08.986
Samuel Isakovitch: And when I saw what is going on, I immediately reported [hid] among the Frenchmen...

00:24:08.986 --> 00:24:09.500
David Boder: Hm.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:18.947
Samuel Isakovitch: ...and...I knew no French. But the first who got out, these remained, and the others, these were taken right away and they remained there.

00:24:18.947 --> 00:24:19.158
David Boder: Hm.

00:24:19.158 --> 00:24:35.488
Samuel Isakovitch: And these were...they went between the...between...there in the D.K.V., and they were shot and murdered...and then they, youngsters up to eighteen years, were taken into a youth block, block 66...

00:24:35.488 --> 00:24:35.790
David Boder: Yes?

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:43.124
Samuel Isakovitch: ...in the quarantine, and we awaited...we had a very good man for a blokovy [Barrack chief in Polish] a Czech, a political prisoner...

00:24:43.124 --> 00:24:43.426
David Boder: Yes?

00:24:43.426 --> 00:25:02.111
Samuel Isakovitch: He was the block elder. He was...he worked for us, for the youngsters, so that we could remain alive. And so we awaited the Americans. And before the Americans came there, already [many] had left...there remained nineteen thousand prisoners, in Buchenwald.

00:25:02.111 --> 00:25:03.077
David Boder: Yes...and the others?

00:25:03.077 --> 00:25:14.955
Samuel Isakovitch: The others...the others have...no one knows whether they were shot, or...a stone was put up that fifty-nine thousand shot, murd-...murdered prisoners from among us.

00:25:14.955 --> 00:25:15.619
David Boder: In Buchenwald?

00:25:15.619 --> 00:25:16.192
Samuel Isakovitch: In Buchenwald.

00:25:16.192 --> 00:25:24.794
David Boder: Wait, so...when...before the Americans came did the SS leave, or what?

00:25:24.794 --> 00:25:34.271
Samuel Isakovitch: They left. Immediately. They left right away. They were caught. It was the...our...the prisoners of war, the Russians.

00:25:34.271 --> 00:25:34.543
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:34.543 --> 00:25:42.450
Samuel Isakovitch: They immediately captured the weapons. They were still healthy and the Americans came from below, from the village...

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:42.752
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:42.752 --> 00:25:55.194
Samuel Isakovitch: They were held by the Americans from one side and the prisoners of war from the other side. They were immediately gathered together...they were captured, and after that we don’t know what the Americans did with them.

00:25:55.194 --> 00:25:58.484
David Boder: They weren’t...they weren’t punished?

00:25:58.484 --> 00:26:03.486
Samuel Isakovitch: No, no, not punished. They were only taken away. Where, we don’t know.

00:26:03.486 --> 00:26:04.522
David Boder: The SS were taken away?

00:26:04.522 --> 00:26:05.649
Samuel Isakovitch: Yes.

00:26:05.649 --> 00:26:08.909
David Boder: All right. And then who remained in...in...

00:26:08.909 --> 00:26:17.179
Samuel Isakovitch: All of us remained in the lager, half...half-dead. And there came the Americans Red Cross machines...

00:26:17.179 --> 00:26:17.420
David Boder: Yes.

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:24.181
Samuel Isakovitch: ...in automobiles. It began...took us out to the...led us into the SS barracks,

00:26:24.181 --> 00:26:24.453
David Boder: Hm.

00:26:24.453 --> 00:26:33.457
Samuel Isakovitch: ...and there we recuperated a little...We were asked where everyone wants to go...We took and went to Italy...

00:26:33.457 --> 00:26:34.845
David Boder: You left for Italy?

00:26:34.845 --> 00:26:35.237
Samuel Isakovitch: Yes.

00:26:35.237 --> 00:26:38.104
David Boder: Why did you decide to go to Italy?

00:26:38.104 --> 00:26:40.971
Samuel Isakovitch: The Americans took us there to convalesce.

00:26:40.971 --> 00:26:42.631
David Boder: Oh, the Americans took you to convalesce.

00:26:42.631 --> 00:26:42.782
Samuel Isakovitch: ...to convalesce...

00:26:42.782 --> 00:26:43.808
David Boder: to convalesce in Italy?

00:26:43.808 --> 00:26:44.412
Samuel Isakovitch: ...in Italy.

00:26:44.412 --> 00:26:45.770
David Boder: Where did they take you?

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:51.474
Samuel Isakovitch: They took us from Buchenwald and we went to Milan, and from Milan we went to Turin.

00:26:51.474 --> 00:26:51.897
David Boder: To Turin.

00:26:51.897 --> 00:26:52.259
Samuel Isakovitch: Yes.

00:26:52.259 --> 00:26:54.553
David Boder: And who gave you to eat there?

00:26:54.553 --> 00:26:59.322
Samuel Isakovitch: The Americans. The Americans units [?].

00:26:59.322 --> 00:27:01.344
David Boder: The Americans organizations?

00:27:01.344 --> 00:27:01.917
Samuel Isakovitch: Yes.

00:27:01.917 --> 00:27:04.271
David Boder: And how long were you in Turin?

00:27:04.271 --> 00:27:06.263
Samuel Isakovitch: I was there four months.

00:27:06.263 --> 00:27:08.255
David Boder: And from there where did you go?

00:27:08.255 --> 00:27:09.975
Samuel Isakovitch: I came straight here, to Paris.

00:27:09.975 --> 00:27:12.842
David Boder: Why did you come to Paris?

00:27:12.842 --> 00:27:20.085
Samuel Isakovitch: I came here to Paris in order to...I want to learn a trade... I saw in Turin one can’t learn anything, and...

00:27:20.085 --> 00:27:21.805
David Boder: Is there no ORT in Turin?

00:27:21.805 --> 00:27:25.457
Samuel Isakovitch: There is an ORT. There is a camp, a lager...

00:27:25.457 --> 00:27:25.759
David Boder: Yes?

00:27:25.759 --> 00:27:31.493
Samuel Isakovitch: ...but there is nothing else to learn. The Italians themselves don’t have...

00:27:31.493 --> 00:27:31.976
David Boder: Hm.

00:27:31.976 --> 00:27:33.727
Samuel Isakovitch: ...and we wanted to learn something...

00:27:33.727 --> 00:27:34.119
David Boder: Hm.

00:27:34.119 --> 00:27:38.918
Samuel Isakovitch: Now we are young, we have to learn something...

00:27:38.918 --> 00:27:39.401
David Boder: Hm.

00:27:39.401 --> 00:27:40.095
Samuel Isakovitch: ...so we came to Paris.

00:27:40.095 --> 00:27:44.441
David Boder: Nu, did you find out anything about your relatives, your family?

00:27:44.441 --> 00:27:50.085
Samuel Isakovitch: Till now I found nobody. I know of nobody...

00:27:50.085 --> 00:27:57.872
David Boder: Tell me, Moskovsky says that you were taken away to the same camp with his father.

00:27:57.872 --> 00:27:58.385
Samuel Isakovitch: Yes.

00:27:58.385 --> 00:28:00.166
David Boder: What happened to him?

00:28:00.166 --> 00:28:33.022
Samuel Isakovitch: About him I don’t kn-...nothing is known...I left with the youth block and he left...he wasn’t in the youth block. He was in the prisoner’s block where the other old people were. And there was a youth block and we were taken separately, in separate RR-cars, and he went separately...afterwards we didn’t see anybody from Auschwitz...we didn’t see him there any more. We left from Gleiwitz, from Gleiwitz l. We were put into RR-cars and I saw him no more. But I heard that he was taken away to Dora, and I went to...

00:28:33.022 --> 00:28:34.501
David Boder: Where is Dora?

00:28:34.501 --> 00:28:39.753
Samuel Isakovitch: To Dora he went, to Germany, the father of Moskovitz...his father...

00:28:39.753 --> 00:28:41.172
David Boder: Is Dora a town in Germany?

00:28:41.172 --> 00:28:41.987
Samuel Isakovitch: A town.

00:28:41.987 --> 00:28:44.341
David Boder: Yes, and what was there, a lager?

00:29:27.559 --> 00:29:32.690
Samuel Isakovitch: In the evening we learn French, and we learn English, whoever wants to.

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:35.587
David Boder: Have all these young people been in concentration camps?

00:29:35.587 --> 00:29:38.816
Samuel Isakovitch: They have been. All have been in concentration camps.

00:29:38.816 --> 00:29:49.983

Samuel Isakovitch: I don’t know myself what to do...

00:30:11.714 --> 00:30:13.736
David Boder: But for the time being you are here?

00:30:13.736 --> 00:30:15.879
Samuel Isakovitch: For the time being I am here in the home [?].

00:30:15.879 --> 00:30:17.177

00:30:48.128 --> 00:31:10.359
David Boder: [In German] Mr. Isakovitch, I have here a few pictures, and I want that you should tell me which of your experience of the last few years, do these pictures remind you of. [Aside:] This is #8. Hold it. Nu? What is this picture about? What does it remind you of?

00:31:10.359 --> 00:31:11.868
Samuel Isakovitch: That is...

00:31:11.868 --> 00:31:13.226
David Boder: Make some kind of story out of it.

00:31:13.226 --> 00:31:33.933
Samuel Isakovitch: This one...one of the women — prisoners who...they look like the women-prisoners who were in the lagers, who were ragged, in tatters...they are famished...they are emaciated...they have no...they are thinking when the liberation will come.

00:31:33.933 --> 00:31:34.537
David Boder: Hm.

00:31:34.537 --> 00:31:36.982

00:31:37.706 --> 00:31:39.426
Samuel Isakovitch: ...famished.

00:31:39.426 --> 00:31:45.191
David Boder: And what is this? [Aside: #9.]

00:31:45.191 --> 00:31:52.193
Samuel Isakovitch: This...so...the capo or the blokowy...[Polish for block-trusty]...the blokova [women block-trusty]sends the woman...

00:31:52.193 --> 00:31:52.616
David Boder: Yes.

00:31:52.616 --> 00:32:01.459
Samuel Isakovitch: ...and drives to work...and makes with her...she should work...she should do everything.

00:32:01.459 --> 00:32:02.183
David Boder: Hm.

00:32:02.183 --> 00:32:05.292
Samuel Isakovitch: ..all kind of hard things...

00:32:05.292 --> 00:32:13.713
David Boder: And...#12.M. And what is this?

00:32:13.713 --> 00:32:46.749
Samuel Isakovitch: These are...the prisoners...they were taken to the lager. hey were looked over like this and...if one was sick, or what...they were taken and looked over if he still alive, or what...he lay there — the comrade. He saw that he lay so on the bed. He took him...he tested him with the hands if he is still alive...he should stay alive, or what...and he was already dead...he was thrown out on the heap [of bodies?].

00:32:46.749 --> 00:32:52.393
David Boder: And what do you think is this? [Aside: #15.] Yes?

00:32:52.393 --> 00:33:03.439
Samuel Isakovitch: It is also a prisoner...a ‘Mussulman,’ who...simply a ‘Mussulman,’ He can’t walk any more to work...

00:33:03.439 --> 00:33:05.031
David Boder: What is a ‘Mussulman’?

00:33:05.031 --> 00:33:24.617
Samuel Isakovitch: A ‘Mussulman’...who is quite emaciated and he can’t walk, he can’t talk...he is completely emaciated...worked out, used up, who can’t do anything any more. Then he becomes emaciated. Then he is a finished ‘Mussulman.’[Footnote: His description of a so-called mussulman is perefect. The origin of this nickname is not known. See the book by Odd Nansen: From Day to Day.]

00:33:24.617 --> 00:33:26.337
David Boder: What was done with the Mussulmen?

00:33:26.337 --> 00:33:29.989

00:33:29.989 --> 00:33:30.400

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:34.444
Samuel Isakovitch: In Birkenau they were taken into the gas-chambers. Gassed.

00:33:34.444 --> 00:33:36.406
David Boder: What is this? [Card number not recorded.]

00:33:36.406 --> 00:33:46.939
Samuel Isakovitch: It could be some youth...it could be some youth from the ghetto or from somewhere...after the liberation.

00:33:46.939 --> 00:33:50.048
David Boder: And what is this? [Card number not recorded.]

00:33:50.048 --> 00:33:52.161
Samuel Isakovitch: This is work...

00:33:52.161 --> 00:33:52.614
David Boder: Yes?

00:33:52.614 --> 00:34:01.003
Samuel Isakovitch: It is at work [some words not clear]...working in the fields...

00:34:01.003 --> 00:34:13.558
David Boder: Oh. Yes. Tell me, what is the most terrible story that you remember from the concentration camp?

00:34:13.558 --> 00:34:26.101
Samuel Isakovitch: The most terrible...eh...it was when we came to Birkenau and they took the children with the women and they started to throw them into the fire, this was the most terrible...

00:34:26.101 --> 00:34:27.077
David Boder: Did you see it yourself?

00:34:27.077 --> 00:34:28.853
Samuel Isakovitch: I saw it with my [own] eyes.

00:34:28.853 --> 00:34:30.815
David Boder: What do you mean, in the fire? Before the gas?

00:34:30.815 --> 00:34:39.960
Samuel Isakovitch: Before the gas. Before everything. They took the dogs and with machine-guns they shot at the children and women...they were taken and thrown into the fire...

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.397
David Boder: What kind of a fire did they have?

00:34:41.397 --> 00:35:09.766
Samuel Isakovitch: A fire that was a pit and since many couldn’t be burned in the crematories, so a pit was made in Birkenau...a pit was made. On the bottom burned oil and coke and other such that burns, and there they took and threw in the people. They threw themselves in. They already saw it does not make any difference any more...they were thrown in so long...between the wires...pushed in so long...so long until they themselves had to jump into the fire...[long means continuously].

00:35:09.766 --> 00:35:11.124
David Boder: What kind of wires?

00:35:11.124 --> 00:35:16.285
Samuel Isakovitch: Between the electrical wires [the electrified fence]. The electric wires came right to the...near the pit.

00:35:16.285 --> 00:35:16.852
David Boder: Yes?

00:35:16.852 --> 00:35:26.971
Samuel Isakovitch: They were pushed so long toward the pit...with the dogs and machine guns....for so long till they came so near that they had to jump by themselves into the fire. And then...

00:35:26.971 --> 00:35:28.631
David Boder: I don’t understand. Where were the electrified wires?

00:35:28.631 --> 00:35:31.408
Samuel Isakovitch: I will show you. Here was the pit, yes?

00:35:31.408 --> 00:35:31.680
David Boder: Yes.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:33.944
Samuel Isakovitch: ...and here came the electrified wires...

00:35:33.944 --> 00:35:34.245
David Boder: Yes.

00:35:34.245 --> 00:35:36.237
Samuel Isakovitch: ...thus. And here the people were driven...

00:35:36.237 --> 00:35:36.569
David Boder: Yes.

00:35:36.569 --> 00:35:44.084
Samuel Isakovitch: Here was the fire. When the people came from this side, they then had no way out. Here they couldn’t. Here were the electrified wires...

00:35:44.084 --> 00:35:44.808
David Boder: Yes.

00:35:44.808 --> 00:35:48.299
Samuel Isakovitch: If they touched the electrified fence they were right away ‘kaput.’ [This adjective normally means the complete breakdown of inanimate objects, predominantly mechanisms such as clocks or machinery.]

00:35:48.299 --> 00:35:48.369
David Boder: Yes.

00:35:48.369 --> 00:35:52.625
Samuel Isakovitch: ...went ‘kaput.’ And here they couldn’t but go into the fire. And here they were driven into...

00:35:52.625 --> 00:35:52.866
David Boder: Hm.

00:35:52.866 --> 00:35:55.140
Samuel Isakovitch: ...with machine guns, with dogs, with...

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:55.955
David Boder: With blookhounds?

00:35:55.955 --> 00:35:59.939
Samuel Isakovitch: Blood-hounds. The big dogs that the SS men had.

00:35:59.939 --> 00:36:04.013
David Boder: Hm. Anyone from the family had been there?

00:36:04.013 --> 00:36:10.381
Samuel Isakovitch: Everbody was there who...I have no means of knowing...I didn’t see...I only saw people...people are being led...such screams that...

00:36:10.381 --> 00:36:12.675
David Boder: And where did the men stand?

00:36:12.675 --> 00:36:31.894
Samuel Isakovitch: Everybody fell...everbody went in...and the men worked at it...worked...he was shot...he who didn’t want to enter, he was shot; he also had to be thrown in...at that time was full the whole...the whole court-yard of Birkenau was filled with...with dead.

00:36:31.894 --> 00:36:33.765
David Boder: When was that, in what year?

00:36:33.765 --> 00:36:35.787
Samuel Isakovitch: That was in the year forty-four.

00:36:35.787 --> 00:36:37.387
David Boder: In what month?

00:36:37.387 --> 00:36:41.824
Samuel Isakovitch: May...May on the...May, on the eighteenth of May...

00:36:41.824 --> 00:36:42.760
David Boder: Approximately.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:49.883
Samuel Isakovitch: Approximately. [Long pause.]

00:36:49.883 --> 00:36:53.988
David Boder: What do you think should be done with Germany now?

00:36:53.988 --> 00:37:18.708
Samuel Isakovitch: What should be done? I can’t say anything. If there are no bigger heads [smarter people] who should that...who should do something, then I can’t say anything what...they didn’t...they had already visited the camps, they can...nobody can say it...such youth who remained without parents, without...and who have nobody...who can say anything?

00:37:18.708 --> 00:37:38.808
David Boder: [In English] Yes. This was the supplement to the same spool of the young Samuel Isakovitch. Spool#7.
