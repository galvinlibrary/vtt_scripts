00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:48.767
David Boder: [In English] Munich, September the 20th, 1946 [exactly ten years ago at the time of translation], at the transient UNRRA camp at the Funkenkasernen. The interviewee is Miss...eh, is Mrs. Doctor Charlotte Schultze, 47 years old, and she is a [words not clear]. She is an Aryan, married to a Aryan physician who was here during the war, because they...for various reasons we will hear. And her husband and eleven year old son are already across, and she is expecting now, from week to week, her affidavits to go over to the United States.

00:00:48.767 --> 00:00:52.169
David Boder: [In German] Now, Frau doctor. [Whispers] You want to talk English, true?

00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:53.833
Charlotte Schultze: No, German.

00:00:53.833 --> 00:00:54.826
David Boder: You want to talk German.

00:00:54.826 --> 00:00:55.497
Charlotte Schultze: Yes [?].

00:00:55.497 --> 00:01:06.434
David Boder: Well, yes. Come a bit nearer so you won’t have to talk too loud. Make yourself comfortable. [A few words more in whispers, not clear.] Now Frau doctor, will you please tell me again what is your name and where were you born?

00:01:06.434 --> 00:01:11.928
Charlotte Schultze: Charlotte Schultze, from Dresden, born in Dresden, 1899.

00:01:11.928 --> 00:01:16.001
David Boder: Yes. And who were your parents, Mrs. Shultze?

00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:18.791
Charlotte Schultze: Director Bruno Zomack and...

00:01:18.791 --> 00:01:20.672
David Boder: You are born [your maiden name is] what? Zomack?

00:01:20.672 --> 00:01:21.423
Charlotte Schultze: Zomack, yes.

00:01:21.423 --> 00:01:24.469
David Boder: And who...What was the occupation of your parents?

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:26.286
Charlotte Schultze: Well, my father was the director of a factory [hence his title].

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:27.279
David Boder: Yes. A bit nearer [to the microphone].

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.871
Charlotte Schultze: Yes.

00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:37.610
David Boder: And...now tell me please, where were you...where were you when the war started?

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:48.000
Charlotte Schultze: When the war started we were in Dresden. And we could not go back [to the United States], because my son of [my] first marriage was a German, and was not permitted any more to leave the country.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.381
David Boder: Aha.

00:01:48.381 --> 00:01:49.985
Charlotte Schultze: Because he was able to work.

00:01:49.985 --> 00:01:53.663
David Boder: Now, would they not have let you go across alone? Permitted you to go?

00:01:53.663 --> 00:01:57.412
Charlotte Schultze: I would have been permitted to go across, but I did not want to leave my son alone. No?

00:01:57.412 --> 00:02:02.001
David Boder: You did not want to leave your son alone. And did your husband agree to it?

00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:05.537
Charlotte Schultze: Oh, yes. I am not [word not clear; she apparently weeps].

00:02:05.537 --> 00:02:13.292
David Boder: Now then, tell me please, how long...I understand that you have lived already once in America?

00:02:13.292 --> 00:02:13.861
Charlotte Schultze: Yes.

00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:16.158
David Boder: So when did you return to Germany?

00:02:16.158 --> 00:02:26.606
Charlotte Schultze: In 1934, because my mother had died, and my father was nostalgic for us, and we then expected our little boy, and [chuckle]...

00:02:26.606 --> 00:02:26.967
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:26.967 --> 00:02:30.028
Charlotte Schultze: . . . the grandparents wanted to live to see him [chuckle], no?

00:02:30.028 --> 00:02:33.072
David Boder: Yes. And so you returned with your husband?

00:02:33.072 --> 00:02:33.895
Charlotte Schultze: Yes.

00:02:33.895 --> 00:02:36.654
David Boder: Where did your Herr Doctor Schultze study?

00:02:36.654 --> 00:02:38.040
Charlotte Schultze: In Leipzig...doctor.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.124
David Boder: He has studied medicine in Leipzig?

00:02:40.124 --> 00:02:40.929
Charlotte Schultze: Yes, yes.

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:45.359
David Boder: Yes. Now, so you all returned.

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:46.644
Charlotte Schultze: We all returned, yes.

00:02:46.644 --> 00:02:49.457
David Boder: Did you leave anything behind in America?

00:02:49.457 --> 00:02:52.270
Charlotte Schultze: Well, we had [chuckle]...

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.725
David Boder: Did you have any property?

00:02:53.725 --> 00:02:55.241
Charlotte Schultze: Yes, we left property behind.

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:57.521
David Boder: Where did you leave it? In Milwaukee?

00:02:57.521 --> 00:02:58.575
Charlotte Schultze: Yes, in New York.

00:02:58.575 --> 00:02:58.722
David Boder: What?

00:02:58.722 --> 00:03:02.050
Charlotte Schultze: My husband had a life insurance there.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.964
David Boder: Aha. Was he able to keep up this life insurance all this time?

00:03:05.964 --> 00:03:10.335
Charlotte Schultze: No. That went on...on through loans. It...

00:03:10.335 --> 00:03:13.947
David Boder: Oh, it was possible through a loan on the insurance...

00:03:13.947 --> 00:03:14.427
Charlotte Schultze: To maintain it further in force.

00:03:14.427 --> 00:03:14.805
David Boder: . . . to continue paying for it.

00:03:14.805 --> 00:03:16.854
Charlotte Schultze: Maintain it in force.

00:03:16.854 --> 00:03:22.456
David Boder: Yes. And you came here. And did your husband resume again the practice of medicine?

00:03:22.456 --> 00:03:27.863
Charlotte Schultze: First he attended courses, true? That is what we had really come for.

00:03:27.863 --> 00:03:28.544
David Boder: Hm.

00:03:28.544 --> 00:03:31.605
Charlotte Schultze: But then we were detained here by the illness of his father...

00:03:31.605 --> 00:03:32.210
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:40.833
Charlotte Schultze: . . . who had to go through an eye...a difficult eye operation, and due to that we at first could not return.

00:03:40.833 --> 00:03:44.290
David Boder: What is the doctor’s speciality? Did he have any?

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.893
Charlotte Schultze: No. He practiced...

00:03:44.893 --> 00:03:45.866
David Boder: General...general practice.

00:03:45.866 --> 00:03:47.889
Charlotte Schultze: In general, a practicing physician.

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:55.546
David Boder: Now would you please tell me what happened when...when the war started?

00:03:55.546 --> 00:03:57.750
Charlotte Schultze: Yes. We remained here then, and...

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.647
David Boder: You lived in Dresden?

00:03:58.647 --> 00:04:03.660
Charlotte Schultze: We lived in Dresden. My husband practiced, and...

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:10.266
David Boder: You told me before that something happened with your boy, with your older boy? Will you please tell me about it.

00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:41.038
Charlotte Schultze: Yes. My son was then the only one at school who did not belong to the Hitler Youth, and since my husband treated many Jewish patients, so he [the son] had a friend who was a Jew, and due to that we had a lot of trouble. And at the end of the first year of war he attempted to cross the Swiss border with his friend in order to open the road for us [to make it possible for us] to return to America, because he knew that he was...

00:04:41.038 --> 00:04:41.536
David Boder: The obstacle.

00:04:41.536 --> 00:04:43.265
Charlotte Schultze: . . . the obstacle. No?

00:04:43.265 --> 00:04:43.916
David Boder: Yes.

00:04:43.916 --> 00:04:54.247
Charlotte Schultze: But he was arrested at the Swiss border. He was thrown in jail for three months. Then I fetched them both in Bregenz.

00:04:54.247 --> 00:04:55.273
David Boder: Hm.

00:04:55.273 --> 00:04:59.324
Charlotte Schultze: And from then on we were more or less under the surveillance of the Gestapo.

00:04:59.324 --> 00:05:00.379
David Boder: Yes.

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:13.436
Charlotte Schultze: Then the boy went into the labor service. There he made a second attempt to leave the lager, but was again returned. Then he was drafted in 1941.

00:05:13.436 --> 00:05:14.087
David Boder: As a soldier?

00:05:14.087 --> 00:05:25.516
Charlotte Schultze: So. And he was so unhappy there. He believed [felt] he could not serve such a cause.

00:05:25.516 --> 00:05:26.456
David Boder: So.

00:05:26.456 --> 00:05:46.011
Charlotte Schultze: At any rate, in 1941, he again left his platoon, attempted to cross the Italian border, because an American clergyman who was there, the minister of the church with whom he was very friendly, of whom he knew that he was serving in the church of the embassy, a certain clergyman by the name [name not clear] Wolf...

00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:46.969
David Boder: Hm.

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:48.454
Charlotte Schultze: . . . from Elmira.

00:05:48.454 --> 00:05:49.997
David Boder: He was an American clergyman?

00:05:49.997 --> 00:05:51.117
Charlotte Schultze: An American clergyman?

00:05:51.117 --> 00:05:52.254
David Boder: From Elmira, New Jersey.

00:05:52.254 --> 00:05:55.772
Charlotte Schultze: Yes, with whom he was very, very friendly.

00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:57.066
David Boder: Yes. [Recollecting] Elmira, New York.

00:05:57.066 --> 00:05:57.350
Charlotte Schultze: Yes.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.505
David Boder: Nu, yes. And?

00:05:58.505 --> 00:06:03.543
Charlotte Schultze: And...now we assume that that was the reason that he went across the Italian border.

00:06:03.543 --> 00:06:04.454
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:04.454 --> 00:06:14.420
Charlotte Schultze: Now from there on we don’t know anything more. At any rate the Gestapo brought us his things, and asserted that he had shot himself.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.336
David Boder: Oh. The Gestapo brought you his things.

00:06:16.336 --> 00:06:19.406
Charlotte Schultze: Yes. But I still don’t know until this day...

00:06:19.406 --> 00:06:21.113
David Boder: Did he not leave a letter?

00:06:21.113 --> 00:06:23.556
Charlotte Schultze: Nothing. [Pause.]

00:06:23.556 --> 00:06:27.149
David Boder: Tell me, why did the Gestapo bother altogether to bring his things?

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:44.266
Charlotte Schultze: Hm. That we don’t know. At any rate, only after three weeks, after we had made inquiries [word not clear], only after more than three weeks, we got the first word just that he was dead, and that he was buried on Italian soil.

00:06:44.266 --> 00:06:45.294
David Boder: Oh, on Italian soil.

00:06:45.294 --> 00:06:45.891
Charlotte Schultze: Yes. Possibly...

00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:53.397
David Boder: Well, yes. At that time the Italians were already the allies of the Germans. True? It was Mussolini’s Italy.

00:06:53.397 --> 00:06:55.997
Charlotte Schultze: Yes.

00:06:55.997 --> 00:07:02.150
David Boder: Aha. Now tell me, you then...And your younger boy, how old was he?

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.019
Charlotte Schultze: The boy is now eleven years old.

00:07:04.019 --> 00:07:05.800
David Boder: Eleven years. This one was never in America?

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.147
Charlotte Schultze: No. We arrived here in October, and he was born in December.

00:07:11.147 --> 00:07:12.441
David Boder: He was born in December.

00:07:12.441 --> 00:07:13.143
Charlotte Schultze: Hm.

00:07:13.143 --> 00:07:16.022
David Boder: And what was the doctor doing here all the time?

00:07:16.022 --> 00:07:17.699
Charlotte Schultze: He practiced in Dresden.

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:19.092
David Boder: He practiced in Dresden as a physician.

00:07:19.092 --> 00:07:20.085
Charlotte Schultze: Practiced.

00:07:20.085 --> 00:07:22.145
David Boder: Could they not draft him?

00:07:22.145 --> 00:07:29.773
Charlotte Schultze: No. He maintained all the time his American citizenship. For that reason he did not get anything [any patients] assigned from the ‘sickness insurance’, and...

00:07:29.773 --> 00:07:30.380
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.759
Charlotte Schultze: Yes.

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:33.784
David Boder: He was born an American?

00:07:33.784 --> 00:07:34.956
Charlotte Schultze: He was born there. Yes.

00:07:34.956 --> 00:07:45.671
David Boder: Yes. A German, he would not have been permitted...Tell me, if a German would have become an American citizen, the Germans would not have recognized it?

00:07:45.671 --> 00:07:48.579
Charlotte Schultze: Yes. But he was naturalized [where?]. Although he was born there...

00:07:48.579 --> 00:07:48.705
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:48.705 --> 00:07:50.589
Charlotte Schultze: . . . he had returned as a child.

00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:50.888
David Boder: Yes?

00:07:50.888 --> 00:07:53.634
Charlotte Schultze: And then he became naturalized. [She is apparently confused.]

00:07:53.634 --> 00:07:54.565
David Boder: Again?

00:07:54.565 --> 00:07:55.065
Charlotte Schultze: Yes.

00:07:55.065 --> 00:07:55.427
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:55.427 --> 00:07:57.932
Charlotte Schultze: Because due to that he had lost his citizenship.

00:07:57.932 --> 00:08:00.949
David Boder: Because he had returned as a child?

00:08:00.949 --> 00:08:01.466
Charlotte Schultze: Please? [Pardon?]

00:08:01.466 --> 00:08:03.161
David Boder: Because he was returned as a child?

00:08:03.161 --> 00:08:03.666
Charlotte Schultze: Yes. Because...

00:08:03.666 --> 00:08:05.373
David Boder: He was brought back by his parents?

00:08:05.373 --> 00:08:06.120
Charlotte Schultze: Yes, yes.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:11.211
David Boder: Aha. So. Now tell me, you say you lived in Dresden.

00:08:11.211 --> 00:08:11.625
Charlotte Schultze: Yes.

00:08:11.625 --> 00:08:24.388
David Boder: How were things going on in Dresden? I heard so much from people who were in lagers. I have heard so little from people who were free.

00:08:24.388 --> 00:08:26.514
Charlotte Schultze: We had nothing. [Pause.]

00:08:26.514 --> 00:08:30.829
David Boder: How was life there?

00:08:30.829 --> 00:08:34.570
Charlotte Schultze: Well, for us personally, we just were not permitted to leave the city.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:35.346
David Boder: Why?

00:08:35.346 --> 00:08:36.834
Charlotte Schultze: On account of our citizenship.

00:08:36.834 --> 00:08:37.374
David Boder: Yes.

00:08:37.374 --> 00:08:45.068
Charlotte Schultze: True? Well, otherwise we were all under strict surveilance. [Chuckle.] Nobody could say what he wanted.

00:08:45.068 --> 00:08:47.758
David Boder: So, yes. Did you keep your radio?

00:08:47.758 --> 00:08:49.522
Charlotte Schultze: Yes, we were permitted to keep the radio.

00:08:49.522 --> 00:08:49.958
David Boder: You could keep it.

00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:55.997
Charlotte Schultze: We were just not permitted to listen to foreign transmitters. That means I used to do it, but I had a head-set. [Chuckle.]

00:08:55.997 --> 00:08:58.588
David Boder: Oh, you had ear...[phones].

00:08:58.588 --> 00:08:59.507
Charlotte Schultze: A head-set.

00:08:59.507 --> 00:09:05.253
David Boder: A head-set. And so you could more or less...Did you believe what the foreign transmitter...

00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:08.896
Charlotte Schultze: I could listen to it every evening, and for that reason we were oriented about everything.

00:09:08.896 --> 00:09:10.160
David Boder: Aha.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:27.717
Charlotte Schultze: And since my husband had very many Jewish patients we were also oriented about everything that was going on. He had a patient who came from Buchenwald, whose skull [scalp?] was completely battered up and so on. A certain doctor. A certain Doctor Magen...

00:09:27.717 --> 00:09:29.286
David Boder: Oh, a doctor who was in Buchenwald?

00:09:29.286 --> 00:09:29.804
Charlotte Schultze: Yes.

00:09:29.804 --> 00:09:32.154
David Boder: How come they let him out?

00:09:32.154 --> 00:09:37.555
Charlotte Schultze: Well, they locked him up for a short time, since he was the father of the boy with whom my son at times...

00:09:37.555 --> 00:09:38.021
David Boder: Has gone away.

00:09:38.021 --> 00:09:39.785
Charlotte Schultze: . . . had crossed the border.

00:09:39.785 --> 00:09:40.807
David Boder: Yes.

00:09:40.807 --> 00:09:59.729
Charlotte Schultze: This Herr Doctor Magen was then sent to Buchenwald, and then they set him free again. And a year later he was arrested again, and he was so unhappy [in such despair] that he took his own life in his cell. He tore his underwear and hanged himself.

00:09:59.729 --> 00:10:00.907
David Boder: That was that Doctor Magen.

00:10:00.907 --> 00:10:01.774
Charlotte Schultze: Yes.

00:10:01.774 --> 00:10:03.929
David Boder: And what happened to his son?

00:10:03.929 --> 00:10:13.084
Charlotte Schultze: And his son, too, attempted to reach again the Swiss border, but was caught and was put...

00:10:13.084 --> 00:10:14.124
David Boder: Did you...Yes.

00:10:14.124 --> 00:10:25.208
Charlotte Schultze: . . . into a concentration camp, and in a few weeks they sent to the mother and the daughter, who had still survived, the underwear with a notice that he had died.

00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:26.358
David Boder: Hm.

00:10:26.358 --> 00:10:35.880
Charlotte Schultze: And then the mother and daughter were taken to a barracks, and later on to Poland. Since then we never heard anything from both of them.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.592
David Boder: And the husband? He took his life...

00:10:37.592 --> 00:10:38.971
Charlotte Schultze: He took his life.

00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:40.114
David Boder: Where?

00:10:40.114 --> 00:10:46.360
Charlotte Schultze: In jail [?], still in prison, because he learned that he would be taken again to the concentration...concentration camp. No?

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:46.946
David Boder: Aha.

00:10:46.946 --> 00:10:49.955
Charlotte Schultze: The man was in such despair that he...[pause]

00:10:49.955 --> 00:10:57.197
David Boder: Tell me please, how was it in general with sui-...suicide? Were there many?

00:10:57.197 --> 00:11:09.081
Charlotte Schultze: [With deliberation] Well, about that I could not tell much. Among the Jewish people naturally very many, because my husband was often called to patients, and among them to a Frau Pick...

00:11:09.081 --> 00:11:09.252
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:18.449
Charlotte Schultze: . . . who lived not far from us, an old, very fine lady of 70 years. Mostly they took their lived with veronal.

00:11:18.449 --> 00:11:19.598
David Boder: With veronal, the sleep [remedy]...

00:11:19.598 --> 00:11:28.440
Charlotte Schultze: Yes, yes. My husband was also called to a Mr. Fisch at the time when there was a transport to Poland.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.099
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:29.099 --> 00:11:40.307
Charlotte Schultze: And the man was gravely ill and was supposed to be sent away that night to Poland. And so my husband personally called [telephoned] the Gestapo and...and...

00:11:40.307 --> 00:11:40.684
David Boder: Told [them].

00:11:40.684 --> 00:11:43.764
Charlotte Schultze: . . . reported that it was impossible that this man...

00:11:43.764 --> 00:11:44.204
David Boder: Be taken.

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:51.762
Charlotte Schultze: . . . be taken. No? So then only the sons were transported [sent away], because they were Poles, that is they were never in Poland.

00:11:51.762 --> 00:11:52.291
David Boder: Yes. [Just] Polish citizens...

00:11:52.291 --> 00:11:58.227
Charlotte Schultze: They were born in Germany, no? The people were then disembarked there at the border, and...[See Matzner, Chapter 10.]

00:11:58.227 --> 00:11:58.592
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:58.592 --> 00:12:02.049
Charlotte Schultze: . . . and nobody cared about them.

00:12:02.049 --> 00:12:06.509
David Boder: Now tell me. You also associated [were friends] with Germans, true?

00:12:06.509 --> 00:12:08.167
Charlotte Schultze: Yes.

00:12:08.167 --> 00:12:12.977
David Boder: And what was the German attitude toward the whole Hitler affair.

00:12:12.977 --> 00:12:17.620
Charlotte Schultze: Yes. We had, of course, the feeling that very, very few were for Hitler.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:18.324
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:18.324 --> 00:12:25.719
Charlotte Schultze: Because I knew that, from the practice of my husband, hardly one per cent were Nazis.

00:12:25.719 --> 00:12:26.373
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:26.373 --> 00:12:29.705
Charlotte Schultze: It is, of course, possible that these [chuckle] did not come to us.

00:12:29.705 --> 00:12:30.040
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:37.388
Charlotte Schultze: No? [Chuckle.] Because they knew first of all that my husband was an American, and secondly they knew our [political] orientation.

00:12:37.388 --> 00:12:44.342
David Boder: Hm. Now tell me, was it known what was going on in the concentration camps?

00:12:44.342 --> 00:12:47.753
Charlotte Schultze: Oh well. I think [to] the majority of people—no.

00:12:47.753 --> 00:12:48.320
David Boder: Hm. You believe the majority...

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.541
Charlotte Schultze: No, no, they did not know.

00:12:50.541 --> 00:12:50.698
David Boder: Now...

00:12:50.698 --> 00:12:51.280
Charlotte Schultze: If we...

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:51.524
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:51.524 --> 00:12:58.448
Charlotte Schultze: If we had not heard a great deal by accident from our patients, we, too, would not have know it.

00:12:58.448 --> 00:13:06.391
David Boder: Didn’t some Gestapo people come home and tell about it to their relatives?

00:13:06.391 --> 00:13:06.776
Charlotte Schultze: Yes. Well...

00:13:06.776 --> 00:13:08.888
David Boder: It is not possible to have covered it up so completely.

00:13:08.888 --> 00:13:14.308
Charlotte Schultze: That I don’t know. At any rate, everyone was threatened with punishment by death.

00:13:14.308 --> 00:13:15.863
David Boder: Every Gestapo man?

00:13:15.863 --> 00:13:27.220
Charlotte Schultze: [Words not clear.] Nobody could speak [openly]. One had to be so cautious. I, too, was often afraid when my husband would return late from his calls [chuckle]. That something might have happened to him [chuckle].

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.630
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:32.022
Charlotte Schultze: Because often he spoke too frankly.

00:13:32.022 --> 00:13:32.463
David Boder: Aha.

00:13:32.463 --> 00:13:45.908
Charlotte Schultze: It was...it was...everything was so frightfully dangerous. There across in America no one can from for himself any idea about it, how [heavily] we stood under control, and how the whole population lived.

00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:53.485
David Boder: Well. [Pause.] Tell me, did you retain your maids during the war?

00:13:53.485 --> 00:13:54.705
Charlotte Schultze: Yes, yes.

00:13:54.705 --> 00:14:02.312
David Boder: And what kind of a person was she? What, for example, did you learn from her? What kind of ideas did she express?

00:14:02.312 --> 00:14:20.148
Charlotte Schultze: Oh, I had a very nice girl from Finster...from the proximity of Finsterwalde, from a little village. The parents had a farm, and they were completely oriented against Hitler. So that in this manner we did not have to gag our lips.

00:14:20.148 --> 00:14:21.800
David Boder: It was not dangerous [?]?

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:47.386
Charlotte Schultze: No. We could speak very frankly, because her parents were oriented in the same manner as she. From this angle we were not in danger. I also had a cleaning woman who took care of the laundry and such things. Her husband was entirely against Hitler, as well as she. In this manner, of all our neighbors, all of our acquaintances, nobody was in favor of the system.

00:14:47.386 --> 00:14:53.528
David Boder: Now tell me, who then was for the system that it took on such [abrupt end of Spool 136B]...

00:14:53.528 --> 00:15:09.575
Herman Barnett: [In English] Spool 137 recording starts in about one minute. Spool 137 recording starts in about one minute. This is Herman Barnett.

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:43.720
David Boder: Spool 9-137A. The conclusion of interview with Miss Charlotte Schultze. Spool 9-137B will contain the interview with Jürgen Bassfreund—a part of it.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:16:08.544
David Boder: Munich, September the 20th, 1946 in a transient camp maintained by the UNRRA. The interviewee is Miss...Charlotte, Mrs. Charlotte Schultze, the wife pf a physician already in the United States and we have yet a short conclusion.

00:16:08.544 --> 00:16:24.999
David Boder: [In German] Now tell me, we were discussing again the Germans, let us say, what they knew about Hitler, the concentration camps, and the war. Now what did they think about the war?

00:16:24.999 --> 00:16:40.964
Charlotte Schultze: Now that is hard to tell. Everybody hoped that the war would be over soon...will come to an end, and everybody hoped near and far that the events that may come to be in case of Nazi victory, will fail to happen [the wire for the last sentence is not clear].

00:16:40.964 --> 00:16:41.853
David Boder: Hmm.

00:16:41.853 --> 00:16:48.068
Charlotte Schultze: As sad as it may sound I was really in most cases...

00:16:48.068 --> 00:16:54.417
David Boder: Did they not feel that Germany was attacked and must now defend itself?

00:16:54.417 --> 00:17:02.658
Charlotte Schultze: No. About that it was clear to everybody that Hitler was the one who attacked.

00:17:02.658 --> 00:17:22.596
David Boder: Nu. Tell me, if the mood was such, how can one explain the strength, the large number of SS [presumably volunteers], the large number of SA [volunteer Storm Troupers], the constant large rallies when Hitler was speaking, and so on?

00:17:22.596 --> 00:17:25.135
Charlotte Schultze: Well, the people were simply ordered to it [compelled to act that way].

00:17:25.135 --> 00:17:26.021
David Boder: For example, who?

00:17:26.021 --> 00:17:48.250
Charlotte Schultze: Well, all the schools had to come and had to yell. The Hitler Youth was ordered out, all the industries had to march as closed units, and had to yell heil Hitler. Nobody had, any more, his own will, except for some of the free [independent] professions.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.864
David Boder: And what free professions were those?

00:17:50.864 --> 00:17:58.622
Charlotte Schultze: Well, the lawyers and people who were not organized.

00:17:58.622 --> 00:18:16.574
David Boder: Now, what to you think...Now I want to ask you one more question. Is it, in your way of thinking, is it true that the Germans at present are actually not so badly off?

00:18:16.574 --> 00:18:21.944
Charlotte Schultze: Well, of course. In the American Zone we have...we can’t complain, after all.

00:18:21.944 --> 00:18:24.604
David Boder: You mean the German public in general?

00:18:24.604 --> 00:18:32.885
Charlotte Schultze: In general, because I think that the enemy is very decent towards us, in complete contrast to that which we were [how we behaved] in other countries.

00:18:32.885 --> 00:18:33.144
David Boder: Now...

00:18:33.144 --> 00:18:35.013
Charlotte Schultze: Because we have heard about countries...

00:18:35.013 --> 00:18:35.419
David Boder: Yes.

00:18:35.419 --> 00:18:48.297
Charlotte Schultze: . . . which nearly perished from starvation when our occupation was there, because everything was removed from other countries, while in our case there is still something left [last words not clear; chuckle].

00:18:48.297 --> 00:18:48.740
David Boder: Yes.

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:52.124
Charlotte Schultze: [Chuckle.] So we have to be very thankful.

00:18:52.124 --> 00:19:01.604
David Boder: Now tell me, how do you explain it, that the main value [of exchange] here consists of cigarettes? [Pause.] How does that come about?

00:19:01.604 --> 00:19:02.570
Charlotte Schultze: The...

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:10.122
David Boder: Do people have really such a strong desire to smoke that they are willing to give so much [in return] for cigarettes?

00:19:10.122 --> 00:19:13.842
Charlotte Schultze: Now about that I can hardly speak, because I myself do not smoke. And so I...

00:19:13.842 --> 00:19:23.813
David Boder: Well, yes. But, for example, one pays off a porter with two cigarettes [the porters at the railroad stations as well as the other services were all on fixed salaries]. One gives the waitress a tip of two cigarettes. What do they do with them?

00:19:23.813 --> 00:19:26.097
Charlotte Schultze: She apparently sells them on the black market.

00:19:26.097 --> 00:19:29.307
David Boder: Who buys them.

00:19:29.307 --> 00:19:31.567
Charlotte Schultze: [Chuckle.] That I don’t know. Not I. [Laughter.]

00:19:31.567 --> 00:19:37.959
David Boder: Well. Now tell me what can one barter out for two cigarettes.

00:19:37.959 --> 00:19:41.522
Charlotte Schultze: That I can hardly inform you about, because I just don’t [one almost feels that she is afraid that the interview may have some official purpose.]

00:19:41.522 --> 00:19:45.829
David Boder: Well, but you also get here [officially in the UNRRA camps] paid in cigarettes, and so on.

00:19:45.829 --> 00:19:49.020
Charlotte Schultze: Well, maybe they [words not clear].

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:55.605
David Boder: Yes, but they themselves [the DPs and German traders] do not want [to accept] any money. They can’t get anything for the money].

00:19:55.605 --> 00:19:58.199
Charlotte Schultze: [Whispers] Well, I don’t know that either.

00:19:58.199 --> 00:20:01.643
David Boder: Now well. Do the peasants barter for cigarettes?

00:20:01.643 --> 00:20:05.233
Charlotte Schultze: Surely they, too, because they are heavy smokers.

00:20:05.233 --> 00:20:07.787
David Boder: And they give quite a bit for them?

00:20:07.787 --> 00:20:13.940
Charlotte Schultze: They give a lot for them. I heard that someone paid 90 marks for a package of cigarettes [the official exchange, as far as I remember, was about 10 marks to the dollar, or less].

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:14.568
David Boder: 90 marks?

00:20:14.568 --> 00:20:15.378
Charlotte Schultze: 30 [?] marks.

00:20:15.378 --> 00:20:21.304
David Boder: Nu, yes. One pays in France about 150 to 175 franks [official exchange of 117 franks to the dollar].

00:20:21.304 --> 00:20:25.491
Charlotte Schultze: Hm. Well, that is something that most people would be unable to understand.

00:20:25.491 --> 00:20:35.611
David Boder: Hm. Now tell me something else. How do you explain that most of the Germans are so well dressed?

00:20:35.611 --> 00:20:50.306
Charlotte Schultze: Hm. Many still had reserves, those who have preserved their homes, but most of the people are really not so well dressed any more. Most of the people were bombed out and had lost everything.

00:20:50.306 --> 00:20:59.722
David Boder: Now what has become of all the clothing which was taken from the Jews, let us say in Theresienstadt, and was taken away everywhere before they were transported? [See Mr. Schlaefrig, Chapter 26.]

00:20:59.722 --> 00:21:08.142
Charlotte Schultze: Well, you must consider that the warehouses [?] were bombed out, that all the things went up in flames.

00:21:08.142 --> 00:21:08.598
David Boder: So that you think...

00:21:08.598 --> 00:21:11.935
Charlotte Schultze: So everything is gone. Take for instance, Dresden.

00:21:11.935 --> 00:21:12.085
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:12.085 --> 00:21:23.240
Charlotte Schultze: Dresden is completely destroyed, and with it all the clothing and everything. We, for instance, got out of our home only with that which I had on my body. Everything else was gone.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.824
David Boder: Oh, you were bombed out in Dresden?

00:21:24.824 --> 00:21:26.674
Charlotte Schultze: Completely bombed out.

00:21:26.674 --> 00:21:27.621
David Boder: When did that happen?

00:21:27.621 --> 00:21:30.055
Charlotte Schultze: On the 13th of February, ’45.

00:21:30.055 --> 00:21:33.999
David Boder: What was there, an air attack? By whom?

00:21:33.999 --> 00:21:35.726
Charlotte Schultze: I don’t know. It was at night.

00:21:35.726 --> 00:21:36.261
David Boder: At night?

00:21:36.261 --> 00:21:38.439
Charlotte Schultze: And whooo!

00:21:38.439 --> 00:21:40.940
David Boder: And there was a big bombardment.

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:41.289
Charlotte Schultze: There was a big bombardment.

00:21:41.289 --> 00:21:45.436
David Boder: And where did you and your family go for safety?

00:21:45.436 --> 00:21:48.624
Charlotte Schultze: We were in a common shelter at the railroad station.

00:21:48.624 --> 00:21:48.987
David Boder: Ah.

00:21:48.987 --> 00:21:53.812
Charlotte Schultze: Dresden had not a single bunker. It was completely without protection.

00:21:53.812 --> 00:21:54.108
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:54.108 --> 00:21:57.020
Charlotte Schultze: Only the governer had a large bunker for his family.

00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:00.354
David Boder: How come that here they had not dug bunkers?

00:22:00.354 --> 00:22:04.887
Charlotte Schultze: Well, that depended on...on the Gauleiter [governor appointed by the central government].

00:22:04.887 --> 00:22:05.365
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:05.365 --> 00:22:05.823
Charlotte Schultze: On him [?].

00:22:05.823 --> 00:22:11.229
David Boder: Now then. You went to the railroad station. But that was the most dangerous place?

00:22:11.229 --> 00:22:14.256
Charlotte Schultze: Well, yes. We were first in our cellar, at the first attack.

00:22:14.256 --> 00:22:14.902
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:14.902 --> 00:22:20.595
Charlotte Schultze: But then our house was not damaged. There fell only incendiaries in the neighborhood.

00:22:20.595 --> 00:22:20.862
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:20.862 --> 00:22:24.762
Charlotte Schultze: Then we went to the suburb to see our old parents.

00:22:24.762 --> 00:22:26.256
David Boder: Your parents or those of your husband?

00:22:26.256 --> 00:22:31.853
Charlotte Schultze: My husband’s parents. My father-in-law had died then at the age of 84 after the attack.

00:22:31.853 --> 00:22:32.188
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:32.188 --> 00:22:35.371
Charlotte Schultze: My mother-in-law is still alive at the age of 78.

00:22:35.371 --> 00:22:36.175
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:36.175 --> 00:22:44.600
Charlotte Schultze: Also my father [is still alive]. And when we went to the station [?] to get home there was a second alarm.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:45.521
David Boder: [Words not clear.]

00:22:45.521 --> 00:22:51.788
Charlotte Schultze: There was no more time [words not clear]. So we had to take refuge in the railroad station, in the railroad station’s shelter.

00:22:51.788 --> 00:22:52.772
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:52.772 --> 00:22:53.612
Charlotte Schultze: And...

00:22:53.612 --> 00:22:55.728
David Boder: Was the railroad station’s shelter underground?

00:22:55.728 --> 00:22:56.532
Charlotte Schultze: Underground.

00:22:56.532 --> 00:22:58.648
David Boder: Those must have been the tunnels [for pedestrians] which are [located] underground.

00:22:58.648 --> 00:23:02.942
Charlotte Schultze: No, no. These were the shelters of the administration of the government bank.

00:23:02.942 --> 00:23:03.241
David Boder: Ja.

00:23:03.241 --> 00:23:05.871
Charlotte Schultze: In a large all-brick house.

00:23:05.871 --> 00:23:06.317
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:06.317 --> 00:23:21.625
Charlotte Schultze: Very large. There stood [word not clear]. To be sure, hundreds of people have perished. And by a miracle we got out, that is my son, my little one, and I. We climbed out after all clear [?] through a break [in the floor?]...

00:23:21.625 --> 00:23:21.951
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:21.951 --> 00:23:23.174
Charlotte Schultze: And...

00:23:23.174 --> 00:23:23.541
David Boder: Your husband?

00:23:23.541 --> 00:23:25.971
Charlotte Schultze: My husband returned only the next morning at eight.

00:23:25.971 --> 00:23:26.465
David Boder: Aha.

00:23:26.465 --> 00:23:30.783
Charlotte Schultze: So all day we thought my husband was dead, and he thought that we were dead.

00:23:30.783 --> 00:23:33.105
David Boder: You didn’t...he did not know that you got out.

00:23:33.105 --> 00:23:36.010
Charlotte Schultze: No. We met only the next evening.

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:36.838
David Boder: At home.

00:23:36.838 --> 00:23:39.169
Charlotte Schultze: No. In the meantime our house, too, was gone.

00:23:39.169 --> 00:23:40.212
David Boder: Oh, the house was gone.

00:23:40.212 --> 00:23:41.973
Charlotte Schultze: Completely demolished.

00:23:41.973 --> 00:23:42.419
David Boder: Hm.

00:23:42.419 --> 00:23:44.705
Charlotte Schultze: His office was completely demolished.

00:23:44.705 --> 00:23:45.291
David Boder: Hm.

00:23:45.291 --> 00:23:47.371
Charlotte Schultze: The house of my parents-in-law was gone.

00:23:47.371 --> 00:23:47.578
David Boder: Hm.

00:23:47.578 --> 00:23:51.060
Charlotte Schultze: And the house of my father. We were all completely bombed out.

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:52.868
David Boder: So Dresden was really so [badly] hit?

00:23:52.868 --> 00:23:55.716
Charlotte Schultze: Yes. It is completely destroyed.

00:23:55.716 --> 00:23:56.015
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:56.015 --> 00:24:00.202
Charlotte Schultze: The whole [word not clear] city. My brother, too, is dead, and all my women friends...

00:24:00.202 --> 00:24:04.377
David Boder: How come? Was your brother killed in the bombardment?

00:24:04.377 --> 00:24:06.520
Charlotte Schultze: He, too, passed on. He, too, perished.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.209
David Boder: And what happened to the [your] old people?

00:24:09.209 --> 00:24:15.894
Charlotte Schultze: My parents-in-law still extricated themselves from the rubble.

00:24:15.894 --> 00:24:17.702
David Boder: Oh, the house was bombarded and you got them out?

00:24:17.702 --> 00:24:19.498
Charlotte Schultze: Yes, completely.

00:24:19.498 --> 00:24:19.702
David Boder: And?

00:24:19.702 --> 00:24:23.064
Charlotte Schultze: And then they came as far as Cologne, to their home city.

00:24:23.064 --> 00:24:23.662
David Boder: Yes.

00:24:23.662 --> 00:24:35.061
Charlotte Schultze: And there my father-in-law found one night his doom due to a weak heart. Strangely enough he left Thuringia as a young man of 20 years [of age].

00:24:35.061 --> 00:24:35.318
David Boder: Hm.

00:24:35.318 --> 00:24:36.211
Charlotte Schultze: Then to Sweden.

00:24:36.211 --> 00:24:36.320
David Boder: Hm.

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:37.413
Charlotte Schultze: Then to America.

00:24:37.413 --> 00:24:38.119
David Boder: Yes.

00:24:38.119 --> 00:24:40.035
Charlotte Schultze: And on the day of his death...

00:24:40.035 --> 00:24:40.541
David Boder: Again in Thuringia.

00:24:40.541 --> 00:24:45.385
Charlotte Schultze: . . . landed again in Thuringia [incorrect: Cologne is not in Thuringia, but is in the Rhine province] in order to die there.

00:24:45.385 --> 00:24:46.739
David Boder: And your mother-in-law?

00:24:46.739 --> 00:24:48.906
Charlotte Schultze: My mother-in-law still lived in Coburg.

00:24:48.906 --> 00:24:50.953
David Boder: Hm.

00:24:50.953 --> 00:24:55.997
Charlotte Schultze: We took her then to Coburg so that she could remain in the American Zone.

00:24:55.997 --> 00:24:56.308
David Boder: Yes.

00:24:56.308 --> 00:24:58.391
Charlotte Schultze: You see [?]? so that she would be in contact with us.

00:24:58.391 --> 00:24:58.714
David Boder: Aha.

00:24:58.714 --> 00:25:00.717
Charlotte Schultze: And Dresden belongs to the Russian Zone.

00:25:00.717 --> 00:25:02.409
David Boder: And who supports her?

00:25:02.409 --> 00:25:09.132
Charlotte Schultze: For the time being she has enough to live on, and we hope [chuckle] that we will be able from there to send here somthing to eat. Maybe...

00:25:09.132 --> 00:25:13.730
David Boder: Aha. Did your acquaintances from America send you anything during this time [after the armistace]?

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:22.769
Charlotte Schultze: No. We received letters, but since everybody hoped that we shall soon return, they thought it not worthwhile [hearty laughter], and that is why...

00:25:22.769 --> 00:25:25.218
David Boder: [Cordially] Well, now, you will soon be in America.

00:25:25.218 --> 00:25:25.763
Charlotte Schultze: We hope...

00:25:25.763 --> 00:25:56.859
David Boder: [In English] This concludes the interview with Mrs. Charlotte Schultze, wife of a physician, hm, what they call here a German Aryan, who is now in the United States with the child, and will probably send over the affidavit for the wife...for his wife. We conclude the interview at 8 minutes of the counter index. An Illinois Institute of Technology wire recording. Munich, Germany. September the 20th, 1946.

00:25:56.859 --> 00:25:59.146
David Boder: [In German] Thank you very much, Frau doctor.

00:25:59.146 --> 00:26:05.326
Charlotte Schultze: There you are then...

00:26:05.326 --> 00:26:53.871
David Boder: [In English] This concludes Spool 137A. The other part will be Spool 137B and is the beginning of Bassfreund’s story. It may be advisable since we have only 8 minutes on this spool to combine this one with 136B and have Mrs. Charlotte Schultze all on one spool. But we will leave that for further checkup. Boder. October the 13th, 1950. MH156.
