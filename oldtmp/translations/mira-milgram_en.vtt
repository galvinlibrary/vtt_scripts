Mira Milgram: Although it turned out there wasn’t even a cellar.

00:11:16.506 --> 00:11:17.154
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:17.154 --> 00:11:23.516

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:24.481
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:24.481 --> 00:11:27.210

David Boder: Yes.

00:11:27.979 --> 00:11:38.758
Mira Milgram: And the next day, from nine in the morning, people started to gather in front of the house of the Jewish community, where the elders lived.

00:11:38.758 --> 00:11:39.647
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:39.647 --> 00:11:43.145
Mira Milgram: And then the militia came, cordoned off the house.

00:11:43.145 --> 00:11:44.125
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:44.125 --> 00:11:49.447

Mira Milgram: Weapons.

00:11:51.512 --> 00:11:52.266
David Boder: The Jewish community?

00:11:52.266 --> 00:11:53.502
Mira Milgram: The Jewish community.

00:11:53.502 --> 00:11:53.774
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:53.774 --> 00:12:02.593
Mira Milgram: Because in town they said that Jews shoot and they didn’t want to be guilty eh, let this happen...

00:12:02.593 --> 00:12:03.166
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:03.166 --> 00:12:07.975
Mira Milgram: That, that eh, this is said, you know...

00:12:07.975 --> 00:12:08.156
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:08.156 --> 00:12:09.015
Mira Milgram: Because it is not true.

00:12:09.015 --> 00:12:09.633
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:09.633 --> 00:12:27.271

00:12:30.045 --> 00:12:34.643
Mira Milgram: Who [unintelligible sentence end]. It will not happen without danger.

00:12:34.643 --> 00:12:35.638
David Boder: Yes. The militia.

00:12:35.638 --> 00:12:36.512
Mira Milgram: To the militia.

00:12:36.512 --> 00:12:36.904
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:36.904 --> 00:12:39.105
Mira Milgram: Then the military joined them.

00:12:39.105 --> 00:12:39.708
David Boder: Polish military.

00:12:39.708 --> 00:12:41.668
Mira Milgram: Yes.

00:12:41.668 --> 00:12:42.000
David Boder: Well?

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:49.734
Mira Milgram: He told them: You have to, eh...

00:12:49.734 --> 00:12:51.558
David Boder: Have to defend yourselves?

00:12:51.558 --> 00:12:55.267
Mira Milgram: Have to, have to, eh,...[Speaks Polish]

00:12:55.267 --> 00:12:55.855
David Boder: What are you saying in Polish?

00:12:55.855 --> 00:13:00.785
Mira Milgram: [speaks Polish] You have to watch, what you are doing.

00:13:00.785 --> 00:13:01.192
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:01.192 --> 00:13:02.669
Mira Milgram: It will not happen without danger.

00:13:02.669 --> 00:13:04.117
David Boder: The military said it to whom, to the Jews?

00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:05.941
Mira Milgram: My brother said it to them.

00:13:05.941 --> 00:13:06.876
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:06.876 --> 00:13:31.901
Mira Milgram: We, the whole world will shout at you: What are you doing here? They shot him then, and he was the only one who was shot, because the rest was murdered in terrible ways. One woman, who was eight months pregnant, they threw from the second floor onto bayonets. And that was...

00:13:31.901 --> 00:13:33.333
David Boder: Who had bayonets, the soldiers?

00:13:33.333 --> 00:13:35.112
Mira Milgram: The soldiers are downstairs.

00:13:35.112 --> 00:13:38.549
David Boder: Well, [unintelligible word] do tell me, [unintelligible word].

00:13:38.549 --> 00:13:57.988
Mira Milgram: Well, the soldiers stood downstairs. The soldiers afterwards claimed, they knew why they were sent there. They found out from there, when they were sent to the house that Jews had taken Aryan children and had...

00:13:57.988 --> 00:13:59.330
David Boder: Destroyed them.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:13:59.948
Mira Milgram: Murdered them.

00:13:59.948 --> 00:14:01.908
David Boder: Murdered them. Where there no officers?

00:14:01.908 --> 00:14:06.717
Mira Milgram: There were officers. My husband, eh, my brother, a “Major” [probably: shot him; “Major” is a military rank].

00:14:06.717 --> 00:14:09.883
David Boder: A “Major” [shot] him. Was he punished?

00:14:09.883 --> 00:14:15.717
Mira Milgram: That. I left Poland straight away.

00:14:15.717 --> 00:14:18.069
David Boder: You left Poland straight away.

00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:31.953
Mira Milgram: After three days I left Poland. I couldn’t stay there. [Unintelligible sentence beginning]...not. They...

00:14:31.953 --> 00:14:33.883
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:33.883 --> 00:14:52.669
Mira Milgram: Five people were massacred in such a way, that you didn’t know anymore whether they were a woman or a man. They couldn’t identify them, they don’t know who they are. 40 people where beaten to death, and two little children.

00:14:52.669 --> 00:14:57.689
David Boder: Now tell me what did the Polish government do afterwards.

00:14:57.689 --> 00:15:01.096
Mira Milgram: The Polish government did everything it could.

00:15:01.096 --> 00:15:01.820
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:06.494
Mira Milgram: The pogrom went on from nine in the morning until five in the afternoon.

00:15:06.494 --> 00:15:06.780
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:23.197
Mira Milgram: They dragged people out of the train, out of flats, and so on. The government sent people from Warsaw. They set up a, eh, they set up a drumhead court-martial.

00:15:23.197 --> 00:15:24.463
David Boder: Yes. Yes.

00:15:24.463 --> 00:15:36.988
Mira Milgram: Closing time and so on. But the worst is that people really believed that the Jews had killed the children and not only...

00:15:36.988 --> 00:15:37.471
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:37.471 --> 00:15:42.069
Mira Milgram: . . . the, even the intelligentsia believed it.

00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:43.019
David Boder: The intelligentsia...

00:15:43.019 --> 00:15:50.723
Mira Milgram: Yes. Because I myself spoke with some, who told me there has to be truth in it.

00:15:50.723 --> 00:15:51.220
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:51.220 --> 00:16:06.959
Mira Milgram: And when I explained to them, but where are the children. They boarded up the house, you know. Show me one mother who is missing a child. To that I did not get an answer.

00:16:06.959 --> 00:16:12.839
David Boder: So the general disposition in Poland concerning Jews is what?

00:16:12.839 --> 00:17:13.899
Mira Milgram: Hitler has worked there too long. It is a wordless anti-Semitism. The Jews are afraid to be there. And in my opinion the Jews have achieved so much that they deserve to be left in peace. I myself know. [Unintelligible sentence]. I went to school there, I studied at university, I have friends amongst the Polish. But I didn’t have a good feeling, I was afraid. I think this will maybe improve after years. But now this is not the place for Jews. The government will do such a thing again, the government does not [unintelligible sentence end].

00:17:13.899 --> 00:17:14.683
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:14.683 --> 00:17:21.618
Mira Milgram: But the population, that [unintelligible sentence end].

00:17:21.618 --> 00:17:26.698
David Boder: Mrs. Milgram, and now you want to go to Palestine. And you want...

00:17:26.698 --> 00:17:32.970
Mira Milgram: [interrupts] This is my only wish now. I want to bring up my child in Palestine. Because...

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:34.643
David Boder: But then, yes?

00:17:34.643 --> 00:17:44.684
Mira Milgram: His father was a Zionist, the little one is a Zionist, he has only the one [unintelligible word] in Palestine [unintelligible sentence end].

00:17:44.684 --> 00:17:50.247
David Boder: Tell me, that the, that the child has been taught in Catholic religion, has that not in one way or another...

00:17:50.247 --> 00:17:56.744
Mira Milgram: But he has forgotten everything, he is a hot Jew, and...

00:17:56.744 --> 00:18:00.604
David Boder: But for a short period of time did he not really pray in Polish, Catholic...

00:18:00.604 --> 00:18:02.519
Mira Milgram: No, never.

00:18:02.519 --> 00:18:04.253
David Boder: And he acted the part all the time...

00:18:04.253 --> 00:18:09.454
Mira Milgram: He acted the part all the time as a five-year-old child, in a way you can really believe in it.

00:18:09.454 --> 00:18:12.409
David Boder: And he knew it wasn’t the truth...

00:18:12.409 --> 00:18:19.298
Mira Milgram: He knew everything. Everything, but now he speaks little. He sees a lot...

00:18:19.298 --> 00:18:19.841
David Boder: Speaks little.

00:18:19.841 --> 00:18:21.047
Mira Milgram: . . . and speaks little.

00:18:21.047 --> 00:18:27.922
David Boder: Well, but tell me, Mrs. Milgram, it isn’t all quiet in Palestine either. What do you think of that?

00:18:27.922 --> 00:18:46.389
Mira Milgram: I would rather want to be unpopular there, than in another, popular in another place. There I at least know what I will fight for when I go there. In Poland I didn’t know it.

00:18:46.389 --> 00:18:53.535
David Boder: Oh well. Thank you very much, Mrs. Milgram. Does the boy maybe want to say something? No? Alright.

00:18:53.535 --> 00:18:56.339
Mira Milgram: He maybe [unintelligible sentence end].

Mira Milgram: In America as well.

00:19:02.143 --> 00:19:07.691

Esther Freilich: Freilich.

00:19:17.249 --> 00:19:40.782
David Boder: Esther Freilich, whose mother has covered Spool 36, 37 and 38. Esther is 13 years old.

00:19:40.782 --> 00:20:03.644
