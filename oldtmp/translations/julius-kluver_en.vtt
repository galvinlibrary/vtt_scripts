00:00:01.417 --> 00:00:24.086
David Boder: [In English] September 19, 1946 in a large refugee center in the Funkkasernen we are interviewing Mr. Julius Klüver, a leader of the Mennonite Group, which moved gradually from [Name] Russia up to the American Zone in Germany.

00:00:24.086 --> 00:00:31.353
David Boder: [In German]Now tell me again, Mr. Klver, what is your name, how old are you and where were you born?

00:00:31.353 --> 00:00:49.257
Julius Klüver: My name is Julius Klver. I am 43 years old. I was born in the province of Ekaterinoslav in the district of Dniprovs’ke, in the Ukraine on the farm of my father, Alexandrovka.

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:58.094
David Boder: Now tell me, Mr. Klver, where were you and what happened to you when the war started?

00:00:58.094 --> 00:01:17.347
Julius Klüver: At the beginning of the war I was in the Ukraine in the city of Zaporoje. I worked in a factory as a bookkeeper.

00:01:17.347 --> 00:01:32.722
David Boder: So what happened when the war started?

00:01:32.722 --> 00:02:10.767
Julius Klüver: When the war started I continued working at the plant until the arrival of the Germans. When the Germans arrived it became the goal of the Mennonites as well as my own to get away west as far as possible and from there to join the Mennonites of Canada, of U.S.A., or of Paraguay. That was our bold aim since 1920, and now we decided to endeavor to reach this goal.

00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:16.201
David Boder: Now tell me, how many Mennonites were there altogether [In Russia]?

00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:27.207
Julius Klüver: By the year 1930, there were about 80,000 Mennonites.

00:02:27.207 --> 00:02:29.237
David Boder: Where did they all live?

00:02:29.237 --> 00:02:32.972
Julius Klüver: Most of them lived in southern Russia.

00:02:32.972 --> 00:02:36.677
David Boder: Tell me, were most of the Mennonites German?

00:02:36.677 --> 00:03:20.512
Julius Klüver: The Mennonites are Dutch. They are of Dutch origin. They migrated from the Low Countries to southern Russia upon an invitation from the Empress Catherine the Second and her successors. They came to Russia to colonize the southern Ukraine. They left the low countries, the shores of the northern sea, on account of their religion and their refusal to bear arms. We were promised in Russia that we should be able to obey by our faith which precludes the bearing of arms.

00:03:20.512 --> 00:03:21.898
David Boder: And that means what?

00:03:21.898 --> 00:03:28.055
Julius Klüver: Not to be compelled to serve as soldiers, which is against our religious beliefs.

00:03:28.055 --> 00:03:31.260
David Boder: Did the Russians keep their promise?

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.272
Julius Klüver: The Russians kept their promise up to the year of 1920.

00:03:36.272 --> 00:03:39.567
David Boder: Did the Tzars never draft the Mennonites?

00:03:39.567 --> 00:03:48.935
Julius Klüver: During the epoch of the Tzars we were not compelled to bear arms but we were drafted for labor service under the department of forestry.

00:03:48.935 --> 00:03:54.037
David Boder: So when were the Mennonites drafted into the army for the first time?

00:03:54.037 --> 00:03:57.543
Julius Klüver: Since the formation of the Soviet Republic.

00:03:57.543 --> 00:04:06.260
David Boder: So it was then when it started? What did the Mennonites do about it?

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:29.352
Julius Klüver: The Mennonites refused, and were taken to the courts. I too was hailed before the courts in 1923 and it took a long time before I was released on the grounds of my religious beliefs.

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:31.081
David Boder: How did they happen to release you?

00:04:31.081 --> 00:04:40.009
Julius Klüver: It was possible to be released by order of the Soviet Courts.

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:45.081
David Boder: Was everybody taken separately before the courts?

00:04:45.081 --> 00:04:54.250
Julius Klüver: A large number of our young men were tried at that time. Many were released; many were not.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.545
David Boder: And what did they do to those who were not released?

00:04:57.545 --> 00:05:03.780
Julius Klüver: A few were drafted, but most of them were sentenced to labor service in Siberia.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.623
David Boder: So. Well, what happened when the Germans came into Russia?

00:05:09.623 --> 00:05:16.554
Julius Klüver: As soon as the Germans arrived in Russia part of the Mennonites moved immediately west.

00:05:16.554 --> 00:05:19.668
David Boder: You mean they went to meet the Germans?

00:05:19.668 --> 00:05:36.325
Julius Klüver: No, but they moved westward. To us it was immaterial. If there would have come a French army, a Dutch army, a Turkish army, we had only one goal. To get away from the East.

00:05:36.325 --> 00:05:37.831
David Boder: Why?

00:05:37.831 --> 00:05:48.412
Julius Klüver: Because of our parents, our sisters and our brothers. Nearly all were exiled to Siberia. We were deprived of all our belongings.

00:05:48.412 --> 00:05:50.069
David Boder: When did that happen?

00:05:50.069 --> 00:06:53.014
Julius Klüver: That happened between 1920 and 1935. Take for example, my case. My father was rich. He owned a farm. My father was shot in 1920 because he was a rich man. I, then a youngster of 17, had to go for years in hiding so that I should not be shot. I had one aim, to get away to our brothers in Canada. I have in Canada three sisters. I have neither brothers or sisters here. My wife has four sisters in Canada and all we were longing for was back to our Mennonites. For example, from my ten uncles that I had here, nine of them are gone. Five died in Siberia, four died in prison, and the sole reason for their arrest was that they were rich people.

00:06:53.014 --> 00:07:00.767
David Boder: Well, so when did that movement westward start? Were you in Saratov when the war started.

00:07:00.767 --> 00:07:19.785
Julius Klüver: No, I lived in Zaporoje. The Germans arrived in the winter of ’41 and part of us went already in 1942 to Poland. I went to Poland at the beginning of 1943.

00:07:19.785 --> 00:07:21.532
David Boder: Was that with permission of the Germans?

00:07:21.532 --> 00:07:52.792
Julius Klüver: Yes, that was with the permission of the Germans. We were permitted to go west. I went to Poland and stayed in Poland nearly three years. But when the front approached towards Poland I went forward from Poland to Germany and so I arrived in Chemnitz. I stayed in Chemnitz only two weeks. Then there came that big air attack. I was bombed out and I fled with my family westward and so I arrived in Munich.

00:07:52.792 --> 00:07:54.491
David Boder: When did you get to Munich?

00:07:54.491 --> 00:08:00.949
Julius Klüver: I arrived in Munich in January, 1945.

00:08:00.949 --> 00:08:06.292
David Boder: Didn’t the Germans demand from the Mennonites any labor service?

00:08:06.292 --> 00:08:31.636
Julius Klüver: A few of the Mennonites were compelled to work. A few even were drafted or were about to be drafted but not many. Most of them stuck to their religious faith which prohibits bearing arms and were working on various jobs and in this way they escaped service in the armed forces.

00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:37.491
David Boder: And how many of you Mennonites are now here in this lager?

00:08:37.491 --> 00:08:53.015
Julius Klüver: We are in this lager 552 Mennonites. Most of them want to go to Paraguay. A certain number want to go to Canada where their relatives are, who have sent them already the affidavits.

00:08:53.015 --> 00:08:58.117
David Boder: Tell me, were the Mennonites in Canada permitted not to join the services?

00:08:58.117 --> 00:09:10.286
Julius Klüver: To the best of my knowledge the Canadians have rendered in this war mostly labor service. Only a few joined the army or navy.

00:09:10.286 --> 00:09:13.943
David Boder: What do you mean, the Canadians in general or the Canadian Mennonites?

00:09:13.943 --> 00:09:16.184
Julius Klüver: The Canadian Mennonites.

00:09:16.184 --> 00:09:25.804
David Boder: Tell me, how were these 500 Mennonites gathered together? With how many did you leave Russia.

00:09:25.804 --> 00:09:28.335
Julius Klüver: I left only with my family.

00:09:28.335 --> 00:09:29.672
David Boder: How many people were you?

00:09:29.672 --> 00:09:39.672
Julius Klüver: We were four people. So we were gathered together from the whole American zone. One by one. Nearly all women and children.

00:09:39.672 --> 00:09:40.847
David Boder: Where are the men?

00:09:40.847 --> 00:09:51.491
Julius Klüver: Most of the men are in Siberia. They were all rounded up in 1936 and 1937. Before the war in Russia.

00:09:51.491 --> 00:09:56.834
David Boder: Are they permitted in Siberia to follow their Mennonite faith?

00:09:56.834 --> 00:10:09.105
Julius Klüver: They are prisoners in various camps. In labor service. We have no word from them and we have no word whether they are still alive or not!

00:10:09.105 --> 00:10:16.587
David Boder: How many grown up men are there among these 500 people?

00:10:16.587 --> 00:10:22.593
Julius Klüver: About one-third are men.

00:10:22.593 --> 00:10:24.804
David Boder: The others are women and children?

00:10:24.804 --> 00:10:30.117
Julius Klüver: Women and children. We have about 250 children here.

00:10:30.117 --> 00:10:34.696
David Boder: Do you expect the Canadians to let you in?

00:10:34.696 --> 00:10:58.204
Julius Klüver: We are quite sure of that. We have already the permission to come to Paraguay and we expect that the first transport of 430 Mennonites will depart for Paraguay. There are large Mennonite colonies in that country. And the people from here go to their relatives or to their friends in these Mennonite colonies.

00:10:58.204 --> 00:11:06.168
David Boder: Now tell me, for how many generations did your family live in Russia?

00:11:06.168 --> 00:11:13.379
Julius Klüver: My grandfather came to Russia as a little child.

00:11:13.379 --> 00:11:15.740
David Boder: How long ago about was that?

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:19.848
Julius Klüver: That must have been eighty or ninety years ago, about ninety years ago.

00:11:19.848 --> 00:11:26.547
David Boder: Now tell me, how did it happen that the Mennonites still preserved in Russia the German language?

00:11:26.547 --> 00:12:13.604
Julius Klüver: You see, we talk among ourselves still Dutch, the Frisian Platt. Only our hymn book, our Bibles, and our school books were in German. Originally we used a Dutch dialect, but since the Mennonite colonies in southern Russia were surrounded by a large number of German colonies and since years ago there was a better supply of German books the language of our schools and of our religion has become German. But up to now, we still talk among ourselves at home the Dutch language.

00:12:13.604 --> 00:12:28.827
David Boder: Tell me, Mr. Klver, what other differences besides the refusal to bear arms is there between the Mennonite religion and the other Protestant religions?

00:12:28.827 --> 00:12:38.086
Julius Klüver: First of all, we have no infant baptism, but adult baptism.

00:12:38.086 --> 00:12:39.441
David Boder: What do you mean by adult baptism?

00:12:39.441 --> 00:13:06.492
Julius Klüver: Our people are baptized at the age of 17, 18, 19 years. Not as children, but when they reach the age between 17 and 19. Second, the refusal to bear arms. Third we do not swear. We say yes, yes, or no, no, but we do not make any vows.

00:13:06.492 --> 00:13:10.209
David Boder: Not even to your country, to your fatherland?

00:13:10.209 --> 00:13:12.631
Julius Klüver: Never.

00:13:12.631 --> 00:13:19.300
David Boder: But otherwise you are Protestants?

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.462
Julius Klüver: Of Protestant faith.

00:13:22.462 --> 00:13:36.480
David Boder: Now tell me where were you at the end, during the last year of the war? When Germany was gradually losing the war?

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:48.799
Julius Klüver: From the beginning of 1943 until the end of 1945 I lived in Poland. I lived near Lesmanstadt as a bookkeeper at a factory.

00:13:48.799 --> 00:13:49.594
David Boder: In Poland?

00:13:49.594 --> 00:13:50.317
Julius Klüver: In Poland.

00:13:50.317 --> 00:13:52.950
David Boder: When did you get to the American zone?

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:56.878
Julius Klüver: I arrived at the American zone in January, 1945.

00:13:56.878 --> 00:13:58.788
David Boder: And before that you were in Poland?

00:13:58.788 --> 00:13:59.613
Julius Klüver: In Poland.

00:13:59.613 --> 00:14:03.300
David Boder: So where were you when the Russians came to Poland?

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:13.884
Julius Klüver: When the front came near Poland I moved towards Germany.

00:14:13.884 --> 00:14:15.180
David Boder: Farther west? Did the Germans permit it?

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.150
Julius Klüver: Yes. They permitted it.

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:21.650
David Boder: Were you in any districts that were severely bombed?

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:51.574
Julius Klüver: From Poland I came to Chemnitz. There I stayed two weeks and intended to look for work. I already rented there a room but in two weeks the house was entirely bombed out and to save the life of my family I fled on foot with a single trunk to the city. I escaped to Munich. Here lived a cousin of mine and I joined him.

00:14:51.574 --> 00:14:54.176
David Boder: Did he always live in Munich? Or was he too a refugee?

00:14:54.176 --> 00:15:00.381
Julius Klüver: He too was a refugee, and he came here from Russia in 1942.

00:15:00.381 --> 00:15:07.291
David Boder: And so you all gathered here gradually and you now are ready to travel further?

00:15:07.291 --> 00:15:23.809
Julius Klüver: When we arrived in Munich we couldn’t find lodging in the city. We went to the peasants and I found a place 40 kilometers from Munich. Here I worked for a peasant for more than a year as a hired man [his calendaric dates are apparently confused].

00:15:23.809 --> 00:15:25.297
David Boder: And where was your family?

00:15:25.297 --> 00:15:27.627
Julius Klüver: My family was with me too, on the farm.

00:15:27.627 --> 00:15:29.646
David Boder: Who was with you? Your wife and two children?

00:15:29.646 --> 00:15:43.381
Julius Klüver: My wife and two daughters. We all worked for the peasant without pay. We had to live on our ration cards and now and then we got a little bit of milk from him.

00:15:43.381 --> 00:15:47.369
David Boder: What do you mean you lived on your ration cards. Didn’t the peasant feed you?

00:15:47.369 --> 00:15:57.773
Julius Klüver: No. We got our ration cards and we had to work. We just got a supplement of a little bit of milk.

00:15:57.773 --> 00:16:00.315
David Boder: And for your other food you had to pay?

00:16:00.315 --> 00:16:01.731
Julius Klüver: That I paid for.

00:16:01.731 --> 00:16:03.189
David Boder: How did you pay?

00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:17.418
Julius Klüver: I still had some money from my previous earnings. One didn’t need too much money in order to buy the supplies that one was allowed to get on his card.

00:16:17.418 --> 00:16:24.810
David Boder: You say you still had some money. What kind of currency was it?

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:29.250
Julius Klüver: That were Germen marks, reichmarks.

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:33.358
David Boder: How could you get them in exchange for Russian rubles?

00:16:33.358 --> 00:16:48.400
Julius Klüver: That wasn’t saved in Russian rubles. These were my earnings from Poland. There we were paid already in reichmarks. I had no more currency in Russian rubles.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:53.713
David Boder: Now let us clear that up. You and your family worked for the peasant. Isn’t that so?

00:16:53.713 --> 00:16:55.129
Julius Klüver: Yes.

00:16:55.129 --> 00:16:58.906
David Boder: And he did not give you the food free of charge?

00:16:58.906 --> 00:17:09.659
Julius Klüver: That was against the law. If one had a ration card he had no right to eat with the peasant, that is, if one kept house for himself.

00:17:09.659 --> 00:17:13.466
David Boder: Then why did you take out the ration cards?

00:17:13.466 --> 00:17:32.854
Julius Klüver: That was the rule that all the refugees had to take out ration cards. That was because I had my family with me. Had I been alone I would not have been given a ration card and I would have to eat with the peasant. But since I had my family I took my meals with my family. My wife did her own cooking.

00:17:32.854 --> 00:17:42.243
David Boder: And you paid for the food, and gave him your ration stamps except for some milk now and then? And he did not pay you anything?

00:17:42.243 --> 00:17:53.044
Julius Klüver: No, he didn’t pay me any money. He told me that I am working for our lodging and the few things that he gave me. I had a table and a few chairs and in exchange for that I had to work.

00:17:53.044 --> 00:17:54.540
David Boder: What does that mean he had given them?

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.776
Julius Klüver: He placed them into my room.

00:17:56.776 --> 00:17:57.976
David Boder: Oh, he had given them to you!

00:17:57.976 --> 00:18:00.267
Julius Klüver: Yes.

00:18:00.267 --> 00:18:03.436
David Boder: Was this peasant a Nazi?

00:18:03.436 --> 00:18:28.225
Julius Klüver: He was a Nazi up to 1936. And then he left the party because he was afraid that in time he would lose his farm. He was a rich peasant and that is why he did not agree with the Nazis. He was afraid that in time they will organize some farm cooperative.

00:18:28.225 --> 00:18:29.020
David Boder: Something like the Russian collective farms?

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:41.942
Julius Klüver: Something of that kind, and that is why in time he became aroused against the Nazis. At the beginning he had joined them and was a member of the party up to 1936.

00:18:41.942 --> 00:18:52.496
David Boder: And you believe that such a peasant was uninformed either through relatives or friends about the goings-on in concentration camps?

00:18:52.496 --> 00:19:07.026
Julius Klüver: I think he might not have known it. Moreover he had very little interest for such things. And he wasn’t getting together with the people too much. Here in Bavaria the peasants do not mingle very much.

00:19:07.026 --> 00:19:17.430
David Boder: Now tell me, you had to opportunity to observe the Germans. What did such a peasant think about the war?

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:31.960
Julius Klüver: Many of them thought that Germany will win. But many also predicted that Germany will never win the war because the superiority of the enemy was too great.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.725
David Boder: And where were you on the date of Germany’s surrender?

00:19:35.725 --> 00:19:38.478
Julius Klüver: In the same village with the peasant.

00:19:38.478 --> 00:19:41.623
David Boder: And what did the people say then?

00:19:41.623 --> 00:20:07.718
Julius Klüver: Many of the Germans were very glad that the war was over and their sons will return home. And the peasants turned to their work. They said, ‘It will be bad at the beginning, but in time we will get on our feet again as good peasants.’ They all had hope for a better future.

00:20:07.718 --> 00:20:11.784
David Boder: Tell me, did the peasants eat well during the war?

00:20:11.784 --> 00:20:24.025
Julius Klüver: Most of them did. They found ways not to surrender everything and they took good care of themselves and ate very well. Most of them.

00:20:24.025 --> 00:20:35.091
David Boder: Now as an observer—what do you think of the present German situation?

00:20:35.091 --> 00:21:30.294
Julius Klüver: How can I tell you? I have so little interest in the situation right here. My interests, my thoughts are all overseas. To get away from here as soon as possible so that finally I should have a homeland. Since 1920 I had not a single night in peace. And to have a little, little land of my own. As I observe the Germans here, soon times will be better for them. That I heard in the villages. They think it may be bad for three, four, five years, but eventually they will have a better life, a freer life, better than they had under the Nazis.

00:21:30.294 --> 00:21:46.571
David Boder: Now tell me, what was the attitude of the peasant with whom you lived and of his kind, what was their attitude toward the Jews?

00:21:46.571 --> 00:21:57.950
Julius Klüver: Their attitude toward the Jews was bad. One could feel that also among the peasants. They did not love the Jewish people.

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:01.546
David Boder: And what was the attitude of the Mennonites of Russia?

00:22:01.546 --> 00:22:50.775
Julius Klüver: The Mennonites despise no nation. On the contrary the Mennonites feel that they are persecuted for their religion just as the Jews. We often compared ourselves with the Jews. Only we are a small, poor, little people, while the Jews are richer, larger in number, and have a stronger organization. We are too few and weak, but the religious persecutions of the last four hundred years are the same for us as for the Jews. We have no homeland, we have no country that we may call our own. We were once in Holland, we were near Danzig in the region of the Polish corridor, we were in southern Russia and nowhere did we find a homeland.

00:22:50.775 --> 00:22:57.534
David Boder: Now tell me, do you think that one can have a homeland if he is not ready to defend it with arms?

00:22:57.534 --> 00:23:11.389
Julius Klüver: According to our convictions—yes. In accordance with our faith one can have a homeland even if one does not defend it with arms.

00:23:11.389 --> 00:23:20.773
David Boder: In all other respects the Mennonites recognize the authority of the state, I mean do you pay taxes?

00:23:20.773 --> 00:23:26.478
Julius Klüver: Yes. In all other respects the Mennonites...they recognize the state.

00:23:26.478 --> 00:23:31.972
David Boder: Did you ever hear of a sect in the United States, the Jehovah’s Witnesses?

00:23:31.972 --> 00:23:37.888
Julius Klüver: That is a different sect. No.

00:23:37.888 --> 00:23:43.159
David Boder: Or take the Dukhobors. They refuse to pay taxes.

00:23:43.159 --> 00:23:44.677
Julius Klüver: No, I never heard of them.

00:23:44.677 --> 00:23:46.755
David Boder: So the Mennonites pay their taxes.

00:23:46.755 --> 00:24:00.622
Julius Klüver: Very readily. To the best of my knowledge it was so before, and it is so now. We are not greedy. We pay, we want to work, we want to keep up our religion and we are ready to fulfill all our duties to any state.

00:24:00.622 --> 00:24:06.598
David Boder: You were telling me that you worked as a bookkeeper. Are there many Mennonites who do not work on the land?

00:24:06.598 --> 00:24:13.146
Julius Klüver: Very few. Most of them are farmers, peasants.

00:24:13.146 --> 00:24:15.899
David Boder: Are there any Mennonites in Mexico?

00:24:15.899 --> 00:24:18.429
Julius Klüver: Yes, there are Mennonites in Mexico.

00:24:18.429 --> 00:24:20.507
David Boder: Where do they live there?

00:24:20.507 --> 00:24:25.056
Julius Klüver: That I can’t tell you exactly but I know there are Mennonites in Mexico.

00:24:25.056 --> 00:24:32.207
David Boder: Do you know by any chance whether these came from Canada or did they come directly from Russia?

00:24:32.207 --> 00:24:34.267
Julius Klüver: This I couldn’t tell you either.

00:24:34.267 --> 00:24:37.562
David Boder: How did they get to Paraguay?

00:24:37.562 --> 00:25:10.901
Julius Klüver: There is already an order since April from the government of Paraguay that all Mennonites may come to that country unconditionally. There is even no control of health conditions. Only come to Paraguay. Our Mennonites have built their colonies in that large Chaco region which was formerly impassable and our colonies have flourished there.

00:25:10.901 --> 00:25:15.642
David Boder: Now tell me, are there more women than men in your group?

00:25:15.642 --> 00:25:17.491
Julius Klüver: Many more women than men.

00:25:17.491 --> 00:25:28.919
David Boder: Now what will become of these women? Many of them do not know if they are widows or not. May a Mennonite woman marry a non-Mennonite?

00:25:28.919 --> 00:25:36.521
Julius Klüver: According to our laws a woman may marry only among Mennonites.

00:25:36.521 --> 00:25:41.521
David Boder: May that not lead to some difficulties?

00:25:41.521 --> 00:25:49.907
Julius Klüver: So far it did not. [He apparently has turned away from the microphone on purpose while making an additional remark].

00:25:49.907 --> 00:26:03.311
David Boder: Oh no. I do not refer to promiscuity. I simply mean that the situation may become difficult for a large number of women to find suitable men.

00:26:03.311 --> 00:26:29.044
Julius Klüver: That certainly will be a problem, but so far we had very few mixed marriages in our colony. Lately it has become more frequent because so many of our men are away and that is why some Mennonite women have married non-Mennonites.

00:26:29.044 --> 00:26:36.345
David Boder: Tell me, Mr. Klver, do Mennonites convert into their religion people of other faiths?

00:26:36.345 --> 00:26:41.375
Julius Klüver: No. We remain in our own community.

00:26:41.375 --> 00:26:47.942
David Boder: If somebody wants to join the Mennonites would you accept him?

00:26:47.942 --> 00:26:56.328
Julius Klüver: No. He must be born a Mennonite. We are not only a religion. We consider ourself a people.

00:26:56.328 --> 00:27:09.081
David Boder: Now let us suppose a Spaniard, an Uruguayan sees your way of life and likes it. Will he still be unable to become a Mennonite.

00:27:09.081 --> 00:27:36.913
Julius Klüver: No. There are some very rare exceptions. If such a Spaniard or a person of another nationality happens to live in our colony in our village, and takes on our religion, learns our language and continues to live among our people, an exception can be made. Then he must be baptised.

00:27:36.913 --> 00:29:10.800
David Boder: [In English] This concludes Spool 132 - an interview with Mr. Julius Klüver - a so-called Leader of the Germanic Group of the Funkkasernen Camp in, hm, near München. This is the first case that we have interviewed a displaced person, who took – so to say - advantage of the situation in Russia to move west and to get to a country where their reluctance to carry arms because of religious principles should be respected. September 19, 1956 in Munich, Germany at the UNRA Detention Camp, a Illinois Institute of Technology wire recording. The machine is not at – in the best order, one condenser is broken, seems to be broken of, because the machine got a very rough ride. But nevertheless we took the record, because we hope that the transcription will be satisfactory. September 19, 1946 – Illinois Institute of Technology wire recording.
