00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:17.182
David Boder: [In English] München, September the 20th, 1946, at Funkenkasernen, a camp for transient displaced people [such who are ready to leave for overseas in the more or less near future]. I have here before me Mrs. Hildegarde Franz who is expecting to go to the United States.

00:00:17.182 --> 00:00:23.337
David Boder: [In German] Now, Mrs. Franz, please turn around, make yourself comfortable. You will be warm. Take off your coat. [Speak] in this direction. Right?

00:00:23.337 --> 00:00:24.087
Hildegarde Franz: Yes.

00:00:24.087 --> 00:00:28.118
David Boder: Now, Mrs. Franz, will you tell me again, what is your full name?

00:00:28.118 --> 00:00:29.228
Hildegarde Franz: Hildegarde Franz.

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:30.916
David Boder: How old are you, if one may know?

00:00:30.916 --> 00:00:32.354
Hildegarde Franz: Seventy-five years old.

00:00:32.354 --> 00:00:33.541
David Boder: [surprised] No-o-o!

00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:34.197
Hildegarde Franz: Yes.

00:00:34.197 --> 00:00:40.001
David Boder: That is impossible. You look so young [and that was indeed so].

00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:41.219
Hildegarde Franz: Yes. I am.

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.688
David Boder: You are seventy-five years old?

00:00:42.688 --> 00:00:43.798
Hildegarde Franz: [in a soft, fading voice] Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:00:43.798 --> 00:00:51.766
David Boder: Now then, Mrs. Franz, will you be so kind and tell me where you were when the war started?

00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:52.704
Hildegarde Franz: My...

00:00:52.704 --> 00:00:59.422
David Boder: And then what happened to you afterwards until now.

00:00:59.422 --> 00:01:13.127
Hildegarde Franz: I was in Nuremberg. With my sons and my husband we were working with my relatives at Schloss Ardien [?] near Nuremberg, in a “ready to wear” [business].

00:01:13.127 --> 00:01:13.638
David Boder: Yes.

00:01:13.638 --> 00:01:19.927
Hildegarde Franz: And in the ’34 we were compelled to sell the business since we were Jews, no?

00:01:19.927 --> 00:01:21.842
David Boder: Already so far back, ’34?

00:01:21.842 --> 00:01:23.123
Hildegarde Franz: ’34.

00:01:23.123 --> 00:01:24.670
David Boder: Now, Hitler was elected when?

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.358
Hildegarde Franz: In ’33.

00:01:25.358 --> 00:01:28.264
David Boder: Yes, if one figures that way. He came to power in ’33.

00:01:28.264 --> 00:01:28.920
Hildegarde Franz: Yes, yes.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.623
David Boder: And in ’34 you were compelled...

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:50.026
Hildegarde Franz: We were compelled to sell our business for certain reasons, because our employees were completely of National Socialist [Nazi] orientation and reported every customer who purchased from us to the Braunhaus [Nazi headquarters], so that the people...

00:01:50.026 --> 00:01:50.728
David Boder: Withdrew? [German word order does not permit verbatim translation of this sentence].

00:01:50.728 --> 00:01:53.538
Hildegarde Franz: . . . withdrew their patronage. They were afraid to buy from us.

00:01:53.538 --> 00:01:54.940
David Boder: What kind of a business did you say it was?

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.860
Hildegarde Franz: “Ready-to-wear” for ladies. A very large business of ladies’ “ready-to-wear”.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.307
David Boder: A “ready-to-wear” establishment. Did you yourselves also manufacture the dresses?

00:02:03.307 --> 00:02:04.573
Hildegarde Franz: No, no, not that.

00:02:04.573 --> 00:02:06.354
David Boder: You simply purchased them from the manufacturer...

00:02:06.354 --> 00:02:06.854
Hildegarde Franz: Purchased.

00:02:06.854 --> 00:02:08.229
David Boder: . . . and then sold them ready-made.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.667
Hildegarde Franz: Sold.

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:09.714
David Boder: And that was in Heidelberg?

00:02:09.714 --> 00:02:11.167
Hildegarde Franz: That was in Nuremberg.

00:02:11.167 --> 00:02:12.151
David Boder: In Nuremberg, excuse me.

00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:12.760
Hildegarde Franz: Of course.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.533
David Boder: That is exactly there where now the trial takes place of the...

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:18.220
Hildegarde Franz: Yes, yes.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.721
David Boder: . . . of the Nazis.

00:02:18.721 --> 00:02:19.659
Hildegarde Franz: Yes, yes. And so...

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:20.050
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.372
Hildegarde Franz: . . . then my husband...Ours was a mixed marriage. It was...So my husband wanted...

00:02:24.372 --> 00:02:25.653
David Boder: Your husband was a Christian?

00:02:25.653 --> 00:02:32.734
Hildegarde Franz: Yes. Because I was a Jewess, my husband with my sons had to be discharged, simply put out on the street, so to speak. No?

00:02:32.734 --> 00:02:33.734
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:33.734 --> 00:02:39.093
Hildegarde Franz: Nu, yes. The sons then emigrated to America.

00:02:39.093 --> 00:02:42.749
David Boder: Oh, in 1934 your sons still had a chance to emigrate to America?

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:43.812
Hildegarde Franz: Yes, yes.

00:02:43.812 --> 00:02:44.906
David Boder: Who sent them the affidavits?

00:02:44.906 --> 00:02:48.531
Hildegarde Franz: My son happened to meet a gentleman at...

00:02:48.531 --> 00:02:50.329
David Boder: You, you have no relatives [in the United States], so they were...

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.407
Hildegarde Franz: . . . the Leipzig Fair.She refers to the Leipzig Trade Fair, a major European trade fair which began in the Middle Ages and still continues today.1 He provided for my son a contact with America.

00:02:54.407 --> 00:02:55.172
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:55.172 --> 00:02:58.297
Hildegarde Franz: And he remained there [where?] for a year, and from there [?] he...

00:02:58.297 --> 00:02:58.828
David Boder: To...

00:02:58.828 --> 00:03:00.328
Hildegarde Franz: . . . he got his...

00:03:00.328 --> 00:03:01.406
David Boder: Affidavit.

00:03:01.406 --> 00:03:03.052
Hildegarde Franz: . . . his entrance [permit]...

00:03:03.052 --> 00:03:03.630
David Boder: To America.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.797
Hildegarde Franz: . . . was obtained. Since then he is in America with one and the same firm, since ten years ago, since ten years ago with the same firm.

00:03:08.797 --> 00:03:10.438
David Boder: With the same firm, yes.

00:03:10.438 --> 00:03:12.906
Hildegarde Franz: Employed by Kresge.

00:03:12.906 --> 00:03:13.671
David Boder: Kresge?

00:03:13.671 --> 00:03:14.733
Hildegarde Franz: Kresge, yes.

00:03:14.733 --> 00:03:17.139
David Boder: What is that, the five-and-ten firm. Or...

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:18.435
Hildegarde Franz: A very large firm.

00:03:18.435 --> 00:03:19.413
David Boder: That very large five-and-ten [firm?]

00:03:19.413 --> 00:03:21.173
Hildegarde Franz: Employed already for ten years.

00:03:21.173 --> 00:03:23.125
David Boder: Yes. Yes. Now that means one son is there.

00:03:23.125 --> 00:03:23.812
Hildegarde Franz: Yes.

00:03:23.812 --> 00:03:25.108
David Boder: And do you have any more in America?

00:03:25.108 --> 00:03:29.608
Hildegarde Franz: One son is in the state of Colorado. Yes, Colorado.

00:03:29.608 --> 00:03:30.248
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:30.248 --> 00:03:34.451
Hildegarde Franz: In Durango. And for six years he holds the same position.

00:03:34.451 --> 00:03:36.608
David Boder: Aha. Are they married there?

00:03:36.608 --> 00:03:38.640
Hildegarde Franz: One of my sons is married.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.890
David Boder: He did not take his wife with him?

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.344
Hildegarde Franz: Yes. His wife is there.

00:03:41.344 --> 00:03:43.640
David Boder: He took her with him from here?

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.314
Hildegarde Franz: [words not clear; they speak simultaneously] No. He got married in America.

00:03:44.314 --> 00:03:45.923
David Boder: He got married in America.

00:03:45.923 --> 00:03:46.360
Hildegarde Franz: Yes.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.907
David Boder: Now with whom then are you here, Mrs. Franz?

00:03:48.907 --> 00:03:50.141
Hildegarde Franz: I am all alone.

00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:52.000
David Boder: What happened to your husband?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.360
Hildegarde Franz: My husband died.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.829
David Boder: When?

00:03:53.829 --> 00:04:05.610
Hildegarde Franz: My husband was very, very ill due to all these harassments and the hardships that we endured. Then my husband became very, very ill, true [you see?]?

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:06.188
David Boder: Yes.

00:04:06.188 --> 00:04:08.766
Hildegarde Franz: And due to the air raids...

00:04:08.766 --> 00:04:09.328
David Boder: Yes.

00:04:09.328 --> 00:04:24.273
Hildegarde Franz: . . . which we lived through. It was afterwards, so [that] I for nearly a full half-year hardly got out of my clothes, only in order to help my sick husband, when the [air] attacks would start, so that I could take him to the cellar. For a full half-year I did not take off my clothes.

00:04:24.273 --> 00:04:25.335
David Boder: Where were you during all that time?

00:04:25.335 --> 00:04:26.616
Hildegarde Franz: In Nuremberg, in Nuremberg.

00:04:26.616 --> 00:04:27.319
David Boder: In Nuremberg.

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:29.203
Hildegarde Franz: Yes. Then in ’43 I was...

00:04:29.203 --> 00:04:34.234
David Boder: Now one moment [apparently adjustment of the equipment]. Now go on. What happened then in ’43?

00:04:34.234 --> 00:04:48.268
Hildegarde Franz: Now in ’43 it was...when it [the war] became so frightful, I went with my husband for a few weeks to the country. There he became very, very sick. I had [to provide for] an operation. I had to return him to Nuremberg in order to submit him to an operation.

00:04:48.268 --> 00:04:50.242
David Boder: Now your husband was a Christian?

00:04:50.242 --> 00:04:50.804
Hildegarde Franz: Yes, and...

00:04:50.804 --> 00:04:51.554
David Boder: He was a German?

00:04:51.554 --> 00:04:53.655
Hildegarde Franz: He was German. And then he died in Nuremberg.

00:04:53.655 --> 00:04:54.967
David Boder: And he died in Nuremberg.

00:04:54.967 --> 00:05:08.076
Hildegarde Franz: In 40—...on the 19th of October, ’43, my husband died, and on the 17th of January, ’44, I was, within two days, from my apartment remo—...[she weeps silently]

00:05:08.076 --> 00:05:10.591
David Boder: What do you mean by “within two days”?

00:05:10.591 --> 00:05:32.004
Hildegarde Franz: [choking with tears] I had to vacate my apartment and was moved to the KZ, where...horribly...[she cries bitterly] Let me take hold of myself a bit. [Pause.] At the age of seventy-three, after two months I was dragged away to Theresienstadt.

00:05:32.004 --> 00:05:34.439
David Boder: Now well, what did they say? Why?

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:36.501
Hildegarde Franz: Just nothing. I am a Jewess.

00:05:36.501 --> 00:05:37.048
David Boder: Yes.

00:05:37.048 --> 00:05:39.610
Hildegarde Franz: So I was...was simply dragged off.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.655
David Boder: Now tell me. You say they gave you two days to liquidate your apartment.

00:05:43.655 --> 00:05:50.250
Hildegarde Franz: They wanted...yes. I could not move any more from the apartment. I was compelled to leave everything as it stood and lay. No? [in a fading voice] I was simply...

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.922
David Boder: [whispers] A bit louder.

00:05:50.922 --> 00:05:54.511
Hildegarde Franz: [in full voice] I was simply dragged away to Theresienstadt.

00:05:54.511 --> 00:05:58.167
David Boder: Now tell me, how many people went with you to Theresienstadt?

00:05:58.167 --> 00:06:00.354
Hildegarde Franz: With my transport...

00:06:00.354 --> 00:06:00.839
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:02.761
Hildegarde Franz: . . . went fifteen people.

00:06:02.761 --> 00:06:04.979
David Boder: And how were you transported to Theresienstadt?

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:10.967
Hildegarde Franz: We were [sent] to Theresienstadt by train under guard, that is under the SA [Sturmabteilung, also sometimes known as Brown Shirts or Storm Troopers]...

00:06:10.967 --> 00:06:11.561
David Boder: From...

00:06:11.561 --> 00:06:12.718
Hildegarde Franz: . . . of the Gestapo.

00:06:12.718 --> 00:06:14.453
David Boder: Was that a passenger RR-car?

00:06:14.453 --> 00:06:16.968
Hildegarde Franz: It was a third class RR-car [an ordinary passenger car, normally decent transportation].

00:06:16.968 --> 00:06:17.468
David Boder: A third class RR-car?

00:06:17.468 --> 00:06:17.952
Hildegarde Franz: Yes.

00:06:17.952 --> 00:06:19.749
David Boder: Who were the other people with you?

00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:32.053
Hildegarde Franz: There was a Mr. Kaufman, a...also a [Mrs.] Dessauer—he, too, had died [her husband]—Dessauer, Kaufman, a Mr. Krengel, a Frau Dr. Rodmar [?]...

00:06:32.053 --> 00:06:32.912
David Boder: [whispers] A bit louder.

00:06:32.912 --> 00:06:35.819
Hildegarde Franz: A Frau Dr. Rodmar, a...

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:41.511
David Boder: Now well, I mean what kind of people were they that they had remained in Nuremberg so long in the first place?

00:06:41.511 --> 00:06:44.433
Hildegarde Franz: They all were of mixed marriages.

00:06:44.433 --> 00:06:46.933
David Boder: Oh, they were people of mixed marriages [Jew-Christian].

00:06:46.933 --> 00:06:51.886
Hildegarde Franz: Yes, and they were all in ‘3...[correction] ’44 dragged away to Theresienstadt.

00:06:51.886 --> 00:06:55.605
David Boder: But of these mixed marriages they took only the Jewish half?

00:06:55.605 --> 00:06:56.198
Hildegarde Franz: Yes, yes.

00:06:56.198 --> 00:06:58.448
David Boder: The Jewish half of the mixed marriages.

00:06:58.448 --> 00:06:59.760
Hildegarde Franz: The Jewish half of the mixed marriages, yes, yes.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.088
David Boder: These were then [possibly after the death of the Christian half] sent away to Theresienstadt.

00:07:01.088 --> 00:07:01.541
Hildegarde Franz: Only the Jews.

00:07:01.541 --> 00:07:04.791
David Boder: Now tell me, how did you find Theresienstadt at that time? [See Mr. Schlaefrig, Chapter 26.]Boder’s note refers to the interview with Friedrich Schläfrig, conducted on August 23, 1946 in Paris, France. Schläfrig was also imprisoned in the ghetto for older adults at Theresienstadt.2

00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:06.337
Hildegarde Franz: Well, we have Theresienstadt...we were...

00:07:06.337 --> 00:07:07.916
David Boder: There were various periods in Theresienstadt.

00:07:07.916 --> 00:07:09.244
Hildegarde Franz: Yes.

00:07:09.244 --> 00:07:12.295
David Boder: Now then, where, what kind of a place [accommodations] was assigned to you? Where...

00:07:12.295 --> 00:07:15.357
Hildegarde Franz: They assigned to us an attic.

00:07:15.357 --> 00:07:17.091
David Boder: An attic? Of a building?

00:07:17.091 --> 00:07:20.653
Hildegarde Franz: Of a building, where we had to live...sleep and live. And...

00:07:20.653 --> 00:07:21.840
David Boder: And who lived below?

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:28.101
Hildegarde Franz: Below was a Siechenheim where sick people were lying. [The interviewer did not get the word “Siechenhiem.” It sounded somewhat like “Ziegenheim,” goat home, hence the confusion below.]

00:07:28.101 --> 00:07:28.835
David Boder: What kind of a home?

00:07:28.835 --> 00:07:30.820
Hildegarde Franz: Siechenheim, where only sick [people] were lying.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.554
David Boder: Why is it called Ziegenheim?

00:07:32.554 --> 00:07:34.101
Hildegarde Franz: That’s what they called it. I don’t know.

00:07:34.101 --> 00:07:36.726
David Boder: Aha. How do you spell it?

00:07:36.726 --> 00:07:39.451
Hildegarde Franz: S...S-I-E-C-H...

00:07:39.451 --> 00:07:40.014
David Boder: S?

00:07:40.014 --> 00:07:44.150
Hildegarde Franz: Siechen. S-I-E-C-H-E-N-H-E-I-M. Siechenheim.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:45.275
David Boder: Siechenhiem [the word “Siech” meaning chronic, incurable, or incapacitating illness].

00:07:45.275 --> 00:07:45.822
Hildegarde Franz: Yes.

00:07:45.822 --> 00:07:47.620
David Boder: Yes. And you lived there upstairs...

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:48.417
Hildegarde Franz: Upstairs.

00:07:48.417 --> 00:07:49.334
David Boder: . . . Above that home for the incurables [Siechenheim].

00:07:49.334 --> 00:07:50.761
Hildegarde Franz: We lived...

00:07:50.761 --> 00:07:52.464
David Boder: Now how many people were you in one room?

00:07:52.464 --> 00:07:56.464
Hildegarde Franz: About thirty-five people were lodged in that attic.

00:07:56.464 --> 00:07:58.370
David Boder: Only women?

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.365
Hildegarde Franz: Only...[correction] women and men. Everybody together.

00:08:00.365 --> 00:08:01.349
David Boder: In the same room?

00:08:01.349 --> 00:08:02.442
Hildegarde Franz: Everything in the same room.

00:08:02.442 --> 00:08:03.692
David Boder: So how did you sleep there?

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:07.155
Hildegarde Franz: Now, well, we slept in a kind of box with a paillasse [sack of straw].

00:08:07.155 --> 00:08:10.653
David Boder: Aha. For each one separately? A bed for each one, so to speak?

00:08:10.653 --> 00:08:11.668
Hildegarde Franz: A bed, yes.

00:08:11.668 --> 00:08:12.621
David Boder: With a paillasse.

00:08:12.621 --> 00:08:13.636
Hildegarde Franz: Paillasse, yes.

00:08:13.636 --> 00:08:15.479
David Boder: Now what kind of things did you take with you?

00:08:15.479 --> 00:08:27.327
Hildegarde Franz: A little...I was permitted to take with me only the most indispensable. A coffer with clothes, which I had been using at the time, a little underwear, a blanket and a pillow.

00:08:27.327 --> 00:08:30.093
David Boder: Aha. And that they let you keep in Theresienstadt?

00:08:30.093 --> 00:08:37.235
Hildegarde Franz: I was allowed to keep it. But many...I happened to be lucky, but from many it was stolen, so that they had nothing. They...

00:08:37.235 --> 00:08:43.800
David Boder: So. And tell me, how was it afterwards in Theresienstadt?

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:44.641
Hildegarde Franz: Nu, yes...

00:08:44.641 --> 00:08:45.437
David Boder: How long were you there, and...

00:08:45.437 --> 00:08:48.922
Hildegarde Franz: A year and a half. Until the liberation by the Russians had come.

00:08:48.922 --> 00:08:50.484
David Boder: Were you well?

00:08:50.484 --> 00:08:53.574
Hildegarde Franz: For seven weeks I lay in the hospital.

00:08:53.574 --> 00:08:54.886
David Boder: In the same Siechenheim?

00:08:54.886 --> 00:08:58.901
Hildegarde Franz: No, no. In a hospital. “The Grand Hotel” it was called.

00:08:58.901 --> 00:08:59.619
David Boder: Yes.

00:08:59.619 --> 00:09:03.522
Hildegarde Franz: And there I lay for seven weeks, because I lost weight so quickly.

00:09:03.522 --> 00:09:04.022
David Boder: Hm.

00:09:04.022 --> 00:09:15.577
Hildegarde Franz: Within three months, four months, I lost forty pounds. That was too much. So all my inner organs, heart and everything, were affected by it. True?

00:09:15.577 --> 00:09:16.249
David Boder: Hm.

00:09:16.249 --> 00:09:17.984
Hildegarde Franz: And so I lay for seven weeks in the hospital.

00:09:17.984 --> 00:09:20.546
David Boder: And what did they do for you?

00:09:20.546 --> 00:09:34.155
Hildegarde Franz: [weeping] In the hospital? Oh, dear God. How much could they do? I was lying in the hospital. I was treated with [unclear; still in tears]. I was discharged too early, because this hospital was really used only for people sick of the lungs.

00:09:34.155 --> 00:09:34.827
David Boder: Aha.

00:09:34.827 --> 00:09:37.526
Hildegarde Franz: And so I was returned to my attic.

00:09:37.526 --> 00:09:39.651
David Boder: Who were the physicians in this hospital?

00:09:39.651 --> 00:09:42.557
Hildegarde Franz: That was a Dr. Guttman.

00:09:42.557 --> 00:09:44.291
David Boder: Were they Jewish physicians?

00:09:44.291 --> 00:09:46.276
Hildegarde Franz: They were Jewish physicians. There were only Jews there.

00:09:46.276 --> 00:09:46.619
David Boder: Yes, and the...

00:09:46.619 --> 00:09:47.291
Hildegarde Franz: Only Jewish...

00:09:47.291 --> 00:09:49.710
David Boder: Yes, I understand. And the physicians were Jewish, true?

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:51.085
Hildegarde Franz: They were Jewish, yes.

00:09:51.085 --> 00:09:59.767
David Boder: Now tell me, as time passed and it came nearer to the defeat, did the conditions change a bit in Theresienstadt?

00:09:59.767 --> 00:10:13.316
Hildegarde Franz: No. I mean at the end we did not believe any more in general [she weeps]—how should I say?—to be freed [?]. We were completely cut off from the world. We did not get any news, nothing.

00:10:13.316 --> 00:10:14.801
David Boder: No newspapers, no magazines?

00:10:14.801 --> 00:10:22.763
Hildegarde Franz: Nothing, nothing. No newspapers, no radio, no...not even a letter placed in a package. That too they took away.

00:10:22.763 --> 00:10:24.545
David Boder: Did you get any packages?

00:10:24.545 --> 00:10:26.413
Hildegarde Franz: I...No. Not a single one did I receive.

00:10:26.413 --> 00:10:26.991
David Boder: Why?

00:10:26.991 --> 00:10:29.913
Hildegarde Franz: [in tears] I got nothing. Nobody sent me anything. [unintelligible].

00:10:29.913 --> 00:10:32.381
David Boder: Didn’t you have any friends left in Heidelberg

00:10:32.381 --> 00:10:33.787
Hildegarde Franz: [correcting] In Nuremberg.

00:10:33.787 --> 00:10:36.303
David Boder: In Nuremberg, who had remained there?

00:10:36.303 --> 00:10:49.643
Hildegarde Franz: Yes, but I was...none of them sent me anything. I also did not request [demand] anything, because I did not want to embarrass those people. True? Because it was strictly prohibited that the Jews should have anything sent to them.

00:10:49.643 --> 00:10:52.721
David Boder: Now tell me, did you still have any money?

00:10:52.721 --> 00:10:54.784
Hildegarde Franz: In Theresienstadt, no, not a penny.

00:10:54.784 --> 00:10:55.613
David Boder: How come?

00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:57.738
Hildegarde Franz: I was not permitted to take any money.

00:10:57.738 --> 00:10:59.816
David Boder: Oh. Did you have any money in...

00:10:59.816 --> 00:11:04.637
Hildegarde Franz: But in Theresienstadt there was—sorry I don’t have it with me—there was a ghetto money [currency].

00:11:04.637 --> 00:11:05.324
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:05.324 --> 00:11:06.840
Hildegarde Franz: True? And...

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.012
David Boder: And who got that?

00:11:08.012 --> 00:11:09.215
Hildegarde Franz: That we got...

00:11:09.215 --> 00:11:10.450
David Boder: For what...

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:12.278
Hildegarde Franz: . . . so we could buy something.

00:11:12.278 --> 00:11:14.747
David Boder: Now, did you get that money for nothing, or...

00:11:14.747 --> 00:11:17.537
Hildegarde Franz: We got every month fifty crowns, true?

00:11:17.537 --> 00:11:18.115
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:18.115 --> 00:11:18.912
Hildegarde Franz: Ghetto money.

00:11:18.912 --> 00:11:20.177
David Boder: Yes. With that Moses picture on it?

00:11:20.177 --> 00:11:23.493
Hildegarde Franz: Moses’ picture on it. Yes, yes. I have saved [as a curiosity] a few of them.

00:11:23.493 --> 00:11:24.493
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:24.493 --> 00:11:26.634
Hildegarde Franz: We all had to wear the Jewish star, no?

00:11:26.634 --> 00:11:27.384
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:27.384 --> 00:11:33.884
Hildegarde Franz: And we were...Now the food was more [less] than little.

00:11:33.884 --> 00:11:37.169
David Boder: How were you fed? Did you cook there in your quarters or...

00:11:37.169 --> 00:11:41.834
Hildegarde Franz: No. With...we were fed from a [central] kitchen with...

00:11:41.834 --> 00:11:43.387
David Boder: And who fetched the food?

00:11:43.387 --> 00:11:48.637
Hildegarde Franz: That all of us had to get. We had to call for it. We had to fetch the food.

00:11:48.637 --> 00:11:50.527
David Boder: Did you stand in a queue? [She may not have understood the word queue. Maybe it was mispronounced.]

00:11:50.527 --> 00:11:52.652
Hildegarde Franz: No. Just on the street. There were streets.

00:11:52.652 --> 00:11:55.496
David Boder: And so you fetched your food and...Where did you eat it?

00:11:55.496 --> 00:12:08.022
Hildegarde Franz: [in tears; words not clear]...and we sat down on the bed and ate. A table we didn’t know any more. True? There were no tables in our room. Nu, so one had to sit down on his bed.

00:12:08.022 --> 00:12:12.162
David Boder: Yes. So. Did you keep your own bed linen?

00:12:12.162 --> 00:12:19.647
Hildegarde Franz: Yes. I had my own bed linen. These I took with me. And I washed them regularly.

00:12:19.647 --> 00:12:21.725
David Boder: Hm. Did you have enough soap?

00:12:21.725 --> 00:12:26.515
Hildegarde Franz: Soap? [chuckle] What soap? Well, we got some soap paste.

00:12:26.515 --> 00:12:27.187
David Boder: Hm.

00:12:27.187 --> 00:12:28.531
Hildegarde Franz: And of that there was very little.

00:12:28.531 --> 00:12:32.264
David Boder: Yes. And then? Did it not get better towards the end?

00:12:32.264 --> 00:12:35.060
Hildegarde Franz: Oh. There began to come commissions.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.029
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:36.029 --> 00:12:37.979
Hildegarde Franz: From Sweden and from Switzerland [International Red Cross?].

00:12:37.979 --> 00:12:38.745
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:38.745 --> 00:12:40.917
Hildegarde Franz: And it had to become a bit better for us.

00:12:40.917 --> 00:12:41.385
David Boder: Hm.

00:12:41.385 --> 00:12:56.421
Hildegarde Franz: And everything had...Now what they wanted to show, the Nazis, that they showed, that was put in order. And the rest remained as it was. Then we would get once a bit more food, and when they were gone, the commission, then they deducted it again from us. Then we got less again. No?

00:12:56.421 --> 00:13:00.374
David Boder: So. Yes. Who were the Nazis with whom you had come in contact?

00:13:00.374 --> 00:13:12.070
Hildegarde Franz: We had less contact with the Nazis. It was the Council of the Elders who received the orders from the Nazis, and the Council of the Elders had to execute them.

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:14.679
David Boder: Do you remember any people from the Council of the Elders?

00:13:14.679 --> 00:13:23.571
Hildegarde Franz: [recollecting] From the Council of the Elders? I really...Wait please...One—what was his name? I met a Mr. Meier. Otherwise, no one.

00:13:23.571 --> 00:13:24.055
David Boder: No one.

00:13:24.055 --> 00:13:45.377
Hildegarde Franz: Because once I was summoned to the commandant’s office where I was confronted with a will which I and my husband had made out in the year ’32. And they asked me at the commandant’s office [in tears] if that was in the handwriting of my husband, and they told me to declare it void.

00:13:45.377 --> 00:13:46.361
David Boder: Why void it?

00:13:46.361 --> 00:14:00.031
Hildegarde Franz: Well, I don’t know. I did not agree to that. I said to myself that I have lived with my husband in a very happy marriage, a forty-three year old happy marriage, and that the family of my husband is sacred to me [a will in their favor should stand]. Thus I explained it to them. That was...

00:14:00.031 --> 00:14:02.126
David Boder: Was that a Jewish group that [told] you...

00:14:02.126 --> 00:14:03.251
Hildegarde Franz: No. These were the...

00:14:03.251 --> 00:14:04.189
David Boder: The S[S]...

00:14:04.189 --> 00:14:07.717
Hildegarde Franz: The S[S]. That was the Gestapo that questioned me. The SS were...

00:14:07.717 --> 00:14:10.764
David Boder: Yes. What was there in the will that was not to their liking?

00:14:10.764 --> 00:14:16.202
Hildegarde Franz: Well, at that time I assigned everything to the name of my husband, no?

00:14:16.202 --> 00:14:16.546
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:16.546 --> 00:14:21.744
Hildegarde Franz: And if I somehow had voided it then they would have taken over everything. No?

00:14:21.744 --> 00:14:22.385
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:22.385 --> 00:14:23.073
Hildegarde Franz: And so there was [?]...

00:14:23.073 --> 00:14:24.261
David Boder: Now what was there to take over?

00:14:24.261 --> 00:14:28.245
Hildegarde Franz: Well, my husband...we had some property. No? And the apartment...

00:14:28.245 --> 00:14:28.729
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:28.729 --> 00:14:42.004
Hildegarde Franz: . . . and the furniture, everything that there was. And so they were very eagerly after it in order to distribute it among their Nazis. And so they were greatly interested in getting it, but they could not do that, because everything was in the name of my husband [a Christian]. No?

00:14:42.004 --> 00:14:42.598
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:42.598 --> 00:14:46.741
Hildegarde Franz: And I did not agree to give it up.

00:14:46.741 --> 00:14:47.210
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:48.100
Hildegarde Franz: True?

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.584
David Boder: Did they not threaten you?

00:14:49.584 --> 00:15:03.952
Hildegarde Franz: No. I just told them that under no circumstances would I acquiesce to counteract the wishes of my husband, and the will should remain as is.

00:15:03.952 --> 00:15:08.720
David Boder: Yes. Now tell me, Mrs. Franz, how did the liberation come about?

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.829
Hildegarde Franz: Liberation came through the Russians.

00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:13.219
David Boder: How did they come in?

00:15:13.219 --> 00:15:15.551
Hildegarde Franz: That was the 8th, 9th of May. The 8th or 9th of May they came.

00:15:15.551 --> 00:15:16.328
David Boder: ’45.

00:15:16.328 --> 00:15:17.484
Hildegarde Franz: ’45.

00:15:17.484 --> 00:15:18.437
David Boder: And what happened then?

00:15:18.437 --> 00:15:23.591
Hildegarde Franz: Then it happened...They got away in flight, those [Nazis] who were still there. True? They retreated and abandoned everything in disorder.

00:15:23.591 --> 00:15:24.294
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:24.294 --> 00:15:27.544
Hildegarde Franz: And the Russians treated us decently.

00:15:27.544 --> 00:15:28.029
David Boder: So.

00:15:28.029 --> 00:15:35.230
Hildegarde Franz: We got more food, and we were given proper maintenance.

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:36.948
David Boder: So, and when did you return to Nuremberg?

00:15:36.948 --> 00:15:46.323
Hildegarde Franz: We returned the 2nd of July, ’45. We were called for [fetched] by the Americans from Theresienstadt.

00:15:46.323 --> 00:15:49.526
David Boder: In camions, buses?

00:15:49.526 --> 00:15:53.167
Hildegarde Franz: In buses, in such cargo trucks we were called for.

00:15:53.167 --> 00:15:55.995
David Boder: Now what did you find in Nuremberg of your property?

00:15:55.995 --> 00:16:01.329
Hildegarde Franz: Nothing at all. [Pause.] The house was bombed out.

00:16:01.329 --> 00:16:02.439
David Boder: Was it your own house?

00:16:02.439 --> 00:16:16.032
Hildegarde Franz: No, it was not my own house. Of my whole apartment I salvaged hardly anything. The people who had sublet from me have helped themselves [to my things] rather well.

00:16:16.032 --> 00:16:18.626
David Boder: Did you find some clothing? Did you...

00:16:18.626 --> 00:16:26.527
Hildegarde Franz: Nothing. There were only a few things, a few valuables that I had stored away with a Dr. Mombart.

00:16:26.527 --> 00:16:27.417
David Boder: A Christian?

00:16:27.417 --> 00:16:36.016
Hildegarde Franz: Yes. He kept it for me wonderfully, while the intermarried couple who lived in my apartment did exactly the contrary. [See note at end of chapter.] But I don’t want [to do anything] against these people.

00:16:36.016 --> 00:16:37.328
David Boder: Oh yes, you don’t want to complain...

00:16:37.328 --> 00:16:41.919
Hildegarde Franz: It is over. I don’t want to demand [prosecute]. They have deprived me of a lot.

00:16:41.919 --> 00:16:43.653
David Boder: That was an intermarried family that lived there.

00:16:43.653 --> 00:16:44.247
Hildegarde Franz: Yes, yes.

00:16:44.247 --> 00:16:46.059
David Boder: And nothing happened to them during...

00:16:46.059 --> 00:16:52.168
Hildegarde Franz: They left the apartment afterwards. A bomb hit [the house], true?

00:16:52.168 --> 00:16:53.792
David Boder: Oh, and then?

00:16:53.792 --> 00:16:58.019
Hildegarde Franz: It tore off one wall, but the things, the furniture remained standing. No?

00:16:58.019 --> 00:16:58.550
David Boder: Aha.

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:08.082
Hildegarde Franz: At least a large part. And what happened to it? I got a few pieces back, but in part they said they had nothing more.

00:17:08.082 --> 00:17:10.942
David Boder: So. And your bank account? Did you get that back?

00:17:10.942 --> 00:17:12.083
Hildegarde Franz: That I got back.

00:17:12.083 --> 00:17:13.317
David Boder: That the Americans have returned to you?

00:17:13.317 --> 00:17:13.911
Hildegarde Franz: Yes, yes.

00:17:13.911 --> 00:17:16.043
David Boder: And they permit you to take it out?

00:17:16.043 --> 00:17:17.684
Hildegarde Franz: They have...that [the permission] I got, too.

00:17:17.684 --> 00:17:19.512
David Boder: Yes. So that was safe.

00:17:19.512 --> 00:17:24.794
Hildegarde Franz: Yes, that was safe. But of the furnishings of my apartment, I have lost very, very much.

00:17:24.794 --> 00:17:30.411
David Boder: Now tell me, did you make quick contact with your sons?

00:17:30.411 --> 00:17:34.297
Hildegarde Franz: Yes, I obtained it through an American.

00:17:34.297 --> 00:17:35.957
David Boder: Did you telegraph, or what?

00:17:35.957 --> 00:17:46.863
Hildegarde Franz: My son sent me a cable first, because I had sent him a letter. And then he sent me a cable full of great joy about me still being alive [tears].

00:17:46.863 --> 00:17:47.395
David Boder: Hm.

00:17:47.395 --> 00:17:49.739
Hildegarde Franz: They didn’t figure that I was still alive.

00:17:49.739 --> 00:17:52.427
David Boder: Now when do you think you are leaving?

00:17:52.427 --> 00:17:54.255
Hildegarde Franz: I am leaving on the 24th.

00:17:54.255 --> 00:17:56.240
David Boder: Which 24th?

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.136
Hildegarde Franz: The 24th of September, with the transport.

00:17:58.136 --> 00:17:58.698
David Boder: Where to?

00:17:58.698 --> 00:17:59.604
Hildegarde Franz: To Bremen.

00:17:59.604 --> 00:18:02.526
David Boder: Oh. And then your ship leaves from Bremen?

00:18:02.526 --> 00:18:04.432
Hildegarde Franz: Oh, yes.

00:18:04.432 --> 00:18:08.729
David Boder: I thought that you are possibly going to Paris, because I am leaving the 29th...

00:18:08.729 --> 00:18:09.433
Hildegarde Franz: No, no.

00:18:09.433 --> 00:18:10.012
David Boder: . . . on the [S.S.] Washington.

00:18:10.012 --> 00:18:10.778
Hildegarde Franz: Yes, yes.

00:18:10.778 --> 00:18:12.184
David Boder: Then you are traveling on a military ship?

00:18:12.184 --> 00:18:13.059
Hildegarde Franz: Yes, yes.

00:18:13.059 --> 00:18:18.731
David Boder: So, that is, after all, a happy ending to such a bitter play [“gutes Ende zum boesen Spiel”].

00:18:18.731 --> 00:18:21.324
Hildegarde Franz: Yes. I have suffered much, and much.

00:18:21.324 --> 00:18:23.434
David Boder: Oh, that we know. That...

00:18:23.434 --> 00:18:32.059
Hildegarde Franz: [weeps bitterly] I have suffered frightfully. I really should not think about it, how hard it was for me.

00:18:32.059 --> 00:18:33.856
David Boder: Where are you going now? To Newark?

00:18:33.856 --> 00:18:34.559
Hildegarde Franz: To my son.

00:18:34.559 --> 00:18:36.871
David Boder: To Newark. And the other one you say is in...

00:18:36.871 --> 00:18:39.745
Hildegarde Franz: Is in Durango, Colorado. In the state of Colorado.

00:18:39.745 --> 00:18:42.401
David Boder: Yes. You would like it there, too. It is warm and beautiful there.

00:18:42.401 --> 00:18:45.479
Hildegarde Franz: [in tears] The children are, of course, glad that they still have a mother.

00:18:45.479 --> 00:18:47.541
David Boder: Of course, they should be glad.

00:18:47.541 --> 00:18:51.385
Hildegarde Franz: It was frightful. I can’t explain it to you at all, how terrible that all was. [She apparently weeps.]

00:18:51.385 --> 00:18:53.448
David Boder: Hm.

00:18:53.448 --> 00:18:58.010
Hildegarde Franz: I have gained fifty pounds.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:02.057
David Boder: How much did you weigh? How much do you weigh now?

00:19:02.057 --> 00:19:04.057
Hildegarde Franz: Now I must have about my old [original] weight.

00:19:04.057 --> 00:19:04.620
David Boder: How much?

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:09.849
Hildegarde Franz: About one hundred fifteen to one hundred twenty pounds. But when I returned from Theresienstadt I weighed only 70 pounds.

00:19:09.849 --> 00:19:14.835
David Boder: Tell me please, were there in Theresienstadt any selections, so that people were sent away from there?

00:19:14.835 --> 00:19:16.663
Hildegarde Franz: You mean transports [shipments usually to extermination camps]?

00:19:16.663 --> 00:19:17.991
David Boder: Yes, from Theresienstadt.

00:19:17.991 --> 00:19:19.679
Hildegarde Franz: Oh. God in heaven!

00:19:19.679 --> 00:19:20.866
David Boder: Tell us about it.

00:19:20.866 --> 00:19:26.397
Hildegarde Franz: Well, in my time [?] many, many people were sent to Poland.

00:19:26.397 --> 00:19:29.038
David Boder: For what reason? How were they chosen?

00:19:29.038 --> 00:19:52.913
Hildegarde Franz: Simply. [she speaks very fast, barely understandable, with great apprehension] For transport so-and-so many people were simply ordered. And the transports came for them, [and they went] part to Auschwitz, part to Belsen. They went to Posen where they were kept in KZs, and most of these people have all perished. Then there was one transport that was the last one, in October. There were eighteen thousand people dragged off from Theresienstadt.

00:19:52.913 --> 00:19:55.444
David Boder: [astonished] Eighteen thousand?

00:19:55.444 --> 00:19:59.288
Hildegarde Franz: Eighteen thousand people were dragged off from Theresienstadt to Poland.

00:19:59.288 --> 00:20:03.466
David Boder: How were they selected? Were any Reichs-Germans [actual German citizens whether Jews or non-Jews] with...among them?

00:20:03.466 --> 00:20:06.763
Hildegarde Franz: Germans and all possible...all possible nations were among them [?].

00:20:06.763 --> 00:20:08.966
David Boder: And how did you succeed in remaining there?

00:20:08.966 --> 00:20:10.872
Hildegarde Franz: Where? I?

00:20:10.872 --> 00:20:11.731
David Boder: In Theresienstadt, yes.

00:20:11.731 --> 00:20:14.387
Hildegarde Franz: [in a feeble voice] Yes, that I don’t know. I just was not among them.

00:20:14.387 --> 00:20:14.981
David Boder: What?

00:20:14.981 --> 00:20:17.690
Hildegarde Franz: I was not among them. I just did not get to it.

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:18.628
David Boder: [You] had luck.

00:20:18.628 --> 00:20:19.597
Hildegarde Franz: I had luck.

00:20:19.597 --> 00:20:26.113
David Boder: Were there any in the transports who came with you from Nuremberg?

00:20:26.113 --> 00:20:29.144
Hildegarde Franz: There were such [?] who were dragged off to Poland, to Auschwitz.

00:20:29.144 --> 00:20:29.909
David Boder: Aha.

00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:36.737
Hildegarde Franz: And of them only a single one [a woman] has returned. She was a younger person. The others have all perished.

00:20:36.737 --> 00:20:54.319
David Boder: [After a long pause possibly due to difficulty with the equipment, at which times some statements were made that could not be recorded; in English] There is a correction: four people from her transport were sent to Poland, and one returned of these four, a younger person.

00:20:54.319 --> 00:21:37.894
David Boder: This concludes the interview with Miss Hildegarde— [correction] with Mrs. Hildegarde Franz, age seventy-five, born in Nuremberg, or who lived in Nuremberg in a mixed marriage with a Christian husband, and who after his death was sent to Theresienstadt. She is now in the UNRRA camp at Funkenkasernen in Munich. And the 24th of this month—that means in four days—she is going to Bremen, and from Bremen sailing to the United States to her son in Newark, and to the other one in Colorado. This concludes the interview with Miss [Mrs.] Hildegarde Franz at twenty minutes of the spool [about 25 minutes running on 50 cycles]. An Illinois Institute of Technology wire recording.
