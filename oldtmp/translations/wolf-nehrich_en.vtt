00:00:00.375 --> 00:00:47.653
David Boder: [In English] Geneva, Switzerland, August the 26th, 1946, in a foyer for boys, who are in training in preparation for eh Palestine, mostly. It is a foyer where they live and have other lessons than their professional ones. Rather an old building but surrounded by beautiful gardens. The interviewee, as a matter of fact, I came here when the boys saw me at school and suggested, suggested that I come over. They apparently will be ready subjects. I’m going to stay here this evening. The first interviewee is Wolf Nehrich.

00:00:47.653 --> 00:00:50.548
David Boder: [In German] Eh, will you speak German or Yiddish, what do you want to speak?

00:00:50.548 --> 00:00:51.106
Wolf Nehrich: It doesn’t matter.

00:00:51.106 --> 00:01:06.136
David Boder: Yes so, speak whatever you want. Make yourself comfortable, and you don’t need to eh worry about whether you speak one language or another. Well, Nehrich, do tell me the full name. What age are you, and where are you born?

00:01:06.136 --> 00:01:13.614
Wolf Nehrich: My name is Wolf Nehrich. I am born in Poland in Debice [probably the name of the town] on the 26th of December 1928.

00:01:13.614 --> 00:01:16.493
David Boder: Eh, Debice is in which district?

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:20.745
Wolf Nehrich: It is in eh, well, it is, its name is Debice, which is in Poland.

00:01:20.745 --> 00:01:23.293

00:01:23.293 --> 00:01:25.600
Wolf Nehrich: [unintelligible]

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.545
David Boder: Was it Russian Poland or German Poland?

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:29.188
Wolf Nehrich: . . . it is Middle Poland.

00:01:29.188 --> 00:01:47.037
David Boder: Yes, it was Middle Poland. Well, Nehrich, tell me, eh, what happened to you, when the Germans came to Poland, when the war began, and everything you went through afterwards. Tell it as you like, speak freely, and you don’t need to hurry.

00:01:47.037 --> 00:01:58.262
Wolf Nehrich: The Germans arrived. We gradually had to flee, but despite everything they caught us. We get to know that the whole school was closed down. We were not allowed to learn anymore because of political reasons.

00:01:58.262 --> 00:02:00.026
David Boder: Which school did you go to?

00:02:00.026 --> 00:02:02.182
Wolf Nehrich: The college. A Jewish college.

00:02:02.182 --> 00:02:02.695
David Boder: Yes. And then?

00:02:02.695 --> 00:02:03.494
Wolf Nehrich: [unintelligible]

00:02:03.494 --> 00:02:04.052
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:04.052 --> 00:02:04.580
Wolf Nehrich: Yes.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.495
David Boder: How old where you then?

00:02:06.495 --> 00:02:08.229
Wolf Nehrich: Eh, back then I was eh eleven years old.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.088
David Boder: Eleven years.

00:02:09.088 --> 00:02:09.872
Wolf Nehrich: When the war began.

00:02:09.872 --> 00:02:14.033
David Boder: When the war began? And who was in your family?

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:16.536
Wolf Nehrich: Well, two more brothers and the parents.

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:17.727
David Boder: Your father and your mother?

00:02:17.727 --> 00:02:18.134
Wolf Nehrich: Yes.

00:02:18.134 --> 00:02:21.511
David Boder: What was your father occupied? What was his occupation?

00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:23.275
Wolf Nehrich: We had a store.

00:02:23.275 --> 00:02:23.833

00:02:23.833 --> 00:02:24.632
Wolf Nehrich: Textile goods.

00:02:24.632 --> 00:02:25.190
David Boder: What?

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.597
Wolf Nehrich: Textile goods.

00:02:25.597 --> 00:02:28.160
David Boder: A manufacture store. Yes. In [unintelligible place name].

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.683
Wolf Nehrich: Not in [unintelligible place name], in Königshütte.

00:02:29.683 --> 00:02:30.301
David Boder: What?

00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:30.934
Wolf Nehrich: In Königshütte.

00:02:30.934 --> 00:02:32.985
David Boder: Königshütte?

00:02:32.985 --> 00:02:35.292
Wolf Nehrich: In Königshütte. We lived in Königshütte, afterwards.

00:02:35.292 --> 00:02:35.910
David Boder: What is its name? Königs

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.930
Wolf Nehrich: Königshütte.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.578
David Boder: Königshütte. Alright. This sounds English. Königshütte.

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:42.091
Wolf Nehrich: Yes.

00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:47.051
David Boder: Now tell me, eh: How were, how old were your brothers and sisters?

00:02:47.051 --> 00:02:52.765
Wolf Nehrich: The younger brother is born in 1930, and the older brother in 1924.

00:02:52.765 --> 00:02:56.308
David Boder: I see. And, eh, your sister?

00:02:56.308 --> 00:02:57.378
Wolf Nehrich: I didn’t have one.

00:02:57.378 --> 00:02:58.856
David Boder: I see, so it was only two brothers.

00:02:58.856 --> 00:02:59.353
Wolf Nehrich: Yes

00:02:59.353 --> 00:02:59.745
David Boder: . . . and your parents.

00:02:59.745 --> 00:02:59.957
Wolf Nehrich: Yes.

00:02:59.957 --> 00:03:04.736
David Boder: Now, tell me what happened. Make yourself comfortable and talk.

00:03:04.736 --> 00:03:10.239
Wolf Nehrich: Then we had to move into a different city, because Königshütte was cleaned of Jews, we had to go to Będzin.

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.269
David Boder: So the Germans said, this city had to be cleaned of Jews.

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:14.264
Wolf Nehrich: Cleaned of Jews, yes.

00:03:14.264 --> 00:03:14.355
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:14.355 --> 00:03:23.898
Wolf Nehrich: Yes, we had to go to Będzin. We arrived in Będzin. I had to do a, some work or other, as not to be forced to go to Germany.

00:03:23.898 --> 00:03:26.536
David Boder: But your father had the store? What did he do with the store?

00:03:26.536 --> 00:03:28.134
Wolf Nehrich: They took the store away from us.

00:03:28.134 --> 00:03:29.370
David Boder: What does that mean? How did they take it away from you?

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.039
Wolf Nehrich: The Germans came, took the keys away and threw us out, and we then had to be without everything.

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:37.707
David Boder: And did you go away with some things?

00:03:37.707 --> 00:03:48.622
Wolf Nehrich: Yes, you could only take some small things. Whatever you were carrying you could take with you. You had to go to a different city, where there were only Jews. That was a kind of, a kind of, how do you call it, ghetto.

00:03:48.622 --> 00:03:50.446
David Boder: Yes. Did you go away by yourself?

00:03:50.446 --> 00:03:51.351
Wolf Nehrich: No, with the parents.

00:03:51.351 --> 00:03:55.979
David Boder: Yes, but I mean, did the family go away on their own? You bought a ticket and then you were off?

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:56.642
Wolf Nehrich: Yes, yes.

00:03:56.642 --> 00:03:57.668
David Boder: Well, go on.

00:03:57.668 --> 00:04:08.567
Wolf Nehrich: And then I came to this city Będzin. There you had to do work again, so I got into a factory, a side, in a carpenter’s workshop. There I worked for one and a half years.

00:04:08.567 --> 00:04:11.372
David Boder: You where eleven years old, back then? Or twelve?

00:04:11.372 --> 00:04:12.141
Wolf Nehrich: Eleven.

00:04:12.141 --> 00:04:12.518
David Boder: Eleven.

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:12.593
Wolf Nehrich: Yes.

00:04:12.593 --> 00:04:14.749
David Boder: How tall were you. Were you a tall boy?

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:17.116
Wolf Nehrich: No. Of course, when you are eleven years old you are still small.

00:04:17.116 --> 00:04:19.302
David Boder: Well then, how did a side factory accept you?

00:04:19.302 --> 00:04:28.061
Wolf Nehrich: Yes, there, eh, there was a Wehrmacht-factory. You produced crates for bombs and for the Wehrmacht desks and beds and such things, and there I worked.

00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:30.096
David Boder: What did you do there?

00:04:30.096 --> 00:04:39.865
Wolf Nehrich: Eh, working at machines and so on. Although I was still young, I was placed there and I had to work at them. The machines were dangerous, but you weren’t allowed to say anything, because you were a Jew.

00:04:39.865 --> 00:04:41.885
David Boder: I see. Well?

00:04:41.885 --> 00:04:47.312
Wolf Nehrich: And eh, thus dangerously I had soon worked half a year with the foreman. So I was there half a year.

00:04:47.312 --> 00:04:47.825
David Boder: As what?

00:04:47.825 --> 00:04:49.709
Wolf Nehrich: Well, as a, eh, carpenter, too.

00:04:49.709 --> 00:04:50.825
David Boder: Yes.

00:04:50.825 --> 00:05:07.106
Wolf Nehrich: And one, one and a half years in the factory. Together it was two years. Later on there had already been enough work done in the factory; they didn’t need any more crates for bombs and so on. Then they simply took me from home, as I was just returning from work, and they sent me into the camp.

00:05:07.106 --> 00:05:12.986
David Boder: I see. Tell me, how did they take you from the house? You came home from work, what happened then?

00:05:12.986 --> 00:05:20.916
Wolf Nehrich: Came back from work. Came the Gestapo with a note saying I was on the list, so I should eh turn myself in, no? At this and that time.

00:05:20.916 --> 00:05:21.534
David Boder: Yes.

00:05:21.534 --> 00:05:22.288
Wolf Nehrich: And I went on my own...

00:05:22.288 --> 00:05:24.474
David Boder: Now hang on. The Gestapo, they were Poles, they were...

00:05:24.474 --> 00:05:26.057
Wolf Nehrich: [interrupts] no Germans. Imperial Germans [orig.: “Reichsdeutsche”]

00:05:26.057 --> 00:05:28.213
David Boder: Imperial Germans came and said...

00:05:28.213 --> 00:05:28.379
Wolf Nehrich: Yes.

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.997
David Boder: . . . you had to...

00:05:28.997 --> 00:05:31.711
Wolf Nehrich: Yes with the list. I must turn myself in at 3 o’clock in the afternoon.

00:05:31.711 --> 00:05:33.415
David Boder: Well? On the next day?

00:05:33.415 --> 00:05:34.425
Wolf Nehrich: On the next day.

00:05:34.425 --> 00:05:34.696
David Boder: Well?

00:05:34.696 --> 00:05:37.410
Wolf Nehrich: And in the mean time I ran away during the night, and I hid.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:37.968
David Boder: When?

00:05:37.968 --> 00:05:39.249
Wolf Nehrich: I hid during the night.

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:39.641
David Boder: Well?

00:05:39.641 --> 00:05:47.963
Wolf Nehrich: And then they searched for me, they were told, were told, I’m not there. I’m in the factory. I wasn’t in my factory either. I hid in the factory in a tank, on top of it.

00:05:47.963 --> 00:05:49.184
David Boder: Oh, you hid in the factory?

00:05:49.184 --> 00:05:49.516
Wolf Nehrich: Yes

00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:49.802
David Boder: Yes

00:05:49.802 --> 00:05:55.410
Wolf Nehrich: And then came, they took my father as hostage. When I don’t turn myself in, they send the father to Auschwitz.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:55.712
David Boder: Well?

00:05:55.712 --> 00:05:57.898
Wolf Nehrich: I was scared then. So I turned myself in.

00:05:57.898 --> 00:05:58.546
David Boder: And the father, did they...

00:05:58.546 --> 00:05:59.903
Wolf Nehrich: [interrupts] then they released the father.

00:05:59.903 --> 00:06:00.174
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:00.174 --> 00:06:01.893
Wolf Nehrich: I later came into an armament camp.

00:06:01.893 --> 00:06:06.069
David Boder: Who told you, that your father was taken hostage?

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:09.612
Wolf Nehrich: The brother came to the factory and said that they had taken the father.

00:06:09.612 --> 00:06:11.255
David Boder: I see. So you came back?

00:06:11.255 --> 00:06:11.798
Wolf Nehrich: Yes.

00:06:11.798 --> 00:06:12.386
David Boder: Well?

00:06:12.386 --> 00:06:14.662
Wolf Nehrich: That was in the year of 1941.

00:06:14.662 --> 00:06:15.265
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:15.265 --> 00:06:30.914
Wolf Nehrich: And then I turned myself in. I went to the police. At the Gestapo they sent me again to in an armament camp, this is in a smaller town. And from there they took us as skilled workers, you know? Was as a carpenter with eleven, with twelve years of age, they took us to, eh, to Germany.

00:06:30.914 --> 00:06:31.411
David Boder: Well?

00:06:31.411 --> 00:06:34.879
Wolf Nehrich: To a camp. There you already started to be forced to work.

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:36.492
David Boder: In which camp was that?

00:06:36.492 --> 00:06:37.276
Wolf Nehrich: Sakrau.

00:06:37.276 --> 00:06:37.924
David Boder: Sakrau.

00:06:37.924 --> 00:06:39.100
Wolf Nehrich: That was the first camp.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.824
David Boder: Where is it?

00:06:39.824 --> 00:06:41.950
Wolf Nehrich: This was in Upper Silesia. German Upper Silesia.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:42.719
David Boder: Yes, well?

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:45.598
Wolf Nehrich: I worked in a forest. Food was scarce.

00:06:45.598 --> 00:06:47.257
David Boder: What did you work there?

00:06:47.257 --> 00:06:49.141
Wolf Nehrich: You cut down trees.

00:06:49.141 --> 00:06:50.257
David Boder: And what did you do?

00:06:50.257 --> 00:06:52.971
Wolf Nehrich: Also cut down trees and carried them to the country road.

00:06:52.971 --> 00:06:55.006
David Boder: Was this with other Jews?

00:06:55.006 --> 00:06:55.790
Wolf Nehrich: Yes. Only Jews.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.991
David Boder: Only Jews, Well, and where...

00:06:57.991 --> 00:06:58.685
Wolf Nehrich: [interrupts] under surveillance.

00:06:58.685 --> 00:06:59.182
David Boder: What?

00:06:59.182 --> 00:07:00.554
Wolf Nehrich: Under surveillance.

00:07:00.554 --> 00:06:59.870
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.188
Wolf Nehrich: Germans kept guard over me.

00:07:01.188 --> 00:07:02.500
David Boder: And where did you sleep?

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.781
Wolf Nehrich: In barracks.

00:07:03.781 --> 00:07:08.123
David Boder: Uh. Well? How long did that last, and what happened then?

00:07:08.123 --> 00:07:20.123
Wolf Nehrich: After this, they took me again in, uh, just thinking how long for. They sent us again as 52 skilled workers to eh, Karwin. That was in Czechia, “Sudetenland.”

00:07:20.123 --> 00:07:20.726
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:20.726 --> 00:07:44.236
Wolf Nehrich: Yes, and there we were, we worked as skilled workers with concrete. We built a power plant. The power plant wasn’t finished yet, when they had to send us away, because there were a lot of guerrillas. They were scared we would flee one after the other, because many fled from the camp. Then they sent us away again to eh, Groß Masselwitz. To another camp. There I stayed again for a while, working.

00:07:44.236 --> 00:07:45.548
David Boder: Masselwitz or Misselwitz?

00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:47.071

00:07:47.071 --> 00:07:47.810
David Boder: Yes, well?

00:07:47.810 --> 00:08:05.373
Wolf Nehrich: In this camp you worked again on eh, new cars for the “Wehrmacht,” again. Building new ones and motorways. This means building the country road. Concrete, all these things. Building new motorways. And there they sent us again, there were already to many people there, and food was scarce, they sent us to Klettendorf.

00:08:05.373 --> 00:08:06.051
David Boder: Where is it?

00:08:06.051 --> 00:08:07.921
Wolf Nehrich: Klettendorf is near Breslau [Polish name: Wroclaw].

00:08:07.921 --> 00:08:08.238
David Boder: Yes.

00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:15.188

00:08:15.188 --> 00:08:15.957
David Boder: I see.

00:08:15.957 --> 00:08:26.856
Wolf Nehrich: Those were these big pipes, you know, we layered earth on. You had to work hard doing it. We made a six kilometer shaft. Two meters five, eh, two meters 20 down you had to...

00:08:26.856 --> 00:08:27.429
David Boder: [interrupts] Dig.

00:08:27.429 --> 00:08:29.269

00:08:29.269 --> 00:08:29.525
David Boder: uh.

00:08:29.525 --> 00:08:33.204
Wolf Nehrich: Those who could do it, could do it, and those who couldn’t were beaten.

00:08:33.204 --> 00:08:35.691
David Boder: Every single one had to dig five meters long and two meters twenty [centimeters] deep?

00:08:35.691 --> 00:08:38.797
Wolf Nehrich: [interrupts] Long and two meters twenty, yes, in one day.

00:08:38.797 --> 00:08:40.440
David Boder: Two meters twenty deep?

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:45.656
Wolf Nehrich: Yes. When it, when it was hard earth or stony, they granted you one more day.

00:08:45.656 --> 00:08:49.516
David Boder: I see. And eh, when it wasn’t finished? What?

00:08:49.516 --> 00:08:58.848
Wolf Nehrich: You got, then you got beaten and maybe sometimes, when somebody had worked even worse, for example, when he was weak, he didn’t get food that day.

00:08:58.848 --> 00:09:04.441
David Boder: I see. Well? Eh, did you always work enough?

00:09:04.441 --> 00:09:13.139
Wolf Nehrich: Yes. I did most times, yes sometimes, when I had good earth it went faster and if not, I got beaten just as much as all the others.

00:09:13.139 --> 00:09:15.371
David Boder: Who was that, who beat you?

00:09:15.371 --> 00:09:16.472
Wolf Nehrich: The foreman himself.

00:09:16.472 --> 00:09:17.512
David Boder: Who is the foreman?

00:09:17.512 --> 00:09:19.562
Wolf Nehrich: The foreman was a German guard, no? A foreman...

00:09:19.562 --> 00:09:20.768
David Boder: [interrupts] Was he prisoner, prisoner?

00:09:20.768 --> 00:09:22.366
Wolf Nehrich: No, no. He was an Imperial German.

00:09:22.366 --> 00:09:24.658
David Boder: And the foreman himself beat you?

00:09:24.658 --> 00:09:25.005
Wolf Nehrich: Yes.

00:09:25.005 --> 00:09:25.925
David Boder: Well?

00:09:25.925 --> 00:09:52.743
Wolf Nehrich: And afterwards eh, we stayed there eh, roughly five months, and then we were sent again to eh Landeshut. We were taken, only eh youths, up until eh 16 years of age, youths. They sent us there. They said we would then work in a weaving mill. Instead we had to work at a building site, too, with stones, carrying clay stones. And we had to erect stone barracks for the bomb, bombed ones from Germany.

00:09:52.743 --> 00:09:53.436
David Boder: Hm.

00:09:53.436 --> 00:10:17.570
Wolf Nehrich: Those, who had been bombed on the French border, those had, were homeless, they had to, they came to barracks we had erected. It was a very bad camp. It was very unclean, and it wasn’t good to sleep in. You had to sleep solely on the earth, one on top of the other. And we, eh, got little to eat. A lot died there, because of hunger and some because of the beatings and because of the dirt. It was various such things, that are unpleasant to speak of.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.304
David Boder: Yes, but we want to know this.

00:10:19.304 --> 00:10:26.374
Wolf Nehrich: Yes, there were lice for example, you see, how to call it, and flees and various other of these elements.

00:10:26.374 --> 00:10:33.490
David Boder: Eh, now tell me how? You say the people died of hunger? How does somebody die of hunger?

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:40.500
Wolf Nehrich: Somebody is eh, sick, you know, when he gets little food, and he has to work hard he gets sick and afterwards.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.098
David Boder: I see, they got sick of their own accord.

00:10:42.098 --> 00:10:42.611
Wolf Nehrich: Yes.

00:10:42.611 --> 00:10:43.139
David Boder: And what did...

00:10:43.139 --> 00:10:51.777
Wolf Nehrich: [interrupts] And when you are ill, when you are unfit for work, you get various injections, such, that you even die. Because they say, who cannot work must, is unfit for work.

00:10:51.777 --> 00:10:55.184
David Boder: I see. Well, did they give injections in your camp?

00:10:55.184 --> 00:11:06.822
Wolf Nehrich: Yes. Injections, it was even SS doctors, who gave petroleum injections. And even if somebody had pus, they took the pus and injected it the sick.

00:11:06.822 --> 00:11:08.417
David Boder: Who had pus?

00:11:08.417 --> 00:11:21.819
Wolf Nehrich: There were some, who had an abscess on the foot or something. They took out the abscess with a syringe and injected somebody else, who was already dying, a syringe with pus, and then he was poisoned and died.

00:11:21.819 --> 00:11:23.688
David Boder: Did you see that yourself?

00:11:23.688 --> 00:11:26.884
Wolf Nehrich: Experienced it myself, saw it, yes.

00:11:26.884 --> 00:11:28.663
David Boder: Where did they do it? At the station?

00:11:28.663 --> 00:11:30.080
Wolf Nehrich: Yes, in the sick ward.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.161
David Boder: And why were you there?

00:11:32.161 --> 00:11:43.664
Wolf Nehrich: That, eh, I came in there now and again. Sometimes you needed a bandage, it was different things. You were [unintelligible word] at the building site, or something hit you, a track, or a stone on the foot or somehow.

00:11:43.664 --> 00:11:44.493
David Boder: Then you came to the station, too?

00:11:44.493 --> 00:11:45.247
Wolf Nehrich: Of course.

00:11:45.247 --> 00:11:47.403
David Boder: And who worked at the station?

00:11:47.403 --> 00:11:51.187
Wolf Nehrich: There were doctors, there were prisoner doctors, you see, and there were eh...

00:11:51.187 --> 00:11:52.227
David Boder: [interrupts] The SS?

00:11:52.227 --> 00:11:55.453
Wolf Nehrich: They were Jewish doctors and they were SS doctors, medical officers.

00:11:55.453 --> 00:11:57.021
David Boder: And who gave the injections?

00:11:57.021 --> 00:11:57.986
Wolf Nehrich: The SS.

00:11:57.986 --> 00:12:01.589
David Boder: The SS gave the injections. Simply taking pus from somebody’s wounds...

00:12:01.589 --> 00:12:01.227
Wolf Nehrich: Yes.

00:12:01.227 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: . . . and injecting it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:12:02.946
Wolf Nehrich: Yes.

00:12:02.946 --> 00:12:05.011
David Boder: Well, go on.

00:12:05.011 --> 00:12:21.594
Wolf Nehrich: After that, they eh sent us from Landeshut. Already were, they organized a transport of 30 sick people, 20 sick people and 30 eh healthy people, who were still fit for work, who were still fit to work were supposed to go to Blechhammer [Polish name: Blachownia Slaska].

00:12:21.594 --> 00:12:22.529
David Boder: To Blechhammer?

00:12:22.529 --> 00:12:22.876
Wolf Nehrich: Yes.

00:12:22.876 --> 00:12:23.464
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:23.464 --> 00:12:24.806
Wolf Nehrich: Well, I went with, with this...

00:12:24.806 --> 00:12:27.565
David Boder: [interrupts] Blechhammer is near which eh camp?

00:12:27.565 --> 00:12:28.846
Wolf Nehrich: Blechhammer is in Upper Silesia, too.

00:12:28.846 --> 00:12:29.615
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:29.615 --> 00:12:49.408
Wolf Nehrich: Well, with, back then I came with the transport to Auschwitz, because I, I was sick too. I was weak, and all. So they sent me to Auschwitz after all. I got there, then they made roll call. And you had to get undressed a bit, half undressed. And a doctor went round and checked who was still fit for work and who wasn’t. I was still deemed fit for work for two weeks.

00:12:49.408 --> 00:12:51.684
David Boder: What does this mean? They still got two weeks...

00:12:51.684 --> 00:13:01.091
Wolf Nehrich: [interrupts] Two weeks working. Those who couldn’t work at all any more, those of course entered through a big gate and came back out through the chimney, this is the crematorium.

00:13:01.091 --> 00:13:02.147
David Boder: [unintelligible]

00:13:02.147 --> 00:13:04.815
Wolf Nehrich: They gassed them, they died in the crematorium.

00:13:04.815 --> 00:13:06.504
David Boder: Did you see the crematories?

00:13:06.504 --> 00:13:07.665
Wolf Nehrich: Yes.

00:13:07.665 --> 00:13:09.037
David Boder: What did they look like?

00:13:09.037 --> 00:13:11.796
Wolf Nehrich: I even have a picture of the crematorium in Buchenwald.

00:13:11.796 --> 00:13:12.143
David Boder: What?

00:13:12.143 --> 00:13:14.661
Wolf Nehrich: I even have a picture of the crem-, one taken at the crematorium in Buchenwald.

00:13:14.661 --> 00:13:15.882
David Boder: Who took the picture?

00:13:15.882 --> 00:13:18.385
Wolf Nehrich: An American, the American soldiers after the liberation.

00:13:18.385 --> 00:13:21.144
David Boder: Yes, but Buchenwald was no extermination camp.

00:13:21.144 --> 00:13:23.270
Wolf Nehrich: It was just like any other camp.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:23.948
David Boder: Why?

00:13:23.948 --> 00:13:42.190
Wolf Nehrich: In Auschwitz the crematorium was a bit bigger than in eh, Buchenwald. They had, in Auschwitz there was gas chamber as well, and in Buchenwald there were no gas chambers. There they hanged. Anyway, I was deemed still clean and fit for work, and so they tattooed a number on my hand.

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:43.773
David Boder: Which number where you?

00:13:43.773 --> 00:13:46.502
Wolf Nehrich: 178141

00:13:46.502 --> 00:13:48.326
David Boder: one hundred seventy eight

00:13:48.326 --> 00:13:50.557
Wolf Nehrich: eight, one thousand, you see, hundred

00:13:50.557 --> 00:13:51.462
David Boder: one hundred...

00:13:51.462 --> 00:13:52.140
Wolf Nehrich: forty...

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:52.532
David Boder: . . . one

00:13:52.532 --> 00:13:53.889
Wolf Nehrich: . . . forty one.

00:13:53.889 --> 00:13:55.035
David Boder: one hundred forty one.

00:13:55.035 --> 00:13:55.653
Wolf Nehrich: Yes.

00:13:55.653 --> 00:13:58.125
David Boder: And a triangle, no triangle?

00:13:58.125 --> 00:13:58.638
Wolf Nehrich: No.

00:13:58.638 --> 00:14:00.025
David Boder: Ah, 141.

00:14:00.025 --> 00:14:00.522
Wolf Nehrich: Yes.

00:14:00.522 --> 00:14:02.000
David Boder: Who did the tattoos?

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.598
Wolf Nehrich: It was prisoners, who were especially eh, picked for these things.

00:14:06.598 --> 00:14:07.065
David Boder: Yes

00:14:07.065 --> 00:14:07.910
Wolf Nehrich: To tattoo.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:08.799
Wolf Nehrich: And then they...

00:14:08.799 --> 00:14:09.975
David Boder: [interrupts] And how did they tattoo?

00:14:09.975 --> 00:14:18.840
Wolf Nehrich: It was a kind of quill, you know, like for an injection, and in the quill was a needle, like an injection needle, and they eh filled it with ink, and it doesn’t come off again.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.187
David Boder: I see.

00:14:19.187 --> 00:15:01.368
Wolf Nehrich: It stays for a while. The arm [unintelligible ending of sentence]. And then they did, eh, because I was fit for work, they did not leave me in Auschwitz. I did not, I didn’t work. You only ever had to do such useless work, carrying stones from one place to the next, eh, tidying up and various things. And you had to stand a few hours during roll call every morning, and every night they woke us up, and afterwards they sent me to eh Blechhammer, too. I came to Blechhammer, they had me, I went onto a building site, where there was a big plant, eh, there they produced gasoline. Coal was dug there. Gasoline was extracted from the coal, and eh, a substance for margarine and a substance for saccharin. The rest was coke.

00:15:01.368 --> 00:15:03.162
David Boder: What is a substance for margarine?

00:15:03.162 --> 00:15:05.800
Wolf Nehrich: What was extracted from the coal, a kind of substance...

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.247
David Boder: [interrupts] a substance margarine is made out of?

00:15:07.247 --> 00:15:11.348
Wolf Nehrich: [interrupts] Yes, margarine and also a kind of substance you make saccharin out of.

00:15:11.348 --> 00:15:12.599
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:12.599 --> 00:15:18.117
Wolf Nehrich: Afterwards, there you, I worked with tracks, railway construction.

00:15:18.117 --> 00:15:18.494
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:18.494 --> 00:15:28.338
Wolf Nehrich: And that was a work, eh that was very hard. We had to work at piece-rate, unloading every day four, five coaches with tracks and crossties additionally.

00:15:28.338 --> 00:15:29.605
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:29.605 --> 00:15:41.620
Wolf Nehrich: And we always loaded the coaches. There were many accidents, because they chased us, we hard to work a lot. The foremen were always screaming, we had to work for the empire, for the Führer, and for the plant [orig.: “für Reich, für Führer und für Werk”] And when...

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.278
David Boder: [interrupts] For the empire, for the Führer...

00:15:43.278 --> 00:15:44.394
Wolf Nehrich: For the Führer and for the plant.

00:15:44.394 --> 00:15:45.856
David Boder: . . . and for the plant. And?

00:15:45.856 --> 00:15:51.947
Wolf Nehrich: We didn’t want to do it, just as we didn’t want to do anything, I know, that wasn’t needed.

00:15:51.947 --> 00:15:52.444
David Boder: No.

00:15:52.444 --> 00:16:09.902
Wolf Nehrich: Anyway, we had to do it. And eh, towards the end the plant was bombed much, very heavily, and so, eh, after half a year working there, on a coach, there was an air raid by American planes, and they bombed the entire plant.

00:16:09.902 --> 00:16:10.580
David Boder: Mhm.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:18.450
Wolf Nehrich: And I, eh, a lot, we were never allowed to protect us, trenches against splinters. So I protected myself beneath a, a stack of crossties. And as I...

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:19.159
David Boder: [interrupts] a stack of what?

00:16:19.159 --> 00:16:20.169
Wolf Nehrich: Of crossties.

00:16:20.169 --> 00:16:20.531
David Boder: Crossties?

00:16:20.531 --> 00:16:21.028
Wolf Nehrich: Crossties, yes. Railway crossties.

00:16:21.028 --> 00:16:21.662
David Boder: [speaks simultaneously with Nehrich] Railway crossties.

00:16:21.662 --> 00:16:29.607
Wolf Nehrich: Yes. And all of a sudden, a couple of bombs fell. I protected myself a little, against the splinters, against the bombs you couldn’t protect yourself.

00:16:29.607 --> 00:16:30.828
David Boder: Yes.

00:16:30.828 --> 00:17:01.658
Wolf Nehrich: Then, eh, a bomb fell, eh a bomb about one and a half meters, about one and a half to two meters away from me. And everything went up in the air, including me. When I came back to earth, I was already unconscious, as I flew up I wanted to scream [unintelligible word], but I couldn’t scream do it anymore, because I was already unconscious. I fell down into a hole, where the, a bomb had already landed, a bomb crater. And afterwards I lay down there, unconscious, the hole was closed again by another bomb.

00:17:01.658 --> 00:17:02.322
David Boder: Well?

00:17:02.322 --> 00:17:11.503
Wolf Nehrich: Was closed again by another bomb, and I was beneath the earth, about two meters. I didn’t know at all, whether I would be able to somehow get out from down there. There were...

00:17:11.503 --> 00:17:13.538
David Boder: [interrupts] Yes, the earth was completely on top of you?

00:17:13.538 --> 00:17:21.950
Wolf Nehrich: On top of me. Entire stones with various. I lay down there, I don’t know, maybe it was too deep, maybe it was damp, there was a bit of air. I lay down there one hour.

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:22.372
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:22.372 --> 00:17:35.708
Wolf Nehrich: Then, next to me, eh they were maybe ten meters away in a trench against splinters; there were prisoners of war, English and French. The protected themselves there, because they were no, eh, not under the SS, guarded only by the Wehrmacht. They saw how I...

00:17:35.708 --> 00:17:37.517
David Boder: [interrupts] The French and English were under the Wehrmacht?

00:17:37.517 --> 00:17:37.789
Wolf Nehrich: Under the Wehrmacht.

00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:38.920
David Boder: [speaks over Nehrich] They could protect themselves.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:39.026
Wolf Nehrich: Yes.

00:17:39.026 --> 00:17:39.463
David Boder: Well?

00:17:39.463 --> 00:17:55.925
Wolf Nehrich: And they saw how I flew in the air, after the raid they wanted to search for me. Because they were, we always lived as comrades together on the building site. They searched for me, and luckily they found me after one hour underneath the earth. And the right upper arm was broken.

00:17:55.925 --> 00:17:56.559
David Boder: Well?

00:17:56.559 --> 00:18:15.388
Wolf Nehrich: After that they brought me to, to the camp. They had to carry me, and the people didn’t have strength back then, because about 75, roughly 75 or 76 dead on that day. And over 200 eh wounded. I was amongst them, too. So they didn’t even have the strength to carry me onto the building site, they had to drag me on the earth.

00:18:15.388 --> 00:18:17.469
David Boder: Why? They had no strength?

00:18:17.469 --> 00:18:24.961
Wolf Nehrich: No, they didn’t have strength, they carried me a little and the dragged me on the earth a little and various. We didn’t have no car, nothing. Couldn’t...

00:18:24.961 --> 00:18:26.680
David Boder: [interrupts] How far was it?

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.851
Wolf Nehrich: Three quarters of an hour from the building site on foot...

00:18:28.851 --> 00:18:29.469
David Boder: Yes.

00:18:29.469 --> 00:18:43.007
Wolf Nehrich: . . . into the camp. Afterwards we came near the camp, already ten minutes away from the camp, a car passed, and an SS man stopped and threw us into the car. And they brought me into a, into the camp by car.

00:18:43.007 --> 00:18:43.173
David Boder: Yes.

00:18:43.173 --> 00:19:44.890
Wolf Nehrich: Then I came into the sick ward. They, they tried to fix my arm somehow. They, it was only cracked in one, eh, two places, you know, broken through, so they put it back into a joint, the way it had been, and they searched for plaster, to do a bit more. The doctor at the moment was a Polish Jew, he was very decent in this camp, and said, because I was still young, he said, he would save me somehow with this, and he made me a cast, that, eh, I had the cast for three weeks. It should have stayed six weeks on the hand, on the arm, because, it stayed only three weeks, because it was filthy there in the barracks, the bugs crawled underneath and then bit, that I couldn’t stand it anymore, so the doctor took the cast off after three weeks. I didn’t have the cast anymore, it was only a, a roll of bandage, a packet of bandage, so he made me a strong bandage and I had it for three more weeks. But afterwards the arm didn’t grow together straight, it is a little bent.

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:46.579
David Boder: And it is still bent?

00:19:46.579 --> 00:19:48.855
Wolf Nehrich: Not very much. Of course, a little.

00:19:48.855 --> 00:19:50.845
David Boder: Yes. Where was it broke?

00:19:50.845 --> 00:19:52.051
Wolf Nehrich: Here at the top.

00:19:52.051 --> 00:19:52.654
David Boder: I see.

00:19:52.654 --> 00:20:04.021
Wolf Nehrich: Here, at this spot. And afterwards, eh, I should, rightfully I should only stay four days in the sick ward. Because if you are in the sick ward that long, you don’t get food there, you are unfit for work.

00:20:04.021 --> 00:20:05.348
David Boder: Sick ward you call it, yes?

00:20:05.348 --> 00:20:20.830
Wolf Nehrich: Yes. That’s the “Revier.” And afterwards they send you to Auschwitz, when you are unable, unfit for work and you end up in the crematorium. But the doctor eh, he liked me, and so, every time the medical officer came, came from Auschwitz to check.

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:21.976
David Boder: Mhm, well?

00:20:21.976 --> 00:20:31.763
Wolf Nehrich: When he came, he said, they hid me in a chamber or somewhere, so that the medical officer wouldn’t see me, that I stayed that long.

00:20:31.763 --> 00:20:32.486
David Boder: And?

00:20:32.486 --> 00:20:57.826
Wolf Nehrich: And, eh, when the medical officer came, the doctor said, I was already at the building site, and so I was still there after the six weeks, they took of half the cast, and eh, I, the doctor had to give me the massage. Hand massage. With Vaseline and so on, to make the arm straight again, because it was stiff from the dress-, from the cast.

00:20:57.826 --> 00:20:59.152
David Boder: Well?

00:20:59.152 --> 00:22:22.889
Wolf Nehrich: Then I worked, in the mean time, in the sick ward with the doctor, assisting variously, boiling out the instruments and various things. He realized, I knew these things a little, I was able to do various things. And sometimes I stood with operations, because the doctor saw, it doesn’t bother me much, when I stand with operations. It was various amputations of the finger, and eh cutting various abscesses and phlegmons. And afterwards there came, that was already 1944, end of, eh near the end already. In December, at the end of December. Afterwards it was already cold in December. There were a lot of sick people in the sick ward, so I had to go back to the building site. I came to the building site, I worked, because, in a building that had been bombed, the machines had to be taken out, the machines that had been in the building had to be pulled out of the rubble, where it was bombed. Afterwards, it was on the 21st of January 1945 the Russians, the Russian army was six kilometers away from the camp. And it was very dangerous, so they evacuated us, so the Russians would not meet us, us alive in the camp. 4300 men were evacuated on that occasion. How far and where we would walk we didn’t know. We didn’t get no food. We didn’t know how long we would walk. We had to [unintelligible word]...

00:22:22.889 --> 00:22:24.166
David Boder: You marched?

00:22:24.166 --> 00:22:24.799
Wolf Nehrich: Yes.

00:22:24.799 --> 00:22:25.383
David Boder: Well?

00:22:25.383 --> 00:22:25.654
Wolf Nehrich: When...

00:22:25.654 --> 00:22:29.660
David Boder: [interrupts] Tell me more about the march, and what happened on the way.

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:50.864
Wolf Nehrich: Yes. We came out on the 21st of January 1945, and we walked throughout the whole time. There was snow; we walked over mountains and through fields. We were not allowed to walk along the country road, because it was, eh, the Wehrmacht retreated at that time. So the country roads where all blocked, so we had to take various back roads...

00:22:50.864 --> 00:22:51.509
David Boder: [interrupts] And who led you?

00:22:51.509 --> 00:23:17.075
Wolf Nehrich: Food we didn’t get. There were guards every few meters, five, six meters there was an SS man, and on the guns stuck bayonets. And we walked, in a few, few hours others fell, because of the frost and the cold and so on. We didn’t have anything to drink, and they didn’t give us any food. They simply evacuated us. They wanted to see who would last, and those who won’t hold out, will hold out, who will not, doesn’t have luck on his side.

00:23:17.075 --> 00:23:20.449
David Boder: And what did they do with those who didn’t hold out?

00:23:20.449 --> 00:23:26.877
Wolf Nehrich: They were eh, taken out of the rows and were thrown into the field, snow and on top with the snow and that was it all.

00:23:26.877 --> 00:23:28.997
David Boder: Yes, but when they were not yet dead?

00:23:28.997 --> 00:23:47.823
Wolf Nehrich: Then they were left there. Or they were, some who would last a while longer, eh, would last a few hours, were shot and were thrown on top, and those would die soon where thrown on top of the snow and then they died on, in the snow.

00:23:47.823 --> 00:23:48.437
David Boder: Mhm.

00:23:48.437 --> 00:23:55.456
Wolf Nehrich: And, eh, you had to drink something there. So we want, wanted to drink snow, then the SS men said, we weren’t allowed to.

00:23:55.456 --> 00:23:56.432
David Boder: Why?

00:23:56.432 --> 00:23:59.065
Wolf Nehrich: Because we would become sick from the snow.

00:23:59.065 --> 00:23:59.740
David Boder: Well?

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:09.511
Wolf Nehrich: They, first they shoot us with various things, and then they’re afraid all of a sudden, we would become sick. But they didn’t care for us, they thought it would be worse if we couldn’t drink a little.

00:24:09.511 --> 00:24:10.656
David Boder: Mhm.

00:24:10.656 --> 00:24:11.692
Wolf Nehrich: Afterwards we...

00:24:11.692 --> 00:24:15.819
David Boder: [interrupts] And what did the SS men eat and drink? They had something with them, didn’t they?

00:24:15.819 --> 00:24:19.807
Wolf Nehrich: They always bought provisions from one village to the next.

00:24:19.807 --> 00:24:21.084
David Boder: I see.

00:24:21.084 --> 00:25:20.245
Wolf Nehrich: And if not, they. I once tried, tried to flee on the way. I got away into a village during the night, into a barn. And in the, in this barn I crawled into a straw and I thought, I would be all alone. I was hungry, that was already on the eighth or ninth day. The farmer came when I was there. I told him I was a German, I, we were bombed, I said, and, because I didn’t want to say that I was a Jew, that I was with the evacuated. So I said, we were bombed and everybody ran away somewhere, and I went into this barn, he should bring me something to eat. He brought me food, bread, you know, and something cooked. And all of a sudden four SS men enter the barn. He went off, back into his room, and I stayed under this straw, I even couldn’t eat anything, because I was afraid. And the SS men start to strike the straw and search if somebody’s there. They searched for the Jews in one barn after the other, whether somebody stayed behind.

00:25:20.245 --> 00:25:21.884
David Boder: Mhm.

00:25:21.884 --> 00:25:34.366
Wolf Nehrich: Well, they started to strike. The bayonet went through my hand, beside this hand. I became scared I would get the next strike, so I threw off the heap with the straw and came out.

00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:34.950
David Boder: Mhm.

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:57.179
Wolf Nehrich: SS men soon positioned themselves in front of me with the guns. And, ehm, they said: Get out! How many are you. I said: I’m on my own. Says he: You’re lying. Says I: But, I’m here, I think, I’m here on my own. They continued searching, they found seven more. The seven didn’t know I was there, and I didn’t know the seven were there. Fortunately they were drunk and they...

00:25:57.179 --> 00:25:57.902
David Boder: [interrupts] the SS were drunk.

00:25:57.902 --> 00:25:58.203
Wolf Nehrich: Yes. They were drunk.

00:25:58.203 --> 00:25:59.218
David Boder: [speaks over Nehrich] Not you were drunk.

00:25:59.218 --> 00:26:28.640
Wolf Nehrich: No. The SS men were drunk. And so they didn’t know what to do, because at that moment they told us: What shall we do with you? And we want to say they should let us live, so they want to say: Don’t give us orders. We want to say: Do what ever you want, then they would want to simply shoot us. We didn’t answer. Did they say to us: Come on, back into line. And we had to run after them the whole bit, they had already walked on, eh, slowly. We had to run after them through all the snow and over the mountains until we got back to the line.

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.194
David Boder: I see.

00:26:29.194 --> 00:26:30.158
Wolf Nehrich: I already...

00:26:30.158 --> 00:26:32.718
David Boder: [interrupts] Where the SS men from your transport?

00:26:32.718 --> 00:26:39.104
Wolf Nehrich: Yes. The SS men were from our Jews. Four, five SS men always stayed there in order to search whether somebody had stayed behind here.

00:26:39.104 --> 00:26:39.929
David Boder: I see.

00:26:39.929 --> 00:26:43.514
Wolf Nehrich: You walked through the fields; afterwards you came into a village.

00:26:43.514 --> 00:26:47.321
David Boder: They simply let you run. They said to collect at night with the transport.

00:26:47.321 --> 00:26:51.177
Wolf Nehrich: Yes, they followed in a motorized convoy, we had to run on foot.

00:26:51.177 --> 00:26:52.936
David Boder: I see. Well?

00:26:52.936 --> 00:27:03.840
Wolf Nehrich: And eh, afterwards we eh walked, that was, that was, was already a few days later after I had fled. So, during one of the nights we arrived in Groß-Rosen [Polish name: Rogoznica].

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:04.846
David Boder: Groß-Rosen is where?

00:27:04.846 --> 00:27:08.521
Wolf Nehrich: Groß-Rosen, it is near [maybe “Greuslitz” / unclear place name], it is not far from Breslau as well...

00:27:08.521 --> 00:27:09.045
David Boder: Yes.

00:27:09.045 --> 00:27:45.209
Wolf Nehrich: . . . roughly, we went there. It eh is near Schweidnitz [Polish name: Świdnica], this area we went to afterwards, it was a big camp too, a very bad camp. There were many prisoners, the German prisoners of war eh, the professional criminals and dangerous criminals, those, who already had been in concentration camps for ten and twelve years for murder and the like. They were all Germans. And they beat us when we came in. First we got 80 “deka” [i.e., “dekagram”] for twelve men back then. So everybody got one, got one bite, as we came in.

00:27:45.209 --> 00:27:48.203
David Boder: This means, everybody took a bite from the same bread?

00:27:48.203 --> 00:27:50.233
Wolf Nehrich: No, they gave us one loaf of bread for twelve men.

00:27:50.233 --> 00:27:51.558
David Boder: And how did you share it out?

00:27:51.558 --> 00:27:55.083
Wolf Nehrich: And you took a knife, everybody got one little piece and that was all.

00:27:55.083 --> 00:27:56.691
David Boder: Who had the knife?

00:27:56.691 --> 00:28:01.812
Wolf Nehrich: We got them. They lent us one knife for every twelve men for cutting and took it back soon.

00:28:01.812 --> 00:28:02.216
David Boder: I see.

00:28:02.216 --> 00:28:30.838
Wolf Nehrich: You had to give back the knife soon. Afterwards they chased us inside. You couldn’t sleep well. There were already evacuated from different transports, they had come there into the camp. So they told us to walk above all things during the night. Straight down these stairs, and we didn’t know where we were going. It was dark. You weren’t allowed to have lighting outside because of the air raids. We should have gone right, instead they told us to left, and left there was a heap of feces a whole square, and we stepped into the feces up over the knees. We couldn’t get out at all.

00:28:30.838 --> 00:28:31.712
David Boder: What kind of feces?

00:28:31.712 --> 00:28:37.748
Wolf Nehrich: Feces. Simply. Brought from fields from different places, eh, from sand, made wet with clay and that.

00:28:37.748 --> 00:28:38.200
David Boder: Yes.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:29:09.714
Wolf Nehrich: And you could up over the knees. And it was winter then, of course. It was, it was freezing and that. It was cold after all. Many froze off their feet, the toes and so on. Afterwards they eh they hit us, so that we would get out of the dirt into the barracks into this hall. But you couldn’t walk fast, because you couldn’t get out of these feces that quickly after all. But you had to, those who could, got out, and those who couldn’t stayed put, lying in the feces until in the morning and perhaps were frozen to death when found.

00:29:09.714 --> 00:29:10.389
David Boder: Mhm.

00:29:10.389 --> 00:29:32.811
Wolf Nehrich: I too went into the hall. Because, eh, I somehow found a way to get out of the dirt, I tormented myself long enough. Then I went into the hall and lay down on the earth. Came in the camp eldest, an Imperial German, he was with a, such a green triangle [Note: he uses the German word “Winkel,” literally “angle.” In the Third Reich, a “Winkel” was the term for the color coded concentration camp identification badges, usually triangular. Therefore, “Winkel” is translated as “triangle.”] It was red triangle on the left chest, was a political...

00:29:32.811 --> 00:29:33.275
David Boder: [interrupts] political

00:29:33.275 --> 00:29:35.420
Wolf Nehrich: Yes, and green triangle criminal.

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:36.161
David Boder: Mhm.

00:29:36.161 --> 00:29:50.661
Wolf Nehrich: There was also, eh, black triangle: sabotage. It was a green triangle, he told us: everybody ou-, over to that side. The whole hall was crammed, that you couldn’t move and he told us to go to one side. So, you couldn’t, he beat us. And then...

00:29:50.661 --> 00:29:51.715
David Boder: [interrupts] What did he hit you with?

00:29:51.715 --> 00:29:53.161
Wolf Nehrich: With a riding crop.

00:29:53.161 --> 00:29:54.336
David Boder: Oh, he had a riding crop?

00:29:54.336 --> 00:29:54.830
Wolf Nehrich: Yes.

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:55.324
David Boder: Well.

00:29:55.324 --> 00:30:18.167
Wolf Nehrich: Then he said: if you can [unintelligible sentence part], then everybody out, and we had to stand until the morning. So outside during the roll call, you counted the whole day. So three, four days we were there. We didn’t work, we just collected dead people who lay on the square. And the ones frozen to death in the dirt, you had to mark them with a number, write it onto their feet, very big and then into the crematorium.

00:30:18.167 --> 00:30:19.282
David Boder: What with?

00:30:19.282 --> 00:30:20.228
Wolf Nehrich: With an ink pencil.

00:30:20.228 --> 00:30:20.873
David Boder: What?

00:30:20.873 --> 00:30:22.060
Wolf Nehrich: With an ink pencil.

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:23.488
David Boder: With an ink pencil.

00:30:23.488 --> 00:30:23.952
Wolf Nehrich: Yes.

00:30:23.952 --> 00:30:24.898
David Boder: You wrote the number onto them.

00:30:24.898 --> 00:30:50.629
Wolf Nehrich: Yes. The number he had on the arm or on the trousers, you know, it has to be written onto the bones when they were undressed. Everybody was skinny after all, so you could write onto the bones. Then they were taken into the crematorium. After four days they said we would move on. We didn’t know where to, they led us with, into railway cars, we were 100 men in one car. They, eh, cars for animals. And two sentinels are in this car.

00:30:50.629 --> 00:30:51.304
David Boder: Two soldiers?

00:30:51.304 --> 00:30:54.659
Wolf Nehrich: Two sentinels. Yes, they were the two SS men. Armed.

00:30:54.659 --> 00:30:56.045
David Boder: In the car as well?

00:30:56.045 --> 00:31:00.033
Wolf Nehrich: Yes. But they took up a quarter of the car the two, and we the three quarters.

00:31:00.033 --> 00:31:02.967
David Boder: Why did they take up a quarter of the car? What did they do?

00:31:02.967 --> 00:31:08.250
Wolf Nehrich: They, they were Germans, after all, they said, we don’t want to knock against you here. We have to have it a little more comfortable.

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:09.184
David Boder: So what did they do?

00:31:09.184 --> 00:31:16.515
Wolf Nehrich: So they took a quarter of the car, parted it with a plank, you know. And up to this plank we were allowed and not further.

00:31:16.515 --> 00:31:16.997
David Boder: Well.

00:31:16.997 --> 00:31:22.118
Wolf Nehrich: And we lay like that one top of the other. We drove for four days all in all. On the 9th of Feb-, eh.

00:31:22.118 --> 00:31:25.895
David Boder: How did you go outside if you needed to, to the toilet or so?

00:31:25.895 --> 00:31:45.383
Wolf Nehrich: Yes, then they stopped, and eh you couldn’t go all the way as well. A few times the train stopped, the pathways were always variously bombed. You had to stop. Then single people had to go outside, whoever needed to, always alone. And first of all we got 15 deka a day. 15 deka bread a day and then a black coffee.

00:31:45.383 --> 00:31:46.829
David Boder: Mhm.

00:31:46.829 --> 00:31:49.612
Wolf Nehrich: We arrived on the 9th of April we arrived on...

00:31:49.612 --> 00:31:50.215
David Boder: 45.

00:31:50.215 --> 00:31:55.046
Wolf Nehrich: On the 9th of February 45 we arrived in Weimar. It is near Buchenwald.

00:31:55.046 --> 00:31:56.462
David Boder: Mhm.

00:31:56.462 --> 00:32:09.366
Wolf Nehrich: So as we, eh some of the car were no freight cars or the like, but for work cars for bricks and such, entirely open. Eh, as we arrived in Weimar at about eleven at twelve o’clock the raid came.

00:32:09.366 --> 00:32:10.011
David Boder: [speaks over Nehrich] At night?

00:32:10.011 --> 00:33:10.484
Wolf Nehrich: No, during the day. Midday. Came an air raid. First a scout, an American plane signaled that everywhere at the station there was military. And after five minutes later, there soon came a whole, a whole air raid and they bombed us. And the sentinels here had to get us down, and the sentinels wanted to protect themselves. The sentinels ran out of the coach, did they see that there is military and they bombed us. A lot at that time, I was at that time [unintelligible word] in the knee here, I still have something here a mark, already the second time by a bomb. The hands I got splinters, into the hands, too, and eh a lot of dead, some were, were eh, you couldn’t find them anymore. Only bits of them. And there were also two SS men eh dead. Of all the SS men only two. And because the two were dead, they beat us afterwards, because they said: your American comrades bombed us.

00:33:10.484 --> 00:33:11.791
David Boder: Your American comrades.

00:33:11.791 --> 00:33:30.677
Wolf Nehrich: Comrades shot us two eh, killed our two comrades. Afterwards we had to go back to roll call. All proper, stayed alive. Of all of them, of all the 4300 men who got out of Blechhammer 1200 were left over until Buchenwald.

00:33:30.677 --> 00:33:31.171
David Boder: Mhm.

00:33:31.171 --> 00:33:32.569
Wolf Nehrich: We came back to Buchenwald at night.

00:33:32.569 --> 00:33:33.846
David Boder: [speaks over Nehrich] All men?

00:33:33.846 --> 00:33:39.328
Wolf Nehrich: Yes. No, women also came with us, but the women went somewhere else afterwards from Groß Rosen.

00:33:39.328 --> 00:33:40.292
David Boder: Mhm.

00:33:40.292 --> 00:33:49.280
Wolf Nehrich: Well, afterwards we came, 1200 men, into Buchenwald at night. Because we first had to walk three-, thirteen kilometers on foot.

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:49.864
David Boder: Mhm.

00:33:49.864 --> 00:34:12.786
Wolf Nehrich: To, eh from Weimar to Buchenwald. We got there at night; they brought us into a kind of wash room. There the bathed us. They took away all our clothes we had worn. They only gave us back prisoner’s trousers, other ones, which were newly laundered. Eh, freshly laundered, they were clean. And a jacket and a shirt. And a cap, some kind of prisoner’s cap. Without underpants, just like that.

00:34:12.786 --> 00:34:13.509
David Boder: Mhm.

00:34:13.509 --> 00:34:40.791
Wolf Nehrich: They brought us into big barracks, a horse stable, stable barracks. There we sat for a long time. Until they brought us in again a little soup. In Buchenwald there were already, came green triangles, such as Capos, and such. They were, uh, most people were Russians. They were also French, Czech, various. There were nationalities prisoners there from all over Europe, which took part in the war.

00:34:40.791 --> 00:34:42.146
David Boder: Yes.

00:34:42.146 --> 00:35:23.905
Wolf Nehrich: Well, afterwards I stayed there for two weeks in Buchenwald. We got to eat very little, too. Therefore they also gave us injections against typhus. We had to sleep on the barracks, eh sleep in the barracks on pallets. Eleven people had one and a half meters. One with the head and one the feet like that and diagonally across various, however you could. A lot died there of typhus illnesses and pneumonia. I lay with them all, and I don’t know, somehow a miracle, I wasn’t, I didn’t have anything wrong with me. I didn’t have anything wrong with me. Afterwards, afterwards they sent us to eh, Hannover as eh, skilled workers. I was, I was still young, but...

00:35:23.905 --> 00:35:24.550
David Boder: [interrupts] You were a carpenter.

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:27.122
Wolf Nehrich: Yes, carpenter. They sent me to Hannover. Into a big...

00:35:27.122 --> 00:35:27.996
David Boder: [interrupts] To Hannover?

00:35:27.996 --> 00:35:37.707
Wolf Nehrich: Yes. They sent us in a transport, eh 200 men from Buchenwald came to Hannover into an aircraft factory, and V2 was built there.

00:35:37.707 --> 00:35:38.713
David Boder: Yes.

00:35:38.713 --> 00:35:45.671
Wolf Nehrich: There we worked in the plant that was underneath the earth. 15 me-, 50 meters underneath the earth in a plant it was...

00:35:45.671 --> 00:35:47.069
David Boder: [interrupts] And, in Hannover.

00:35:47.069 --> 00:35:47.232
Wolf Nehrich: Yes.

00:35:47.232 --> 00:35:48.238
David Boder: A plant underneath the earth?

00:35:48.238 --> 00:36:07.033
Wolf Nehrich: Yes. And there we built, you know, the aircrafts, eh, produced them. We didn’t build them alone, but we had to unload the parts for them and assemble them and cut the aluminum for the V2 with scissors, with mechanic scissors, all that we had to do. Hard work with these things.

00:36:07.033 --> 00:36:08.569
David Boder: Only Jews?

00:36:08.569 --> 00:36:14.811
Wolf Nehrich: No, there were also Italians and there were Jews, There were other nationalities, too from different countries...

00:36:14.811 --> 00:36:16.450
David Boder: [interrupts with an unintelligible question]

00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:26.974
Wolf Nehrich: No. Those were not. There were French, Czech, Yugoslavs, Italians and Poles and Austrians and Germans, too. From various nationalities.

00:36:26.974 --> 00:36:28.269
David Boder: Mhm.

00:36:28.269 --> 00:36:46.134
Wolf Nehrich: Afterwards, eh, there was a hall, where Jews were not allowed there. It was only for eh for Imperial Germans. There they designed the plans, and there were machines which put together the V2 quickly and screwed in, put in the dynamite into the V2.

00:36:46.134 --> 00:36:47.712
David Boder: Where those prisoners there as well?

00:36:47.712 --> 00:36:51.206
Wolf Nehrich: No. There only the Imperial Germans, who were higher up, higher up professionals, were allowed...

00:36:51.206 --> 00:36:51.779
David Boder: [interrupts] In.

00:36:51.779 --> 00:37:19.574
Wolf Nehrich: . . . to come in. Once a eh, a foreman, it was an Imperial German, he had to bring in a big plate of aluminum into this, into this room where the Jews were not allowed, and he told me to come, too. I showed him the sign: it says there on the sign, eh, I pointed with my hand that there is a sign put up: only for Imperial Germans. Jews keep out!

00:37:19.574 --> 00:37:20.899
David Boder: Mhm.

00:37:20.899 --> 00:37:32.225
Wolf Nehrich: So he said, eh, so he signals with his hand, looks at me: come, nobody will see. The sentinel was just turned the other way.

00:37:32.225 --> 00:37:37.809
David Boder: [In English] Spool Number 76. Wolf Nehrich continues the interview.

00:37:37.809 --> 00:37:40.912
David Boder: [In German] Well, where were you?

00:37:40.912 --> 00:37:43.966
Wolf Nehrich: Well, I took in with me the plate of this aluminum.

00:37:43.966 --> 00:37:44.358
David Boder: Yes.

00:37:44.358 --> 00:38:34.688
Wolf Nehrich: Eh, into this, into this room where Jews were not allowed. And I walk past through a machine where, eh, a big machine, you know, and I wanted to do something, to, do a bit of sabotage, without anybody spotting me doing it. I unscrewed the one, only one bolt and nut and went away from there again. Nobody saw me doing it. I did it in this room, because Jews were not allowed in there, and then it would be clear, if something happens then only the Imperial Germans are guilty and not us. Nobody gets the damage except them. And eh, it was guarded severely, and if they don’t see me I’ll be successful. And I only unscrewed one bolt and nut and pushed it away with the foot. Afterwards I went outside. Two days the machine worked, and during the second day, already near closing time, you hear a huge crash, the machine collapses.

00:38:34.688 --> 00:38:35.272
David Boder: Well.

00:38:35.272 --> 00:39:02.489
Wolf Nehrich: They didn’t know who had done it. They wanted to investigate, but the foremen themselves didn’t want to investigate, because they thought, it was their fault. But nobody was allowed to say this. This foreman, who had taken me inside, wanted, knew, perhaps he realized that it was me, who did it. But he was scared to say so, because it was him, who had called me inside. He hadn’t been allowed to. If he says something, then they take me, and they take him, too. Himself. That’s why he didn’t say anything. And it already didn’t make a difference for them anymore, the Germans, because they knew, they would be game over soon.

00:39:02.489 --> 00:39:03.796
David Boder: They knew that?

00:39:03.796 --> 00:39:04.188
Wolf Nehrich: Yes.

00:39:04.188 --> 00:39:08.116
David Boder: Well, how did they, did that show? That they knew?

00:39:08.116 --> 00:39:08.941
Wolf Nehrich: What?

00:39:08.941 --> 00:39:10.146
David Boder: Eh, how...

00:39:10.146 --> 00:39:11.200
Wolf Nehrich: [interrupts] That they had lost?

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:11.893
David Boder: Yes.

00:39:11.893 --> 00:39:25.447
Wolf Nehrich: They saw the American front slowly coming closer. Already they were not far from Hannover and always nearer. Two days after I had done that they already brought us back to Buchenwald, because there was the Americ-, the American front.

00:39:25.447 --> 00:39:26.652
David Boder: Who brought you back to Buchenwald?

00:39:26.652 --> 00:39:32.196
Wolf Nehrich: The Germans. The SS brought us, just as they brought us from Buchenwald to Hannover, they brought us back again to Buchenwald...

00:39:32.196 --> 00:39:33.281
David Boder: [interrupts] By train or on foot?

00:39:33.281 --> 00:39:34.739
Wolf Nehrich: In the coach. Only train.

00:39:34.739 --> 00:39:36.317
David Boder: They took to, to Buchenwald.

00:39:36.317 --> 00:39:36.468
Wolf Nehrich: Yes.

00:39:36.468 --> 00:39:36.872
David Boder: And, what was there?

00:39:36.872 --> 00:39:49.986
Wolf Nehrich: Yes. We came back to Buchenwald. There they had evacuated again an entire transport. It was said evacuation to Theresienstadt, but they took them into a tent of the camp, in an, eh, forest and they shot them all.

00:39:49.986 --> 00:39:51.191
David Boder: How do you know this?

00:39:51.191 --> 00:39:59.444
Wolf Nehrich: Because after the liberation we, we saw them, that. We afterwards, the poor dead where in bags, and they afterwards were brought into the camp, and they were buried.

00:39:59.444 --> 00:40:02.004
David Boder: Were they buried in Buchenwald?

00:40:02.004 --> 00:40:03.330
Wolf Nehrich: Yes. Well, next to the camp.

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:03.824
David Boder: Yes.

00:40:03.824 --> 00:40:05.523
Wolf Nehrich: There was a big cemetery made after the liberation.

00:40:05.523 --> 00:40:10.505
David Boder: Was that the place, where they made the Germans say how [unintelligible sentence ending].

00:40:10.505 --> 00:40:16.421
Wolf Nehrich: Yes, the Germans had to come with these, the dead one after the other, into the cemetery. I will turn to that later.

00:40:16.421 --> 00:40:18.120
David Boder: Yes. Well?

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:23.795
Wolf Nehrich: Well, at the time, I turned in the various, I lay down amongst the dead, where there were already a few.

00:40:23.795 --> 00:40:24.048
David Boder: Why?

00:40:24.048 --> 00:40:27.211
Wolf Nehrich: They should think I was dead. Then they won’t evacuate me.

00:40:27.211 --> 00:40:27.675
David Boder: I see.

00:40:27.675 --> 00:40:42.416
Wolf Nehrich: The dead stay [unintelligible sentence ending]. If I go on evacuation, then I know that I am already dead [Note: most of the time, Nehrich uses the German word “kaputt,” which he intends to mean “dead”; literally, “kaputt” means “broken,” “out of order,” or “destroyed.”]. And in order to make people come eh of their own choosing, so that they wouldn’t need to pull them, or eh, search for them, they said there would be two breads at the exit.

00:40:42.416 --> 00:40:42.970
David Boder: Mhm.

00:40:42.970 --> 00:41:25.684
Wolf Nehrich: That is so that they leave sooner. Some were like that, they made their pockets full, they wanted the two breads, went there fast, and the two breads they didn’t see. They afterwards only saw death in front of them. And I said: if I die, then I can die hungry, then I don’t have to eat and I didn’t go. I hid in various canals and amongst the dead, so that I always stayed. Then I again. An air raid came with seven planes, and, and the SS said, we have to wait until we get an order. And back then, there were 2000 SS men lay down on the big square between the casernes roundabout in such [unintelligible word]. And the planes lowered themselves with machine guns. Back then seven planes shot all SS men, the 2,000 that lay there, dead.

00:41:25.684 --> 00:41:25.985
David Boder: I see.

00:41:25.985 --> 00:41:26.919
Wolf Nehrich: With machine guns. They didn’t throw bombs.

00:41:26.919 --> 00:41:28.154
David Boder: They were the American...

00:41:28.154 --> 00:41:29.118
Wolf Nehrich: [interrupts] American planes.

00:41:29.118 --> 00:41:30.184
David Boder: They didn’t throw bombs.

00:41:30.184 --> 00:41:30.967
Wolf Nehrich: No, not.

00:41:30.967 --> 00:41:32.052
David Boder: Did they realize those were SS, SS men?

00:41:32.052 --> 00:41:36.582
Wolf Nehrich: Yes, you see the barracks after all, with the eh, swastika, and you also see the uniforms of the SS.

00:41:36.582 --> 00:41:36.793
David Boder: Yes.

00:41:36.793 --> 00:41:40.269
Wolf Nehrich: You see after all, that it is military. And even more so when they protect themselves.

00:41:40.269 --> 00:41:40.552
David Boder: Yes.

00:41:40.552 --> 00:41:45.371
Wolf Nehrich: They lie straight on the earth, after all, because they thought maybe that would protect them somehow. And it was still daylight.

00:41:45.371 --> 00:41:46.185
David Boder: Well?

00:41:46.185 --> 00:41:57.131
Wolf Nehrich: Afterwards they saw, that the SS men are not there, are dead. They soon produced interim guards, [unintelligible sentence part], camp, for, for the camp.

00:41:57.131 --> 00:41:57.504
David Boder: Well?

00:41:57.504 --> 00:41:59.101
Wolf Nehrich: For the evacuation, for the surveillance.

00:41:59.101 --> 00:41:59.896
David Boder: Well?

00:41:59.896 --> 00:42:10.468
Wolf Nehrich: So they brought others instead of the 2,000, you know, and they especially, we ran away back then, all camps, the planes after the battle flew above the camp a little, then they flew away again.

00:42:10.468 --> 00:42:14.866
David Boder: Yes. Well, who picked up these 2,000 SS men, removed them?

00:42:14.866 --> 00:42:25.149
Wolf Nehrich: Cars soon came, various people, big car. You know, they put the Germans on the car and drove them off. Where to you didn’t know. We just saw the cars, the trucks of the eh red cross.

00:42:25.149 --> 00:42:26.143
David Boder: Yes.

00:42:26.143 --> 00:42:29.095
Wolf Nehrich: Just like all other wounded and sick from the front.

00:42:29.095 --> 00:42:30.734
David Boder: Yes. Well?

00:42:30.734 --> 00:42:36.650
Wolf Nehrich: So, at that time we were still, that eh, that was around, maybe the 7th or 8th..

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:37.867
David Boder: 8th of what?

00:42:37.867 --> 00:42:38.391
Wolf Nehrich: On the 8th of eh...

00:42:38.391 --> 00:42:38.903
David Boder: April?

00:42:38.903 --> 00:42:39.415
Wolf Nehrich: April yes.

00:42:39.415 --> 00:42:41.042
David Boder: Yes.

00:42:41.042 --> 00:42:58.976
Wolf Nehrich: So, we still had a few days there amongst my block where there were youths. You know, and we should evacuate the next day, that was already the 10th. They said we had to evacuate the next day. Back then it was still, there were before that day, one week 70,000, 71,000 prisoners.

00:42:58.976 --> 00:42:59.380
David Boder: Yes.

00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:05.266
Wolf Nehrich: Or 72, depending on, 51,000 were shot and 21,000 were liberated.

00:43:05.266 --> 00:43:07.386
David Boder: What? A quarter how many were...

00:43:07.386 --> 00:43:08.591
Wolf Nehrich: [interrupts] There were 72,000.

00:43:08.591 --> 00:43:10.549
David Boder: Yes. How many were shot?

00:43:10.549 --> 00:43:11.543
Wolf Nehrich: 51

00:43:11.543 --> 00:43:12.868
David Boder: Who shot them? And how?

00:43:12.868 --> 00:43:17.658
Wolf Nehrich: SS took them into a forest and shot into the crowd, and eh, simply shot.

00:43:17.658 --> 00:43:19.538
David Boder: And then, where did the bodies stay?

00:43:19.538 --> 00:43:20.755
Wolf Nehrich: They stayed in the forest.

00:43:20.755 --> 00:43:21.671
David Boder: The dead bodies stayed...

00:43:21.671 --> 00:43:21.894
Wolf Nehrich: [interruptst] Yes.

00:43:21.894 --> 00:43:22.328
David Boder: . . . in the forest?

00:43:22.328 --> 00:43:29.720
Wolf Nehrich: In the forest. In the forest, in the fields. It’s not like that, when you shoot on top of the other. Then it doesn’t take up so much space.

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.118
David Boder: Well, did you see that?

00:43:31.118 --> 00:43:35.106
Wolf Nehrich: We afterwards saw the dead, and some fled from the dead.

00:43:35.106 --> 00:43:35.720
David Boder: I see.

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:41.082
Wolf Nehrich: From the ones, who were to be shot, eh, as they wanted to shoot, some ran away.

00:43:41.082 --> 00:43:41.486
David Boder: Yes.

00:43:41.486 --> 00:43:44.872
Wolf Nehrich: After the liberation we met them in the towns, and they told us everything.

00:43:44.872 --> 00:43:46.450
David Boder: I see. Well?

00:43:46.450 --> 00:44:33.435
Wolf Nehrich: And, eh, well, they should eh evacuate on the next day, and then there came at maybe eleven or twelve, because right on the alarm, that means hand alarm. It was, it was called, it was a siren for five minutes, it means the front comes nearer. The American tanks were slowly, slowly coming nearer. And so we thought, that we, now everything is going to be ok, we will maybe live. And some didn’t believe it. You can blow up the camp at the last moment after all. There were wires laid from the outside eh, from another from an, eh, external camp into the camp. It was in the foundation. You could simply press a button and the camp would blow up. We didn’t know if we would manage to get out, or not. You couldn’t cut the wire, because the wire was outside the camp.

00:44:33.435 --> 00:44:33.869
David Boder: Mhm.

00:44:33.869 --> 00:44:59.526
Wolf Nehrich: You couldn’t get near it. And the barb wire was eh electrically charged. We were eh, so, after we saw that the tanks were arriving [unintelligible word], you already saw from far away the tanks driving. So we looked out through the windows. At the top there were small openings in the windows, there you looked outside. And we saw that, we saw the star on, a white star on a tank, you know. We didn’t yet believe it ourselves, that it was the Americans, but still you saw the white star.

00:44:59.526 --> 00:45:00.472
David Boder: And where were the SS?

00:45:00.472 --> 00:45:19.129
Wolf Nehrich: The SS at the time had already pulled out of the camp. Some, some stayed. And the Americans were on a country road. They arrive, all, all SS are not gone yet. Some stayed, put on some different clothes, civilian clothing and wanted to get to the other side. They saw the tanks had arrived, the made a trench and hid in the trench.

00:45:19.129 --> 00:45:19.683
David Boder: Mhm.

00:45:19.683 --> 00:45:42.183
Wolf Nehrich: They couldn’t cross the country road. Then soon a tank was round, across the camp. They knew that there, uh, that this was a concentration camp. Because one day earlier a plane had come through. That was on the 10th. The day, it was nice sunshine. And they let down a few flyers that tomorrow, that they would try to get through tomorrow. And they threw an empty gasoline barrel out of the plane, with one bread, one white American bread.

00:45:42.183 --> 00:45:42.725
David Boder: Mhm.

00:45:42.725 --> 00:45:51.159
Wolf Nehrich: We were so happy. It is clear to everybody, everybody liked it. Many threw themselves on the bread, so everybody got just a small piece. [Unintelligible word] tore it entirely apart.

00:45:51.159 --> 00:45:51.822
David Boder: Mhm.

00:45:51.822 --> 00:46:02.545
Wolf Nehrich: The flyers came down only in our camp, and some flyers came down only a few, two maybe three, came down across the fence. Then SS men found the flyers, that...

00:46:02.545 --> 00:46:04.123
David Boder: [interrupts] And how where the flyers printed?

00:46:04.123 --> 00:46:09.063
Wolf Nehrich: The flyers were printed they would come tomorrow. It was block capitals, or printed?

00:46:09.063 --> 00:46:09.455
David Boder: Yes.

00:46:09.455 --> 00:46:10.160
Wolf Nehrich: Just like that.

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:11.708
David Boder: Mimeographed.

00:46:11.708 --> 00:46:12.130
Wolf Nehrich: Yes.

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:12.925
David Boder: Well?

00:46:12.925 --> 00:46:20.335
Wolf Nehrich: And, eh, afterwards a tank came round across the camp, it had circled the entire camp. And soon it drove through the gate.

00:46:20.335 --> 00:46:20.678
David Boder: Well?

00:46:20.678 --> 00:46:32.124
Wolf Nehrich: A big giant tank. And he circled the entire camp on the inside. White flags were hung out, and we took various things onto the roofs, we waved to the planes. Soon planes came, that we waved to.

00:46:32.124 --> 00:46:33.058
David Boder: Well?

00:46:33.058 --> 00:46:41.925
Wolf Nehrich: And eh, we already saw, it was, now we are liberated. They had kept camp ammunition and guns and machine guns various.

00:46:41.925 --> 00:46:42.859
David Boder: Who had kept these?

00:46:42.859 --> 00:46:46.474
Wolf Nehrich: The political prisoners had prepared it, in case the moment comes.

00:46:46.474 --> 00:46:46.757
David Boder: When?

00:46:46.757 --> 00:47:17.885
Wolf Nehrich: And they worked outside the camp in a [unintelligible word], there was an ammunitions factory, eh, they produced ammunition. There they sometimes, they could smuggle such bits and pieces into the camp. And from there they put them together, afterwards they had guns and ammunition. And eh, the eh, powder, you know, for a canon to shoot. We eh, we saw, you know, that the tanks were already there, and more tanks arrive and trucks and various. Back then all the tank drivers came, the Americans, the 3rd, the 3rd army it was.

00:47:17.885 --> 00:47:19.373
David Boder: And that was the [unintelligible word]army?

00:47:19.373 --> 00:47:20.771
Wolf Nehrich: No, the tanks, eh.

00:47:20.771 --> 00:47:21.476
David Boder: Yes.

00:47:21.476 --> 00:47:30.223
Wolf Nehrich: It was a huge number, they looked at them, you wondered, that they are so tall, and so on. And eh, amongst most were also Negroes.

00:47:30.223 --> 00:47:30.958
David Boder: Negroes were there?

00:47:30.958 --> 00:47:51.314
Wolf Nehrich: Yes. Amongst the first drivers. And they came into the camp there and gave us chocolate and everything to eat, and we soon had everything we wanted. But the political, the prisoners, the older ones, that had more strength, took pincers that were isolated with rubber and they kicked open the barbed wire, ripped it open and soon cut through the wires.

00:47:51.314 --> 00:47:51.633
David Boder: Mhm.

00:47:51.633 --> 00:48:14.988
Wolf Nehrich: And, so nothing can happen. They let out with guns, they brought the SS men, who were still behind the camp, between the country road and camp, into the camp. They hung them up afterwards and shot them, into the Bunker and they beat them, eh. They took a little bit of revenge. You can’t say the entire revenge, because they did more to us, they took our parents away and everything. It was only a small revenge, you have to say.

00:48:14.988 --> 00:48:16.176
David Boder: Well?

00:48:16.176 --> 00:48:17.893
Wolf Nehrich: Afterwards, eh, by chance...

00:48:17.893 --> 00:48:20.044
David Boder: [interrupts] And that’s why they hanged the SS?

00:48:20.044 --> 00:48:21.110
Wolf Nehrich: Yes of course.

00:48:21.110 --> 00:48:21.984
David Boder: Who did it?

00:48:21.984 --> 00:48:22.870
Wolf Nehrich: The prisoners.

00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:23.153
David Boder: Yes.

00:48:23.153 --> 00:48:23.997
Wolf Nehrich: So we did it.

00:48:23.997 --> 00:48:26.087
David Boder: Did the political prisoners let it happen?

00:48:26.087 --> 00:48:30.033
Wolf Nehrich: Yes, they, but we were all only political prisoners, we had to.

00:48:30.033 --> 00:48:31.569
David Boder: Yes. Well?

00:48:31.569 --> 00:48:42.804
Wolf Nehrich: And eh, back then, on the same day we were liberated on the 11th of April, somebody comes in, into our block, it was block 66, a youth block. And we didn’t know, surely an American...

00:48:42.804 --> 00:48:43.527
David Boder: [interrupts] A Youth block?

00:48:43.527 --> 00:48:44.642
Wolf Nehrich: A Youth Block, yes.

00:48:44.642 --> 00:48:44.955
David Boder: Yes.

00:48:44.955 --> 00:48:54.443
Wolf Nehrich: An American with a helmet, of the tanks, well eh, yes. He told us, he was a Jew, he was a rabbi, his name was Rabbi Schächter from New York, from Brooklyn.

00:48:54.443 --> 00:48:55.678
David Boder: Rabbi Schächter from Brooklyn?

00:48:55.678 --> 00:49:24.024
Wolf Nehrich: Rabbi Schächter from Brooklyn, yes. And at that time we were so happy. He said a few words to us, so it was a little relieve of the heart, that we, that it had been a Jewish American who put us out of our misery, here from this, with an army. And he told us, you know, that we, somebody, eh he would look after us and so on. So afterwards we were taken over into another, eh already not in the camp anymore. All youths were...

00:49:24.024 --> 00:49:24.518
David Boder: Yes.

00:49:24.518 --> 00:49:32.542
Wolf Nehrich: . . . moved to a ca-, SS caserne. Where the SS had been earlier, we lived afterwards. Because, eh the barracks were filthy, were many different.

00:49:32.542 --> 00:49:34.410
David Boder: You moved into the SS casernes?

00:49:34.410 --> 00:49:35.868
Wolf Nehrich: Yes. Into the SS casernes.

00:49:35.868 --> 00:49:36.151
David Boder: Yes.

00:49:36.151 --> 00:49:58.567
Wolf Nehrich: And so we already lived a little better, a bit more normal, because were all roughened back then. And we knew to make very much of happiness of the liberation. You jumped, you became crazy from happiness. And eh, at first we got a great deal from the Americans, you know, we the Germans from the town, from the Germans, they had to deliver various meats and eh butter various things. And everybody, they all...

00:49:58.567 --> 00:49:59.230
David Boder: [interrupts] Was all that there?

00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:10.597
Wolf Nehrich: Of course, there was economy, you know, entire fields and cows everything. So they had to deliver everything to Buchenwald. And only a part contingent they could afford. We came into the caserns afterwards...

00:50:10.597 --> 00:50:12.013
David Boder: [interrupts] A part of what?

00:50:12.013 --> 00:50:38.639
Wolf Nehrich: Of the contingent, you know, what they had to deliver, they were afraid [unintelligible word] came into the casernes afterwards. The Rabbi Schächter did not leave us alone anymore, he incessantly got us everything, came every day with the taxi and spoke to us various things and brought various things, whatever you needed, clothes and all the different things. And provided a lot of things. Afterwards they took [unintelligible word]. Three more months we stayed in Buchenwald after the liberation.

00:50:38.639 --> 00:50:39.796
David Boder: [interrupts Nehrich] Three more months in Buchenwald?

00:50:39.796 --> 00:50:40.079
Wolf Nehrich: Yes.

00:50:40.079 --> 00:50:40.290
David Boder: Yes, but you already lived freely?

00:50:40.290 --> 00:50:42.290
Wolf Nehrich: [speaks unintelligibly, simultaneously with Boder]

00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:48.344
Wolf Nehrich: Yes, we were, were entirely free, you couldn’t say free any more, already too free you were.

00:50:48.344 --> 00:50:48.796
David Boder: Yes.

00:50:48.796 --> 00:51:04.160
Wolf Nehrich: You could take revenge on the Germans. You could catch SS men, you drove around a little in the American jeeps into the villages, and we, where we only suspected someone, and we soon took him with us and sat him into the bunker. We hanged quite a few, we caught the “Rapportführer” of Buchenwald, we hanged him.

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:04.883
David Boder: Who did you catch?

00:51:04.883 --> 00:51:06.371
Wolf Nehrich: The “Rapportführer” of Buchenwald.

00:51:06.371 --> 00:51:07.377
David Boder: Who was he?

00:51:07.377 --> 00:51:10.208

00:51:19.143 --> 00:51:21.280
David Boder: Did the Americans let this happen?

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:22.228
Wolf Nehrich: Of course.

00:51:22.228 --> 00:51:23.023
David Boder: I see.

00:51:23.023 --> 00:51:28.806
Wolf Nehrich: And the Americans themselves couldn’t do these things, because during the shootings they had, they were too soft, they always said.

00:51:28.806 --> 00:51:29.047
David Boder: Yes.

00:51:29.047 --> 00:51:38.144
Wolf Nehrich: [Unintelligible sentence beginning] to do that. They always said, you do it, we don’t want to see. But amongst these there were many Jews, who hated more intensely. So that...

00:51:38.144 --> 00:51:38.698
David Boder: [interrupts] Amongst whom?

00:51:38.698 --> 00:51:49.313
Wolf Nehrich: Amongst the Americans there were some Jews. So they hated more intensely. So they had, because they knew, that the Germans mostly only killed the Jews. So they took revenge. Most of them.

00:51:49.313 --> 00:51:50.048
David Boder: Mhm.

00:51:50.048 --> 00:52:25.343

And then came a time, when we, we had to, we organized a transport together with Rabbi Schächter. A transport of Jews that should go to Switzerland. And we all left, 53 youths, we came to Switzerland. Switzerland for recreation. I came with them. And the Rabbi Schächter was the transport ehm leader of this train. We drove for about four days.

Wolf Nehrich: He had to go to his army after all. So eh, he went away and he organized other transports again, that went to Palestine and so on. So some also went to France, stayed there, because we drove through France. Afterwards we were, we should stay for three months, but we didn’t have return tickets yet, back home nobody eh nobody wanted to go.

00:54:31.295 --> 00:54:34.861

00:54:41.904 --> 00:54:45.820
Wolf Nehrich: Then they were still in Będzin, where I was taken away. Afterwards they were moved.

00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:47.398

Wolf Nehrich: No, you had, above all it was on your mind, simply, you were hungry, and you came from work very tired. [Unintelligible sentence]

00:57:55.554 --> 00:57:59.892
David Boder: [speaks unintelligibly over Nehrich] A young man. Did you sometimes think about a girl or the likes?

00:57:59.892 --> 00:58:01.500
Wolf Nehrich: That was never on my mind. Never.

00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:02.344
David Boder: Why not?

00:58:02.344 --> 00:58:19.675
Wolf Nehrich: How could these things be on your mind, when you, when you were hungry, you know. And you were week, you had work to do, because some looked to get through the day, because we survived the day. And you lie on the pallets, then you just said: or one day nearer to the liberation, or one day nearer to death. You didn’t know which.

00:58:19.675 --> 00:58:22.590
David Boder: And what did you think, what would it last. What, what...

00:58:22.590 --> 00:58:51.045
Wolf Nehrich: Who had courage conjured different fantasies, he survived. And who said, eh, because it was true, oh who can bear up here, you get nothing to eat, the hard work, he died soon simply because he thought this. But I always said, eh, I was born a Jew, I will be a Jew. And eh, we Jews are a suffering, you always must suffer, and I just hope, that eh, they will get us through. Indeed they brought us through.

00:58:51.045 --> 00:58:54.822
David Boder: Tell me, eh, did you have any poems in the camp?

00:58:54.822 --> 00:58:59.882
Wolf Nehrich: Yes, we even had a Buchenwald song, we had. Maybe you have already heard it?

00:58:59.882 --> 00:59:02.051
David Boder: How was it, can you sing it eh, slowly?

00:59:02.051 --> 00:59:05.394
Wolf Nehrich: Yes. I even wrote it down here. I know it by heart, too, but I.

00:59:05.394 --> 00:59:16.060
David Boder: Yes, but [unintelligible word]. Read a little with the melody, yes?

00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:16.753
Wolf Nehrich: Sorry?

00:59:16.753 --> 00:59:19.675
David Boder: Eh, maybe sing it a little, so you can hear the words clearly, yes.

00:59:19.675 --> 00:59:21.916
Wolf Nehrich: Yes. Well, this is a song eh.

00:59:21.916 --> 00:59:23.645
David Boder: [unintelligible sentence]

00:59:23.645 --> 00:59:36.308
Wolf Nehrich: This is a song the camp commander of Buchenwald requested, that you should make a song and for it you would be given 100 cigarettes and eh, and eh, ten mark. But the 100 cigarettes you never saw of course.

00:59:36.308 --> 00:59:36.772
David Boder: I see.

00:59:36.772 --> 00:59:38.742
Wolf Nehrich: And neither the ten mark, you only had the song.

00:59:38.742 --> 00:59:42.850
David Boder: But then, was the song eh, the way, the Germans would like it?

00:59:42.850 --> 00:59:48.362
Wolf Nehrich: Yes, the song was made, you know, a little like that, eh, because we thought, maybe they will not like it, but they let us sing it.

00:59:48.362 --> 00:59:48.754
David Boder: I see.

00:59:48.754 --> 00:59:53.091
Wolf Nehrich: Yes, sometimes we even have to sing it while bringing in the dead of the camp from the building site.

00:59:53.091 --> 00:59:53.332
David Boder: I see.

00:59:53.332 --> 00:59:54.628
Wolf Nehrich: into camp. You had to sing it, too.

00:59:54.628 --> 00:59:55.152
David Boder: Sing now.

00:59:55.152 --> 00:59:58.345
Wolf Nehrich: But the song goes like this, Buchenwald song: “When the day awakes...”

00:59:58.345 --> 00:59:59.803
David Boder: [interrupts] Can you, sing it with the melody.

00:59:59.803 --> 01:00:00.538
Wolf Nehrich: I have a bad voice today.

01:00:00.538 --> 01:00:03.442
David Boder: [interrupts] No, no, no, not at all. Sing very softly, but clear words.

01:00:03.442 --> 01:00:18.936
Wolf Nehrich: [sings] “When the day awakes before the sun is laughing. The columns march to their daily toils. Into the breaking day. And the forest is black and the heaven red, and the wind sings softly and I...”

01:00:18.936 --> 01:00:20.755
David Boder: Read, read it.

01:00:20.755 --> 01:00:42.532
Wolf Nehrich: [reads] “and I carry, and we carry in the backpack a little piece of bread, and in the heart, in the heart the worries. Oh, Buchenwald, I cannot forget you, because you are my destiny. Only those, who leave you can imagine how wonderful freedom is. But Buchenwald, we won’t moan and lament, and whatever our future may be. We want to say yes to life nevertheless, because one time the day will come and we’ll be free.”

01:00:42.532 --> 01:00:43.918
David Boder: And you were allowed to sing this?

01:00:43.918 --> 01:00:44.412
Wolf Nehrich: Yes.

01:00:44.412 --> 01:00:45.026
David Boder: Go on.

01:00:45.026 --> 01:00:46.382
Wolf Nehrich: I’d rather not sing it, because I don’t have...

01:00:46.382 --> 01:00:46.786
David Boder: [interrupts] Yes!

01:00:46.786 --> 01:00:47.732
Wolf Nehrich: . . . a good voice.

01:00:47.732 --> 01:00:48.166
David Boder: Yes.

01:00:48.166 --> 01:01:19.171
Wolf Nehrich: [reads] “And the night is short and the day so long, but a song sounds out, that home sung. We won’t let them rob our courage. Keep marching, comrade, and don’t lose the courage, because we carry the will to live in the blood, and in the heart, in the heart the faith. Oh, Buchenwald, I cannot forget you, because you are my destiny. Only those, who leave you can imagine how wonderful freedom is. But Buchenwald, we won’t moan and lament, and whatever our future may be. We want to say yes to life nevertheless, because one time the day will come and we’ll be free.”

01:01:19.171 --> 01:01:20.538
David Boder: Yes.

01:01:20.538 --> 01:01:52.503
Wolf Nehrich: [reads] “And the blood is hot and the girl so far, and the wind sings softly, and I like her so much. Oh, if faithful, if faithful she would stay to me. And the stones are hard but, hard but strong, and the walk, and we carry pickaxes and spades with us. And in the heart, in the heart, the love. Oh, Buchenwald, I cannot forget you, because you are my destiny. Only those, who leave you can imagine how wonderful freedom is. But Buchenwald, we won’t moan and lament, and whatever our future may be. We want to say yes to life nevertheless, because one time the day will come and we’ll be free, free, free.”

01:01:52.503 --> 01:01:54.413
David Boder: Yes. And this they allowed to be sung?

01:01:54.413 --> 01:01:55.961
Wolf Nehrich: Yes. We even had to sing it.

01:01:55.961 --> 01:01:56.485
David Boder: You had to.

01:01:56.485 --> 01:01:59.196
Wolf Nehrich: When sometimes you didn’t have the head for it, you had to sing it.

01:01:59.196 --> 01:02:01.497
David Boder: Yes, Now tell me...

01:02:01.497 --> 01:02:02.190
Wolf Nehrich: This is the Buchenwald emblem.

01:02:02.190 --> 01:02:06.841
David Boder: Yes. This is supposed to be the Buchenwald sign? Triangle, was it Jewish or political?

01:02:06.841 --> 01:02:07.696
Wolf Nehrich: Political.

01:02:07.696 --> 01:02:10.136
David Boder: I see. And the Jews had the political [unintelligible word].

01:02:10.136 --> 01:02:12.847
Wolf Nehrich: Yes. Political and additionally on top a yellow. That was [unintelligible word].

01:02:12.847 --> 01:02:26.943
David Boder: Ah, above were yellow signs. Now tell me this: Eh, how, Eh,eh: What are you planning to do now?

01:02:26.943 --> 01:02:38.426
Wolf Nehrich: Now, eh, I’m in the vocational school of the ORT, I’m learning carpentry. The vocational school is very good. You can learn the profession very well, maybe not so, eh, maybe nowhere as good as in this school. And afterwards, when I...

01:02:38.426 --> 01:02:39.204
David Boder: [interrupts] Carpentry, then.

01:02:39.204 --> 01:02:47.005
Wolf Nehrich: Yes, carpentry. Once I know the subject better, I don’t know whether I will finish it completely, I hope yes, then I’ll go to Palestine.

01:02:47.005 --> 01:02:54.186
David Boder: Yes. Now tell me this: Eh, and what is this place in which you now live?

01:02:54.186 --> 01:03:05.433
Wolf Nehrich: It is a youth center, you know, it is a religious center. The religious, those who want, want to be religious. Now they are here in this center, you know, just as in all the other centers

01:03:05.433 --> 01:03:12.975
David Boder: And why did you decide to be relig-, religious? [Unintelligible sentence part] you were about twelve years old. Were your parents religious?

01:03:12.975 --> 01:03:16.379
Wolf Nehrich: My parents were religious. And I have accepted that you have to be religious.

01:03:16.379 --> 01:03:17.807
David Boder: When have you accepted this?

01:03:17.807 --> 01:03:27.940
Wolf Nehrich: I saw it the whole, throughout the whole time, you know, I always, although I was in grave danger, the whole time I always believed in God, and I made it through, still believing in God.

01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:30.904
David Boder: Did they allow the Jews to pray in the camp?

01:03:30.904 --> 01:03:36.006
Wolf Nehrich: No, they didn’t. You, sometimes you prayed, hid-, hidden away.

01:03:36.006 --> 01:03:36.247
David Boder: Yes.

01:03:36.247 --> 01:03:42.151
Wolf Nehrich: But it was forbidden. Strictly forbidden. If they found, caught someone, he got beaten with a stick afterwards.

01:03:42.151 --> 01:03:44.422
David Boder: I see. So [unintelligible word] you didn’t have?

01:03:44.422 --> 01:03:45.356
Wolf Nehrich: No, not that.

01:03:45.356 --> 01:03:48.169
David Boder: Did you have a prayer book?

01:03:48.169 --> 01:03:53.169
Wolf Nehrich: Maybe somebody could have it sown, sown in, and could then have hidden it somewhere in the camp.

01:03:53.169 --> 01:03:55.067
David Boder: I see. So, what, how did you pray?

01:03:55.067 --> 01:03:56.645
Wolf Nehrich: By heart. However you could.

01:03:56.645 --> 01:04:03.362
David Boder: I see. And, eh, did many know the Jewish prayers by heart? Did you know some?

01:04:03.362 --> 01:04:12.940
Wolf Nehrich: [speaks over Boder] Those who knew, knew. Not everybody, not always did you pray. Sometimes, you recited the [unintelligible word] by heart, or sometimes the [unintelligible word, both probably Jewish prayers] and that was already something.

01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:24.202
David Boder: I see. And why did you say, that eh things, eh, ok, Well, eh, so now you’re planning to go to Palestine?

01:04:24.202 --> 01:04:24.575
Wolf Nehrich: Yes.

01:04:24.575 --> 01:04:26.021
David Boder: And your brother wants to go to Palestine.

01:04:26.021 --> 01:04:27.106
Wolf Nehrich: Yes. Together with the brother.

01:04:27.106 --> 01:04:29.829
David Boder: How do you think, how will you get there?

01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:36.136
Wolf Nehrich: Why. What, how, whatever possibility there is, that is how we’ll go there.

01:04:36.136 --> 01:04:48.136
David Boder: Well, this was very good Mr., eh, Nehrich. I am really glad I came over. And I think everything will be ok. And if I see the Rabbi Schächter I will send him greetings.

01:04:48.136 --> 01:04:52.203
Wolf Nehrich: Yes. Great pleasure.

01:04:52.203 --> 01:05:13.822
David Boder: [In English] This concludes the interview with Wolf Nehrich, eh, in Geneva, at, eh, August the 26th 1946. We curtail, that we finish that at, eh, the spool of 25 minutes. He has spoken one full spool and 25 minutes on the other. And that is about all. Eh, Illinois Institute of Technology recording.
