Vladus Lukosevicius: We [escaped?] so 3 days and 3 night across Prussia and while we were going to the Polish territory we didn’t have anything to eat. [To?] the military clothing it was impossible to show ourselves to the Germans [anywhere?]

00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:39.867
David Boder: So.

00:09:39.867 --> 00:09:43.373
Vladus Lukosevicius: And on the road to ask for cabbage soup, only downwind [at nights? ).

00:09:43.373 --> 00:09:46.475
David Boder: Didn’t you have any symbols on your clothing that you were prisoners?

00:09:46.475 --> 00:09:49.036
Vladus Lukosevicius: [Since?] our clothing was all Polish.

00:09:49.036 --> 00:09:49.440
David Boder: Aha.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.326

David Boder: Yes.

00:09:50.459 --> 00:09:56.465
Vladus Lukosevicius: So, we didn’t should ourselves at day. We walked only at night and not along the roads, but through the fields and right through the woods.

00:09:56.465 --> 00:09:57.459
David Boder: So. Five men.

00:09:57.459 --> 00:09:58.573

David Boder: So.

00:10:04.502 --> 00:10:22.104
Vladus Lukosevicius: What [we had taken?] with ourselves potatoes there, a little [cheese?], as we had been thinking to run away, so again at this estimate we took for ourselves there a little millet bread, and we were not able to ask anyone along the way for 3 days anything [we did not get anywhere, all day?] We didn’t know how to say that [in German?] and the other thing was, that the clothing was military.

00:10:22.104 --> 00:10:22.496
David Boder: So.

00:10:22.496 --> 00:10:23.321
Vladus Lukosevicius: So, we walked to [blocked by Boder]

00:10:23.321 --> 00:10:25.400

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.069
Vladus Lukosevicius: It was possible there [food and some water?] [blocked by Boder]

00:10:27.069 --> 00:10:30.394
David Boder: Well, just something, you did eat something, right?

00:10:30.394 --> 00:10:33.015
Vladus Lukosevicius: Well, one day we ate what we had with us.

00:10:33.015 --> 00:10:33.750
David Boder: So.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.931
Vladus Lukosevicius: We had taken [that in the pockets?], there wasn’t even anything to take.

00:10:35.931 --> 00:10:36.274
David Boder: So.

00:10:36.274 --> 00:10:38.865
Vladus Lukosevicius: A after 2 days we didn’t eat anything.

00:10:38.865 --> 00:10:38.998
David Boder: Aha.

00:10:38.998 --> 00:10:43.317
Vladus Lukosevicius: And so I [and just what?] [were?] not glad that we had escpated. [We would have wanted that?] [unknown number of words garbled] too.

00:10:43.317 --> 00:10:43.739
David Boder: So.

00:10:43.739 --> 00:10:47.486

00:10:55.216 --> 00:10:56.463
Vladus Lukosevicius: The Germans were in the villages, [blocked by Boder].

00:10:56.463 --> 00:10:58.343
David Boder: So. But, [in?] Poland did the Poles help?

00:10:58.343 --> 00:11:14.379
Vladus Lukosevicius: The Poles [1-2 garbled] helped very well. At night along a [piece?] at night, yes, [you ask aren’t there any Germans in this village?] and they would indicate that there are no Germans in [this village?], then we would enter a room at night and they would feed us, and on the road then it was already good.

00:11:14.379 --> 00:11:17.615
David Boder: So. Well.. And where did you [end up?]?

00:11:17.615 --> 00:11:28.079
Vladus Lukosevicius: Well, well like this. We got [stammers] to the Soviet border, where there already it was, ah, the Soviet-German border. [Poland?] had been divided.

00:11:28.079 --> 00:11:29.266
David Boder: So.

00:11:40.562 --> 00:11:41.737
David Boder: So.

00:11:41.737 --> 00:11:43.044
Vladus Lukosevicius: Well, [interrupted by Boder].

00:11:43.044 --> 00:11:45.032
David Boder: [Wait?] a tributary [of the Neva)?

00:11:45.032 --> 00:11:46.418
Vladus Lukosevicius: Not the Neva, the Visla.

00:11:46.418 --> 00:11:47.514
David Boder: A tributary of the Visla to the Neva.

00:11:47.514 --> 00:11:49.051
Vladus Lukosevicius: [Blocked by Boder] the Narva.

00:11:49.051 --> 00:11:49.876
David Boder: So.

00:11:49.876 --> 00:11:56.804
Vladus Lukosevicius: Well, then we in this, in this, there were guards there on [the bridges?].

00:11:56.804 --> 00:11:57.557
David Boder: Russian!

00:11:57.557 --> 00:11:59.063
Vladus Lukosevicius: No, no, still German.

00:11:59.063 --> 00:11:59.334
David Boder: So.

00:11:59.334 --> 00:12:06.503
Vladus Lukosevicius: So, we were afraid to go across the river, we had to swim across the Narva river [he continues to call it the Narva. It is the Narev.] This Narva river [is?] rather wide.

00:12:06.503 --> 00:12:08.232
David Boder: So.

00:12:08.232 --> 00:12:12.099
Vladus Lukosevicius: Well, in [stops] ah, in a village near the Narva it was full of Germans.

00:12:12.099 --> 00:12:12.340
David Boder: So.

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:23.124
Vladus Lukosevicius: So, we [individually?] decided there in [1-2 garbled], everyone looked [1-2 garbled] [the German us?] at nights as already [it had been tried?] so in this village lived fisherman and there were boats there.

00:12:23.124 --> 00:12:23.618
David Boder: So.

00:12:23.618 --> 00:12:55.991
Vladus Lukosevicius: Boats. So, at night we [as attempted?] we went into the village, stole a boat [so that we started?]) [3-4 garbled] the river. But, the small brook that passed the village toward the Narva was already ice covered, but the larger rive was not frozen. Then we [carried this?] boat and [three sat down?] [stammers] in the boat to cross this river and ga- gathered [full of ice?]. Then again [of the holes?] were pulled out into this water [1-2 garbled] and a trio sat down and crossed the river to the other side.

00:12:55.991 --> 00:12:56.473
David Boder: And two were left?

00:12:56.473 --> 00:13:00.841
Vladus Lukosevicius: Two were left. One then returned and again took them...

00:13:00.841 --> 00:13:01.636
David Boder: Well, so.

00:13:01.636 --> 00:13:03.022
Vladus Lukosevicius: . . . and brought them across the river.

00:13:03.022 --> 00:13:04.239
David Boder: And the Germans didn’t notice anyone.

00:13:04.239 --> 00:13:05.125
Vladus Lukosevicius: The Germans didn’t notice.

00:13:05.125 --> 00:13:06.161
David Boder: And the Russians didn’t notice?

00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:10.318
Vladus Lukosevicius: The Russians were further, it was still further to the Russian border, well...

00:13:10.318 --> 00:13:11.445
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:11.445 --> 00:13:13.957
Vladus Lukosevicius: . . . maybe about another 20 kilomters.

00:13:13.957 --> 00:13:14.740
David Boder: So.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:29.529
Vladus Lukosevicius: To this river. Well then, as we had walked with luck, we crossed this river and reached the very Soviet border unnoticed, completely unnoticed and we didn’t know in this direction [1-2 garbled] who wouldn’t detain us at the border.

00:13:29.529 --> 00:13:29.921
David Boder: So.

00:13:29.921 --> 00:13:34.120
Vladus Lukosevicius: As much as they detained us, it was already 15 kilometers beyond the border [2-3 garbled] city...

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:34.403
David Boder: So.

00:13:34.403 --> 00:13:36.090
Vladus Lukosevicius: . . . a Soviet patrol there.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.668
David Boder: So. Well..

00:13:37.668 --> 00:14:06.440
Vladus Lukosevicius: Well, it had been going very well for us and we didn’t think that there was [those who had come, reached?] a window. We thought that the farmer, to sleep through the day and through the night. [We desired?] that we sleep at day. Well. [we refused?] that the Russian soldiers there [nearly 40 of them slept?]. [Questionable passages as well as possibly bad grammar make this sentence extremely difficult to translate. The sentence probably should read: “Well, it turned out that there were nearly 40 Russian soldiers sleeping there.”] Well, it was not us [1 garbled], they gave us [salami?] [2-3 garbled], they gave us some bread, everything, well (stammers/2-3 garbled] we were doing, [we didn’t have?] any such weapons and we slept with them as with good friends.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.675
David Boder: So.

00:14:07.675 --> 00:14:28.446
Vladus Lukosevicius: Well then, the second day, in the morning, [they took?] us already there to their, to their commandant’s office. The questioned how that what [garbled], we all were able to speed Russian well. Well, so, the let us go home to our own homeland, where, where I lived.

00:14:28.446 --> 00:14:29.663
David Boder: And [in unbelief?]?

00:14:29.663 --> 00:14:30.187
Vladus Lukosevicius: Yes.

00:14:30.187 --> 00:14:30.820
David Boder: So.

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:35.561
Vladus Lukosevicius: The Vilnius area [where I?] lived there. Well, so we then started...

00:14:35.561 --> 00:14:36.447
David Boder: Louder.

00:14:36.447 --> 00:14:39.260
Vladus Lukosevicius: . . . then we already had arrived by train.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:40.194
David Boder: So.

00:14:40.194 --> 00:14:50.086
Vladus Lukosevicius: [1-2 weak/garbled] the station [to Lyntupy?] and went home on foot there already. Well, all the time nothing [was strking?].

00:14:50.086 --> 00:14:51.393
David Boder: A bit louder. [Boder must believe Lukosevicius is not speaking loudly enough, but he is almost too loud.]

00:14:51.393 --> 00:15:01.634
Vladus Lukosevicius: Yes. We lived the whole time under Soviet authority, but I worked as a business and how...it had begun [blocked by Boder].

00:15:01.634 --> 00:15:02.658

Vladus Lukosevicius: Well, [a farm worker?.)...

00:15:03.652 --> 00:15:03.923
David Boder: So.

00:15:03.923 --> 00:15:10.128
Vladus Lukosevicius: . . . as a farmer. Well, we lived all the time as in 1941 the war started.

00:15:10.128 --> 00:15:10.670
David Boder: So.

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:12.628
Vladus Lukosevicius: Then the Germans arrived.

00:15:12.628 --> 00:15:14.315
David Boder: And the soldier didn’t take you prisoner?

00:15:14.315 --> 00:15:15.020

David Boder: So.

00:15:39.171 --> 00:16:15.525
Vladus Lukosevicius: So, in 1942 and...as we...we already had [1-2 garbled] to [?kipits??] [the commissars?] and they were [farm workers?] [3-4 garbled], well so, in the town of Lyntupy?, in Lyntupy?, a very small town. (2-3 garbled] town. So, it was ordered there that the Germans were coming to collect the horses and carts in the town of Lyntupy?. Well so, early in the morning, it was 1942, the 20th of May...

David Boder: So.

00:16:16.399 --> 00:16:36.441
Vladus Lukosevicius: . . . The Svenchan kreislandwirtschaftsfuehrer Josef Beck and his deputy [Walter Gruel?] [or possibly Walter Gruen] were going by auto to Lyntupy? [1 garbled] [to take?] the horses [1 garbled], and 4 kilometers before the reached Lyntupy?, the city, the town, well, some kind of partisans killed these Germans.

00:16:46.935 --> 00:16:47.237
David Boder: So.

00:16:47.237 --> 00:16:54.147
Vladus Lukosevicius: And one captain a German and a driver and the translator, Rakauskaite.

00:16:54.147 --> 00:16:55.063

Vladus Lukosevicius: . . . The SS, the Sicherheit unit, arrived...[Lukosevicius pronounces German words with Russian endings.]

00:17:17.022 --> 00:17:17.426
David Boder: So.

00:17:17.426 --> 00:17:44.272

And all the men from 18 years old, if he were 16 years old [1 garbled] not small [age?] of the man, the gathered [everyone?]. Up to 60 years, up to 55 so, they did not take the women. Well, so, the people didn’t know anything. They thought that they would be helping find these partisans [that?] had done this.

00:17:44.272 --> 00:17:45.116
David Boder: So.

00:17:45.116 --> 00:17:53.712

00:17:53.712 --> 00:17:54.224
David Boder: Hm-mmm.

00:17:54.224 --> 00:18:26.691
Vladus Lukosevicius: . . . and [in my pocket?] and me [on a body where these?] people stood, one in a shirt, another without a peaked cap, [1 garbled], who stood and something the Germans around with rifles [at?] [2-3 garbled] rifle Germ(ans) were walking around. One German [appeared?] out of this [company?] and called me to approach him. I again immediately [and I didn’t want to?]. He moved up [frivolously?] and [said] “come here.” Well, I approached and he showed me where [1-2 garbled] to stand. I in German [blocked by Boder].

00:18:26.691 --> 00:18:28.330
David Boder: [Blocked/garbled] to stand?

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:31.505
Vladus Lukosevicius: Where the people were standing. Nearly 60 men were already standing...

00:18:31.505 --> 00:18:31.939
David Boder: Apart?

00:18:31.939 --> 00:18:36.078
Vladus Lukosevicius: Apart, and around them wal, walked Germans with rifles...

00:18:36.078 --> 00:18:36.361
David Boder: So.

00:18:36.361 --> 00:18:58.421
Vladus Lukosevicius: . . . at the ready. Well, then if I didn’t want [these?] Germans [captured me?] [5-6 garbled] said where to stand there. I stood, but from, I wanted to ask these people, what [2-3 garbled] “Who [drove?] you,” but (it/I) did not [2-3 garbled] that I didn’t say anything.

00:18:58.421 --> 00:18:59.626
David Boder: So.

00:18:59.626 --> 00:20:17.508
Vladus Lukosevicius: Well, then for some...another half hour they drove in more people, the drove in more men gather from other villages. [“Drove” is used in the sense of “driving cattle.”] There already perhaps were nearly 200, and so one [could?] not well according to them [to indicate myself to be regarded?] everything from fear. Well, and then [garbled] throught [1 garbled] village to Lyntupy. So, we thought there would be some kind of interrogation. [He would?] ask [someone?], something they drove and then turned to [Barannoe?] Field, near the woods there is a such a burial ground and there was [1 garbled] wires around ([gorodina??]. They drove us and left us and said to come ahead already in three, [threes, well?]. In threes ahead. [Three each so?] they supplied, and German SS soldiers were laying there with rifles and with machine guns and they began to shoot. From [the first?] [1-2 garbled] [to cry out?] [1 garbled] the 3rd and the 4th, and everyone began to cross themselves and to pray. There one of the second [1 garbled] a father with a son and a brother with a brother began to see just that [wasn’t already?] earlier [had passed?] the village. So, [the Germans carried?] every village one at a time. [1 garbled] [entered?] [one?] village [2-3 garbled] of a company [blocked by Boder].

00:20:17.508 --> 00:20:18.321
David Boder: And you?

00:20:18.321 --> 00:20:31.376
Vladus Lukosevicius: [2 garbled]. “Well, come here. Come on.” [Well that again will bring training again?]. That man doesn’t know [for what and how?] [Unknown number of garbled words] [they brought one already. They brought each village one at a time?].

00:20:31.376 --> 00:20:32.472
David Boder: And did the say why they [1-2 garbled]

00:20:32.472 --> 00:20:45.906
Vladus Lukosevicius: Nothing, nothing, they didn’t say anything. The, well, they began to shoot so [1-2 garbled] [three at a time they?] held on [everyone three each?]. [After?] [1-2 garbled] [such?] can already fif- [stops, corrects) nearly 50 men were killed.

00:20:45.906 --> 00:20:46.237
David Boder: So.

00:20:46.237 --> 00:21:01.883
Vladus Lukosevicius: So everyone, one was located of such [1-2 garbled] village [?Zhiromsk??] [such?]. So, that one grabbed [1 garbled], jumped at the German machine gunners, [and succeeded?] to take away a machine gun. So, at this time there was luck for some to escape. [How he fought?] with these [pauses/interrupted by Boder]

00:21:01.883 --> 00:21:03.932
David Boder: [1-2 garbled] there was one machine gun?

00:21:03.932 --> 00:21:11.293
Vladus Lukosevicius: There was a machine gun from one side, from the other there I was unable to count [3-4 garbled] [200?]. [2-3 garbled] not completely remembered, everything [wasn’t?]...

00:21:11.293 --> 00:21:11.474
David Boder: So.

00:21:11.474 --> 00:21:12.980
Vladus Lukosevicius: . . . remembered fully.

David Boder: So.

00:21:13.131 --> 00:21:15.794
Vladus Lukosevicius: [1-2 garbled] [crossed themselves?] and no one knew what to do.

00:21:15.794 --> 00:21:16.167
David Boder: So.

00:21:16.167 --> 00:21:23.667
Vladus Lukosevicius: Well, to stand all around with automatic weapons and bayonets on the rifles all around, and here [a soldier?] [1-2 garbled] they shoot.

00:21:23.667 --> 00:21:24.571
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:24.571 --> 00:21:40.483
Vladus Lukosevicius: Well, how he fought that one such [1-2 garbled] was a man, he fought with this machine gunner, so more Germans jumped in and [attacked him with bayonets?], and I, perhaps some half minutes passed and at this time maybe nearly 20 of us men succeeded in escaping.

00:21:40.483 --> 00:21:40.947
David Boder: Where [did you run?]?

00:21:40.947 --> 00:21:41.772
Vladus Lukosevicius: Into the woods.

00:21:41.772 --> 00:21:42.134
David Boder: So.

00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:46.351
Vladus Lukosevicius: [We ran?], I don’t remember anything [where and what, to [2-3 garbled] on, on these which [1-2 blocked by Boder]...

David Boder: [Blocked by Lukosevicius, above].

00:21:46.875 --> 00:22:05.339
Vladus Lukosevicius: . . . And [they held onto?] the killed and so straight into the woods and [1-2 garbled] [and so needed?], I don’t even remember anything, how, how, how it remained. And the firing there was long and there nearly 400 men were killed [on that very day?] and finished off. Well, then on the next day...

00:22:05.339 --> 00:22:07.038
David Boder: Were they all Lithuanians?

00:22:07.038 --> 00:22:09.640
Vladus Lukosevicius: There were [Slovaks, and also there were?] Byelorussians there. [The dubious word “Slovaks” is most definitely not “Poles.” According to Piotrowski there were 200 Poles killed that day on the streets and in their homes.]

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:10.875
David Boder: So. Were there any Jews?

That hone didn’t know anything, [he left a horse?] [1-2 garbled]. He approached here to [1 garbled) not to pass, “come with us.” And he went and he went, so well, a man, ah, was sitting in a room, [2-3 garbled] “come here.” Ano...Another [still didn’t know?] he saw that all the people [were walking by day?] and he went there as left [blocked by Boder]. [Lukosevicius may be speaking about the Germans rounding up people from their fields and homes. During this part of the interview he was very agitated and speaking very rapidly.]

00:22:34.291 --> 00:22:36.761
David Boder: Yes. [Who is with you?]? [Both speaking at once. All garbled.]

00:22:36.761 --> 00:22:45.538

00:22:55.605 --> 00:22:55.888
David Boder: So.

00:22:55.888 --> 00:22:59.472
Vladus Lukosevicius: . . . For the time being it has come from memory. Well, then [I thought?] I already was home.

00:22:59.472 --> 00:23:00.105
David Boder: You went home?

00:23:00.105 --> 00:23:00.677
Vladus Lukosevicius: I went home.

00:23:00.677 --> 00:23:02.244
David Boder: So. And you [2-3 garbled] wrote [1-2 garbled]?

David Boder: So.

00:23:08.196 --> 00:23:34.377
Vladus Lukosevicius: And they did [not?] look for anything and [1-2 garbled/too weak] anything. Well, they took such [they got rid of, it was necessary to settle?] everything. Well, then they finished off the people so who had remained alive, so well the other [half of the woods?] both alive and healthy, and those not alive [she was?], well, from [2-3 garbled]. [So he/This way?], so, I/he lay there as the Germans left. They finished off those who were still alive. They shot them in the head with explosive bullets.

David Boder: So.

00:23:34.709 --> 00:23:44.902
Vladus Lukosevicius: Well, so...one another there [further?] 300 [1-2 garbled) perhaps 3 people [to leave and along the bodies?] [2-3 garbled]. [Unknown number garbled and lost as his voice fades].

00:23:44.902 --> 00:23:47.143
David Boder: And who [1-2 garbled] buried [these?] [1 garbled]?

00:23:47.143 --> 00:24:16.776

00:38:52.848 --> 00:38:56.944
Vladus Lukosevicius: He doesn’t know about me and I don’t know anything. And I don’t remember the address.

00:38:56.944 --> 00:38:58.330
David Boder: And you don’t know anything about [your] family, right?

00:38:58.330 --> 00:38:59.896
Vladus Lukosevicius: I don’t know anything about [my] family.

00:38:59.896 --> 00:39:01.734
David Boder: And how many children did you have there?

00:39:01.734 --> 00:39:02.589
Vladus Lukosevicius: Two.

00:39:02.589 --> 00:39:03.614
David Boder: How old?

00:39:03.614 --> 00:39:08.475
Vladus Lukosevicius: One is now, now 7, a girl, and the boy will be 3 years old.

00:39:08.475 --> 00:39:10.584
David Boder: So, you have been separated from your family.

00:39:10.584 --> 00:39:12.132
Vladus Lukosevicius: We have been separated.

00:39:12.132 --> 00:39:42.385
David Boder: [In English] Ah...Well, that’s the point on which we conclude the interview with Alfonsas Paulis [sic] at Lohengrinstrasse, the Baltic camp of displaced people, displaced Latvians, Estonians, Lithuanians who are here pending their fate of which most of them don’t know. They know only one thing.

00:39:42.385 --> 00:39:45.277
David Boder: [In Russian] Do you want to return back to Lithuania?

00:39:45.277 --> 00:39:56.253
Vladus Lukosevicius: No, I don’t. I know the Soviets well, since I lived under them 2 years and [2-3 weak and garbled], [and so?] right now I can’t return. No, not one of us can return right now [2-3 garbled].

00:39:56.253 --> 00:40:05.030
David Boder: [In English] He feels he cannot go back, he doesn’t want to go back. And so, a man at the age of 41...

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:06.566
David Boder: [In Russian] Are you 41 years old?

00:40:06.566 --> 00:40:07.651
Vladus Lukosevicius: 33.

00:40:07.651 --> 00:40:16.488
David Boder: [In English] Ah, a man of 33, of the age of 33 is looking for a new country, a new land and a new anchor. This...Ja?

00:40:16.488 --> 00:40:33.996
Vladus Lukosevicius: [In Russian] I would like to [say] very strongly I do not want to return, [so that?] I know, that if, if I return, then I will not see my home [all the same?]. But if as soon as the Americans had arrived that I had gone right away, then perhaps yes, but now it’s already a year [time I did not go?], so I well know that I would not see home if I would want [blocked by Boder].

00:40:33.996 --> 00:40:34.900
David Boder: Why wouldn’t you see home?

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:38.665
Vladus Lukosevicius: [Garbled, only word audible is “they shoot”].

00:40:38.665 --> 00:40:41.557
David Boder: And for what? [In Lithuania you [by no means?] nothing [1 garbled].

00:40:41.557 --> 00:40:47.262
Vladus Lukosevicius: [No, not everything?], but I know how [the Soviets?] are I know better as the others [sic]. They don’t know [the history?].

00:40:47.262 --> 00:40:48.148
David Boder: So.

00:40:48.148 --> 00:42:10.978
David Boder: [In English] It is a fear of getting killed, of being displaced, and the fear of others that transmits itself in a group and grows. They don’t want to go back, they don’t want to go back for their families. This concludes Spool 144, 14- this concludes spool 145...at Lohengrinstrasse in the displaced people’s camp, Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians. Illinois Institute of Technology wire recording. September the 21st, 1946, in a camp maintained by the UNRRA in some special arrangement of the military government with the Germans. Quite some intricate conditions under which these camps are maintained and of which one has to get rather printed material and dated and to get a interview when someone doesn’t know how to ask a question in order to get the proper answer. We are going now over to the Greek Orthodox church to take a part of the services. And tonight we will take the choruses of the Latvians and Lithuanians.
