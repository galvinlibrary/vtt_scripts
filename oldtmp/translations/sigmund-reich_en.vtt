David Boder: [In English] Geneva, August the 26th. Geneva, August the 26th, 1946, at the ORT School. The interviewee is a young man, Sigmund Reich.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:17.925
David Boder: [In German] How old are you?

00:00:17.925 --> 00:00:19.347
Sigmund Reich: [In Yiddish] I am twenty years old.

00:00:19.347 --> 00:00:28.547
David Boder: [In English] Twenty years old. He made his way through various concentration camps, then to Switzerland and the ORT Schools.

00:00:28.547 --> 00:00:34.253
David Boder: [In German] And so, Mr. Reich, tell me again your full name and how old you are. Speak Yiddish.

00:00:34.253 --> 00:00:36.503
Sigmund Reich: [In Yiddish] Yes. I speak Yiddish better.

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:37.003
David Boder: [In English] Yes.

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:42.534
Sigmund Reich: [In Yiddish] I was...I was...I was born in Austria.

00:00:42.534 --> 00:00:43.643
David Boder: In Austria, yes.

00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:47.439
Sigmund Reich: In Austria. But I did not live in Austria long. Only a year and a half.

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:48.048
David Boder: Yes?

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:51.380
Sigmund Reich: Later we went to Belgium. There we were six years, and we went to Poland.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.348
David Boder: Yes.

00:00:52.348 --> 00:00:55.834
Sigmund Reich: In Poland I lived until the war...I was seven years...

00:00:55.834 --> 00:00:56.443
David Boder: Hm.

00:00:56.443 --> 00:00:58.130
Sigmund Reich: Till the beginning of the war.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.615
David Boder: Yes?

00:00:58.615 --> 00:01:02.808
Sigmund Reich: And at the beginning of the war I became sick.

00:01:02.808 --> 00:01:04.819
David Boder: What town in Poland did you live in?

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:05.663
Sigmund Reich: In Kraków.

00:01:05.663 --> 00:01:06.100
David Boder: Where?

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.647
Sigmund Reich: In Kraków.

00:01:06.647 --> 00:01:07.428
David Boder: Kraków?

00:01:07.428 --> 00:01:08.740
Sigmund Reich: Yes. Kraków in Poland.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.068
David Boder: [In German] In Kraków. And so, you lived in Kraków. Yes? Nu?

00:01:12.068 --> 00:01:29.271
Sigmund Reich: [In Yiddish] And I remained there only with the mother. My father already had gone. Rumors...rumors were out that all...all men, Jewish men from eighteen to forty five, will be taken for slave-labor.

00:01:29.271 --> 00:01:29.662
David Boder: Nu?

00:01:29.662 --> 00:01:33.537
Sigmund Reich: Nu, my father was afraid so he left...he left. He left for Lemberg.

00:01:33.537 --> 00:01:34.537
David Boder: Nu?

00:01:34.537 --> 00:01:35.849
Sigmund Reich: So I remained with the mother.

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:37.030
David Boder: Yes?

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:43.411
Sigmund Reich: I remained alone with the mother. And I started to earn...for food...

00:01:43.411 --> 00:01:44.318
David Boder: yes?

00:01:44.318 --> 00:01:55.505
Sigmund Reich: . . . in many ways. I worked with the snow. I worked...eh...eh...I carried packages. I worked once in a store there. Finally I worked with a tailor. So I earned now and then a few groschen [pennies].

00:01:55.505 --> 00:01:59.895
David Boder: Nu? Go on!

00:01:59.895 --> 00:02:07.942
Sigmund Reich: And so in thousand nine hundred and forty was made...made the ghetto in Kraków.

00:02:07.942 --> 00:02:08.770
David Boder: In Kraków?

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:09.302
Sigmund Reich: In Kraków.

00:02:09.302 --> 00:02:09.709
David Boder: Yes?

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:21.586
Sigmund Reich: They deported...all...the whole...all the Jews of Kraków were deported to...to Podgorz, the second [a certain] part. That means, the...ah...were...many were deported.

00:02:21.586 --> 00:02:22.008
David Boder: Yes?

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:46.988
Sigmund Reich: But...but there were left something like thirty...thirty thousand people. The rest were deported. I too was deported with the...with the...with my mother. There were...I also had there a grandmother with a grandfather. And so, we were deported. My grandfather and grandmother [?] went to Tarnow, and I went thirty-two kilometers from...from Tarnow to Radomyszl Wielki.

00:02:46.988 --> 00:02:47.706
David Boder: By yourself?

00:02:47.706 --> 00:02:48.801
Sigmund Reich: Just with the mother.

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:49.699
David Boder: With the mother. Nu?

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:54.035
Sigmund Reich: We went there...we stayed there with...with my mother’s sister.

00:02:54.035 --> 00:02:54.723
David Boder: Yes?

00:02:54.723 --> 00:02:57.199
Sigmund Reich: There...there I already had to work.

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:58.488
David Boder: Where was your father?

00:02:58.488 --> 00:03:03.191
Sigmund Reich: My father was in Lemberg...when...until...until the ‘Russian’ war.

00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:03.753
David Boder: Nu?

00:03:03.753 --> 00:03:10.612
Sigmund Reich: Later...I have now received a letter from my uncle in Belgium that he received news from Dombrau.

00:03:10.612 --> 00:03:11.315
David Boder: Hm.

00:03:11.315 --> 00:03:12.987
Sigmund Reich: I know no more.

00:03:12.987 --> 00:03:14.629
David Boder: But Dombrau is Russia?

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:15.781
Sigmund Reich: Russia.

00:03:15.781 --> 00:03:16.513
David Boder: You don’t know anything more?

00:03:16.513 --> 00:03:17.007
Sigmund Reich: I know no more.

00:03:17.007 --> 00:03:18.946
David Boder: Nu? And so?

00:03:18.946 --> 00:03:26.839
Sigmund Reich: We esc-...esc-...escaped to Radomysl. There we still received a few letters...a few letters.

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:27.402
David Boder: From whom?

00:03:27.402 --> 00:03:43.392
Sigmund Reich: From the father. And that...on this...later the ‘Russian’ war broke out, and the Germans gave an order that from every family one man must present himself so that the family can remain [in the place].

00:03:43.392 --> 00:03:44.111
David Boder: Yes?

00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:47.951
Sigmund Reich: Nu, so I...so I did thus I...

00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:49.126
David Boder: How old were you then?

00:03:49.126 --> 00:03:51.157
Sigmund Reich: About thirteen, over thirteen years.

00:03:51.157 --> 00:03:51.563
David Boder: Yes?

00:03:51.563 --> 00:03:56.210
Sigmund Reich: I was...I did thus. I wanted for my mother to remain there in the town.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.578
David Boder: Yes?

00:03:56.578 --> 00:03:59.531
Sigmund Reich: I went and reported.

00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:00.093
David Boder: Hm.

00:04:00.093 --> 00:04:06.097
Sigmund Reich: I reported and came to the square...I cannot remember what day it was.

00:04:06.097 --> 00:04:07.488
David Boder: That is not important.

00:04:07.488 --> 00:04:13.628
Sigmund Reich: So I went to the concentration...to the lager. It was promised [that] every three weeks we will be able to go home.

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:14.065
David Boder: Yes?

00:04:14.065 --> 00:04:21.135
Sigmund Reich: In the meantime only two weeks passed and the whole town was depopulated [of Jews]. Since then I have no more word. Not from the mother, not from anybody.

00:04:21.135 --> 00:04:25.401
David Boder: How come? You went to work?

00:04:25.401 --> 00:04:28.760
Sigmund Reich: Yes. It was said to a lager in a nearby town.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.213
David Boder: Yes.

00:04:29.213 --> 00:04:32.510
Sigmund Reich: It was said every three weeks we will have leave.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.291
David Boder: Nu?

00:04:33.291 --> 00:04:39.822
Sigmund Reich: And so, well, only two weeks passed, the whole town was...was depopulated. They were...

00:04:39.822 --> 00:04:40.901
David Boder: They were...

00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:43.365
Sigmund Reich: They were sent...deported. And since then there is no word [from them] at all.

00:04:43.365 --> 00:04:43.864
David Boder: Yes?

00:04:43.864 --> 00:04:46.244
Sigmund Reich: Not at all. From the whole transport there is no word.

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:46.744
David Boder: Yes?

00:04:46.744 --> 00:04:56.165
Sigmund Reich: And later I came. There was Mielec [?]. We worked mostly at flying...I personally worked there at flying machines.

00:04:56.165 --> 00:04:56.836
David Boder: Yes?

00:04:56.836 --> 00:04:57.548
Sigmund Reich: There we worked...

00:04:57.548 --> 00:04:59.213
David Boder: And you didn’t hear from the mother?

00:04:59.213 --> 00:05:00.007
Sigmund Reich: Nothing.

00:05:00.007 --> 00:05:01.749
David Boder: Did you hear anything afterwards?

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:02.538
Sigmund Reich: No, nothing.

00:05:02.538 --> 00:05:03.398
David Boder: Nothing. Nu.

00:05:03.398 --> 00:05:15.866
Sigmund Reich: And somehow we managed. We...we...stole some potatoes...and other things only to maintain a hold of that little piece of soul.

00:05:15.866 --> 00:05:16.584
David Boder: Hm.

00:05:16.584 --> 00:05:36.257
Sigmund Reich: Thus we spent there two years. After the two years, when the Russians began to approach, they were near Rzeszow, we were evacuated. We were evacuated to Germany. Then we travelled through Auschwitz, then through Plaszow [?]. We thought we will remain somewhere in a lager there, but we were farther...

00:05:36.257 --> 00:05:37.851
David Boder: How long have you been in Auschwitz?

00:05:37.851 --> 00:05:40.570
Sigmund Reich: In Auschwitz...we were there only a few hours in the RR-cars.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:41.852
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:05:41.852 --> 00:05:43.008
Sigmund Reich: Afterwards we travelled on.

00:05:43.008 --> 00:05:43.758
David Boder: Yes?

00:05:43.758 --> 00:05:44.242
Sigmund Reich: We...

00:05:44.242 --> 00:05:46.892
David Boder: Now who were you? Men...men or [and] women?

00:05:46.892 --> 00:05:52.149
Sigmund Reich: Men only. There were about a hundred women, but they were...I think they were taken off in Auschwitz.

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:54.428
David Boder: Yes. And otherwise you were men only?

00:05:54.428 --> 00:05:55.272
Sigmund Reich: Men only.

00:05:55.272 --> 00:05:56.443
David Boder: How many men to a RR-car?

00:05:56.443 --> 00:06:00.021
Sigmund Reich: In a RR-car could have been eighty, ninety men.

00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:03.348
David Boder: Were you let out if one had to go?

00:06:03.348 --> 00:06:07.802
Sigmund Reich: Yes, not...not always, not always. Once a day, twice a day they let us out.

00:06:07.802 --> 00:06:10.759
David Boder: Nu, you all were a labor force.

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:18.220
Sigmund Reich: Labor force. We were...they said we were demanded by the Heinkel Airplane Works.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.661
David Boder: Oh. The Heinkel Airplane Works?

00:06:19.661 --> 00:06:20.005
Sigmund Reich: Yes.

00:06:20.005 --> 00:06:20.411
David Boder: Nu?

00:06:20.411 --> 00:07:04.660
Sigmund Reich: We were demanded for Germany, because we were good workers. Nu, we were...we went to Germany. We came to Flossenburg, maybe six kilometers from the Sudet-...Czecho-Sudeten border. There...there was one of the worst lagers. A lager of the third...third class. Only professional criminals [so-called BV’s]. German criminals. Lately also Russians came and different nationalities. They were all sent to that lager. In the camp there, I spent also...I spent also...maybe...maybe a...a year. Not a full year. Later, when the Russians approached, we were again transferred. There were also airplane works, Messerschmitt...

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:05.129
David Boder: Yes?

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:15.757
Sigmund Reich: Later, we were...from there we were taken to Kamenz. Maybe...seven hundred men. In Kamenz it was very...it was very...was already very bad. It was a ‘Commando’ from Grossrosen.

00:07:15.757 --> 00:07:16.445
David Boder: From where?

00:07:16.445 --> 00:07:17.461
Sigmund Reich: Grossrosen.

00:07:17.461 --> 00:07:18.117
David Boder: Yes?

00:07:18.117 --> 00:07:25.609
Sigmund Reich: The ‘Commando’ leader was a very, very bad...[no sound from the wire].

00:07:25.609 --> 00:07:27.955
David Boder: You said he was a bad man?

00:07:27.955 --> 00:07:28.211
Sigmund Reich: Very bad.

00:07:28.211 --> 00:07:29.905
David Boder: How long did you live there?

00:07:29.905 --> 00:08:00.644
Sigmund Reich: It is like this. In the beginning we were...it was...we worked there. There was a mechanical section, by machines. We worked with lathes. Later, when we already...we already heard that the Russians are approaching, the work stopped. We didn’t work there any more. We were sent...It was already winter then. Then we were sent to dismantle barracks. That means the wooden houses that were built there. A lager was once there, or something. So...so they ordered us to dismantle them.

00:08:00.644 --> 00:08:02.503
David Boder: To dismantle them.

00:08:02.503 --> 00:08:02.909
Sigmund Reich: Yes.

00:08:02.909 --> 00:08:04.409
David Boder: What was done with the wood?

00:08:04.409 --> 00:08:17.695
Sigmund Reich: With the wood? It was piled up. We had to carry it for a...maybe a half kilometer to...to the unloading place. And an auto came there and we had to...and later we had to load it on an auto.

00:08:17.695 --> 00:08:18.851
David Boder: Yes? Nu?

00:08:18.851 --> 00:08:22.899
Sigmund Reich: The food there was very, very, very bad. It was plain water.

00:08:22.899 --> 00:08:23.618
David Boder: Yes?

00:08:23.618 --> 00:09:04.825
Sigmund Reich: It was bad generally in all the lagers, but there it was worse than anywhere else. There it was plain water. We received an eighth of a bread. And on this...on this we lived the whole day. We lay on straw. The straw was altogether neglected. There was a lot...a lot of dirt in it. Nobody cared any more. Towards the end, when they ordered [us] to evacuate the lager, a lot...a lot of people were annihilated there. Also a lot became sick, so that from all...there were still about a thousand five...eh...thousand five...five hundred men or about that. We were...we were left only six or...or...or six fifty...six hundred and fifty people.

00:09:04.825 --> 00:09:06.715
David Boder: What does it mean, they were annihilated?

00:09:06.715 --> 00:09:11.418
Sigmund Reich: They were...it was...we were inoculated there. There they were inoculated.

00:09:11.418 --> 00:09:12.512
David Boder: What does it mean, they were inoculated?

00:09:12.512 --> 00:09:14.980
Sigmund Reich: They were given hypodermics. Injections.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:15.226
David Boder: [In English] Yes.

00:09:15.226 --> 00:09:16.105
David Boder: [In Yiddish] And what happened then?

00:09:16.105 --> 00:09:21.016
Sigmund Reich: They were put to sleep. After the injections, a few hours after the injections, six hours, he was...the man was dead.

00:09:21.016 --> 00:09:22.657
David Boder: In which camp was that?

00:09:22.657 --> 00:09:23.251
Sigmund Reich: Kamenz

00:09:23.251 --> 00:09:24.079
David Boder: Kamenz?

00:09:24.079 --> 00:09:25.173
Sigmund Reich: It is near Dresden.

00:09:25.173 --> 00:09:27.689
David Boder: Near Dresden. What is the name of it? Kamenz?

00:09:27.689 --> 00:09:34.032
Sigmund Reich: Kamenz. K-A-M-E-N-Z.

00:09:34.032 --> 00:09:35.578
David Boder: E-N...?

00:09:35.578 --> 00:09:36.109
Sigmund Reich: Z?

00:09:36.109 --> 00:09:37.421
David Boder: Kamenz?

00:09:37.421 --> 00:09:38.296
Sigmund Reich: Yes, yes.

00:09:38.296 --> 00:09:43.286
David Boder: Now were you [too] given an injection?

00:09:43.286 --> 00:09:52.085
Sigmund Reich: Not us. To those that they saw...the men can’t...can’t...that they can’t hold out [any more].

00:09:52.085 --> 00:09:55.066
David Boder: What were the people called who were very weak.

00:09:55.066 --> 00:09:56.097
Sigmund Reich: They are sick.

00:09:56.097 --> 00:09:59.565
David Boder: Wasn’t there a special name for them?

00:09:59.565 --> 00:10:00.986
Sigmund Reich: No.

00:10:00.986 --> 00:10:03.282
David Boder: What was a Musselman? Have you heard?

00:10:03.282 --> 00:10:06.766
Sigmund Reich: Musselman, that...they were people who were completely sick.

00:10:06.766 --> 00:10:07.422
David Boder: Nu?

00:10:07.422 --> 00:10:09.969
Sigmund Reich: People who simply could not walk any more.

00:10:09.969 --> 00:10:11.853
David Boder: So, what was done? They made...

00:10:11.853 --> 00:10:17.765
Sigmund Reich: They were...in one lager they were inoculated. In another, other methods were used.

00:10:17.765 --> 00:10:18.577
David Boder: For instance?

00:10:18.577 --> 00:10:23.053
Sigmund Reich: There where I was...in Kamenz they were given inoculations. Everybody...these that they saw that...

00:10:23.053 --> 00:10:24.780
David Boder: Were they taken into a sick ward? Or...

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:35.333
Sigmund Reich: Into the sick ward. There was...on the...they were taken up on the second floor. There was the sick ward. One was called in and the people were inoculated and after five, six hours they were dead.

00:10:35.333 --> 00:10:37.067
David Boder: Did he know what was going on?

00:10:37.067 --> 00:10:39.461
Sigmund Reich: We...those people didn’t know.

00:10:39.461 --> 00:10:40.118
David Boder: Yes.

00:10:40.118 --> 00:10:51.342
Sigmund Reich: However, later on these...later we saw that they do not come down any more, and once we noticed one was being carried down, who we knew went upstairs. We knew that if they are called it was done to them.

00:10:51.342 --> 00:10:53.601
David Boder: And what was done there with the dead?

00:10:53.601 --> 00:10:59.272
Sigmund Reich: With the dead? They were...there was a boiler that was heated for central heating.

00:10:59.272 --> 00:11:00.959
David Boder: What kind of a boiler did you say?

00:11:00.959 --> 00:11:04.073
Sigmund Reich: That...that was [used for] central heating. Water was there...

00:11:04.073 --> 00:11:04.761
David Boder: Yes?

00:11:04.761 --> 00:11:05.792
Sigmund Reich: It heated the whole house.

00:11:05.792 --> 00:11:06.354
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:06.354 --> 00:11:28.023
Sigmund Reich: Such a boiler we fired underneath, and the people were thrown in there. They were burned. Once it was a textile plant. I don’t know for sure of what. And the factory was...the factory was...was liquidated. And into this factory we were sent and we were there some four or five months.

00:11:28.023 --> 00:11:28.554
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:28.554 --> 00:11:36.556
Sigmund Reich: Afterwards the Russians approached. We were evacuated. We travelled for fourteen days. They didn’t...we weren’t given even a drop of water.

00:11:36.556 --> 00:11:39.025
David Boder: Nu? And where did you go then?

00:11:39.025 --> 00:11:42.056
Sigmund Reich: Then we already travelled to...to Dachau.

00:11:42.056 --> 00:11:43.978
David Boder: Nu. What happened in Dachau?

00:11:43.978 --> 00:11:58.102
Sigmund Reich: In Dachau I was already...in Dachau I was already altogether weak. There we didn’t work any more. We were already like Musselmen one can say. Everybody was. Only a few exceptions were...were still well.

00:11:58.102 --> 00:11:58.727
David Boder: Nu?

00:11:58.727 --> 00:12:12.492
Sigmund Reich: And...and only these who were well, these were taken and sent away with a ‘transport.’ Because...because lately the Americans bombed the place terribly—Munich, the whole region.

00:12:12.492 --> 00:12:13.336
David Boder: Nu?

00:12:13.336 --> 00:12:21.976
Sigmund Reich: So every...we knew every time that at one o’clock at night, at twelve midnight, the Americans came and...and bombed the region.

00:12:21.976 --> 00:12:22.648
David Boder: Nu.

00:12:22.648 --> 00:12:31.335
Sigmund Reich: They always threw...when they flew over...over our lager, they always threw the flares, such rockets that illuminated.

00:12:31.335 --> 00:12:31.897
David Boder: Yes?

00:12:31.897 --> 00:12:37.769
Sigmund Reich: And so they knew...they saw what was going on the...on the ground. They knew where the lager was.

00:12:37.769 --> 00:12:38.206
David Boder: Aha.

00:12:38.206 --> 00:12:39.987
Sigmund Reich: The camp was never bombed.

00:12:39.987 --> 00:12:41.627
David Boder: The lager was never bombarded?

00:12:41.627 --> 00:12:42.659
Sigmund Reich: No. Never.

00:12:42.659 --> 00:12:43.503
David Boder: Nu?

00:12:43.503 --> 00:13:01.346
Sigmund Reich: And so it became worse and worse. The Americans came nearer. We were two thousand Jews there, but a thousand could not walk. There was a total of one thousand six hundred men.

00:13:01.346 --> 00:13:01.815
David Boder: Yes?

00:13:01.815 --> 00:13:04.690
Sigmund Reich: These were still able to walk, but not all.

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:05.049
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:05.049 --> 00:13:13.736
Sigmund Reich: The rest were already so sick. They had swollen legs, or else they were swollen all over. They were so weakened they really couldn’t make a [single] step.

00:13:13.736 --> 00:13:14.423
David Boder: Nu?

00:13:14.423 --> 00:13:45.238
Sigmund Reich: And we...we were called to appell. All the Jews in Dachau were...all Jews were called together. They were called out by name. On the twenty-fourth was the first appell. On the twenty-fifth we were also again...again called together. And on the twenty-seventh, in the morning, we were awakened very early, five o’clock. We were...were made to stand in rows and we...were later taken to the...to the RR-cars.

00:13:45.238 --> 00:13:46.113
David Boder: Yes?

00:13:46.113 --> 00:13:49.858
Sigmund Reich: We were taken to the RR-cars. To every RR-car was a hundred people.

00:13:49.858 --> 00:13:50.327
David Boder: Nu?

00:13:50.327 --> 00:14:12.019
Sigmund Reich: They did not...they did not have any more freight...freight...cars, so they gave such half-passenger RR-cars [4th class] for the trip. However, they piled in so many, we were hardly able to stand. And so we travelled as far as a certain station of Austria. There the tracks were blown up, and we had to...we had to get off.

00:14:12.019 --> 00:14:13.112
David Boder: Yes?

00:14:13.112 --> 00:15:25.023
Sigmund Reich: So we got off and they told us that we still had to walk twenty kilometers to the next station, so that we could continue to travel. So when they...they have this...we stopped. We were ordered to march. We marched six kilometers. It started to snow. It already was dark. It was winter. They started to billet us with the peasants, billeted there where they keep straw and all such things. We were billeted there. Our RR-car was exactly the last to be billeted. We were...everyone was told...there were soldiers...a few...that every soldier should take a few men and should go to the village and look for quarters. Nu, we have...with us, too, went a soldier. We were something like nine...nine men. We went with him. While he went upstairs to look for quarters, we...we walked away. So we wandered...wandered till we came to Switzerland. We walked about four, five kilometers, and we met a...

00:15:25.023 --> 00:15:30.668
David Boder: Wait a moment. When did you go...separate yourself? When did you run away from there?

00:15:30.668 --> 00:15:34.932
Sigmund Reich: We ran away perhaps on the twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth.

00:15:34.932 --> 00:15:36.303
David Boder: How many ran away?

00:15:36.303 --> 00:15:37.074
Sigmund Reich: Nine men.

00:15:37.074 --> 00:15:37.730
David Boder: Nine men?

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:38.418
Sigmund Reich: Yes.

00:15:38.418 --> 00:15:40.637
David Boder: And you were able to walk through Germany?

00:15:40.637 --> 00:16:01.018
Sigmund Reich: We had...we had prepared an excuse that the Red Cross had demanded us. We had an excuse that the Red Cross had demanded us. We had such packages. Before we left we were given packages from Belgium, from the Belgium Red Cross. There were canned foods. There were cigarettes, some biscuits, and that was the whole package.

00:16:01.018 --> 00:16:06.767
David Boder: Now wait. I do not understand. When were you the last time with the Germans? In Dachau?

00:16:06.767 --> 00:16:09.109
Sigmund Reich: In Dachau. We left on the twenty-seventh.

00:16:09.109 --> 00:16:10.308
David Boder: Nu? And then?

00:16:10.308 --> 00:16:13.495
Sigmund Reich: We travelled maybe for a day or two. I can’t tell for sure.

00:16:13.495 --> 00:16:13.995
David Boder: Nu?

00:16:13.995 --> 00:16:18.284
Sigmund Reich: And then later, we couldn’t continue to travel, because the tracks were blown up.

00:16:18.284 --> 00:16:18.941
David Boder: [In English] Yes?

00:16:18.941 --> 00:16:23.644
Sigmund Reich: [In Yiddish] And it was blown up so we had to get off the train.

00:16:23.644 --> 00:16:24.253
David Boder: Yes?

00:16:24.253 --> 00:16:26.534
Sigmund Reich: And we had to...we had to march on...

00:16:26.534 --> 00:16:27.331
David Boder: Yes?

00:16:27.331 --> 00:16:32.280
Sigmund Reich: . . . for another twenty kilometers so that we could reach another station where the connection could be made to go on.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:32.851
David Boder: Yes?

00:16:32.851 --> 00:16:39.241
Sigmund Reich: We...we only walked six kilometers before night fell and it began to snow.

00:16:39.241 --> 00:16:39.772
David Boder: Yes.

00:16:39.772 --> 00:16:44.915
Sigmund Reich: It was winter, and we...we began to be billeted there with the peasants.

00:16:44.915 --> 00:16:45.531
David Boder: Peasants?

00:16:45.531 --> 00:16:45.993
Sigmund Reich: Yes.

00:16:45.993 --> 00:16:46.430
David Boder: Nu?

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:49.512
Sigmund Reich: We were put in a barn where one keeps straw.

00:16:49.512 --> 00:16:51.805
David Boder: [In German] Yes. You were Polish prisoners?

00:16:51.805 --> 00:16:52.921
Sigmund Reich: [In Yiddish] What? We were...

00:16:52.921 --> 00:16:53.185
David Boder: Yes.

00:16:53.185 --> 00:16:57.210
Sigmund Reich: . . . political prisoners. All the Jews had red badges as political [prisoners]. [See Note 1 at end of chapter, page 31 - (2185).]

00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:57.632
David Boder: Nu?

00:16:57.632 --> 00:17:03.429
Sigmund Reich: And our...our RR-car fell short on lodgings.

00:17:03.429 --> 00:17:03.960
David Boder: Yes?

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:12.746
Sigmund Reich: So the Kommando-fuehrer ordered that each soldier should take six or seven men up to ten men, and go to look for something like...

00:17:12.746 --> 00:17:13.612
David Boder: Where to stop [?].

00:17:13.612 --> 00:17:16.630
Sigmund Reich: Yes. To look for a place to sleep at night.

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:17.294
David Boder: Nu?

00:17:17.294 --> 00:17:27.064
Sigmund Reich: So with us went...we had a soldier who went with us. He went upstairs to look for...to look for a night’s lodging, so...so we walked away.

00:17:27.064 --> 00:17:28.220
David Boder: You ran away.

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.126
Sigmund Reich: We walked away.

00:17:29.126 --> 00:17:29.657
David Boder: Nu?

00:17:29.657 --> 00:17:41.808
Sigmund Reich: Simply walked away. Later...we wandered the whole night till we came to a village...into a German village, and we said that we were...someone came up to us on the road...something like from the Security Police.

00:17:41.808 --> 00:17:42.277
David Boder: [In English] Yes?

00:17:42.277 --> 00:17:46.167
Sigmund Reich: [In Yiddish] From the Red...possibly from the Red Cross, I don’t remember exactly...

00:17:46.167 --> 00:17:46.604
David Boder: Hm.

00:17:46.604 --> 00:17:57.744
Sigmund Reich: . . . who he was. And he took us to the mayor. There we were, so we said we are...we are...we are lost from a transport, and our transport is supposed to go to Switzerland.

00:17:57.744 --> 00:18:01.775
David Boder: Oh! Nu? And how far were you from Switzerland?

00:18:01.775 --> 00:18:03.931
Sigmund Reich: We were a hundred and fifty kilometers [?].

00:18:03.931 --> 00:18:07.493
David Boder: Nu? So how could you go on? Were there no SS?

00:18:07.493 --> 00:18:11.508
Sigmund Reich: There...there were no SS in the town.

00:18:11.508 --> 00:18:11.726
David Boder: Nu?

00:18:11.726 --> 00:18:19.670
Sigmund Reich: Perhaps such...perhaps those who were...because all of them were at the front, except maybe such...except such who couldn’t [were in no condition] to be at the front.

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:22.617
David Boder: So where did you meet the man from the Red Cross?

00:18:22.617 --> 00:18:25.804
Sigmund Reich: He met us...we walked along the road. So he met us.

00:18:25.804 --> 00:18:26.226
David Boder: Yes?

00:18:26.226 --> 00:18:35.335
Sigmund Reich: And he...he...he took us to the mayor. He said he came upon us on the road, and we told the mayor that we were demanded by the Red Cross to go to Switzerland.

00:18:35.335 --> 00:18:36.179
David Boder: Hm.

00:18:36.179 --> 00:18:41.659
Sigmund Reich: Nu. We were...were...like...He became confused so that he believed us, our story.

00:18:41.659 --> 00:18:44.448
David Boder: Yes. Nu? So he let you go [?]?

00:18:44.448 --> 00:18:51.740
Sigmund Reich: He did. He even gave us a little soup there...and...eh...and he led us to...to the road that...

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.506
David Boder: Yes.

00:18:53.506 --> 00:18:54.646
Sigmund Reich: . . . leads to Switzerland.

00:18:54.646 --> 00:18:54.898
David Boder: Yes.

00:18:54.898 --> 00:19:00.947
Sigmund Reich: He told the soldier to let us go on this road because we are demanded by the Red Cross to go to Switzerland.

00:19:00.947 --> 00:19:02.052
David Boder: Nu?

00:19:02.052 --> 00:19:16.304
Sigmund Reich: Nu, we went along the road and we came to another village. We wanted to stay there overnight, but the mayor didn’t want to. He was very mean, that mayor. [A commotion in the room.]

00:19:16.304 --> 00:19:19.069
David Boder: All right, why didn’t he want to? Why?

00:19:19.069 --> 00:19:33.312
Sigmund Reich: He said he had many soldiers...now...and everytime come...[the spool ends abrutply]

00:19:33.312 --> 00:19:40.931
David Boder: [In English] Also...this is Spool 74, continuation of 73, Sigmund Reich, the interviewee.

00:19:40.931 --> 00:19:44.084
David Boder: [In Yiddish] And so, you came to another city.

00:19:44.084 --> 00:19:44.553
Sigmund Reich: Yes.

00:19:44.553 --> 00:19:49.335
David Boder: And you came to the mayor and told him you were demanded by the Red Cross?

00:19:49.335 --> 00:19:49.685
Sigmund Reich: Yes.

00:19:49.685 --> 00:19:51.974
David Boder: Didn’t he ask [you] for papers, or anything?

00:19:51.974 --> 00:19:53.099
Sigmund Reich: He didn’t ask anything.

00:19:53.099 --> 00:19:55.005
David Boder: When was it, in ’45 already?

00:19:55.005 --> 00:19:55.521
Sigmund Reich: In ’45.

00:19:55.521 --> 00:19:56.207
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:19:56.207 --> 00:20:01.482
Sigmund Reich: And we came later to a little town...

00:20:01.482 --> 00:20:01.956
David Boder: Yes?

00:20:01.956 --> 00:20:13.675
Sigmund Reich: . . . into a little town, and there we presented [?] ourselves, but the mayor didn’t...didn’t permit it. He said there were many soldiers, and he didn’t have room for us.

00:20:13.675 --> 00:20:13.988
David Boder: Yes?

00:20:13.988 --> 00:20:24.534
Sigmund Reich: And so, we walked on. We had no choice, and we came upon a peasant who was working. He was one of...one of the railroad employees.

00:20:24.534 --> 00:20:25.081
David Boder: Yes?

00:20:25.081 --> 00:20:40.605
Sigmund Reich: We went over and begged him about...he should...he should let us stay in the barn overnight. He said he had a small...a small barn, where he keeps a few leaves that he needs for the cows and also the horses.

00:20:40.605 --> 00:20:41.386
David Boder: Leaves?

00:20:41.386 --> 00:20:42.573
Sigmund Reich: Leaves, leaves.

00:20:42.573 --> 00:20:43.370
David Boder: Leaves. Yes?

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:52.116
Sigmund Reich: And it is very small and all of us would not have enough room. We said, ‘No, there surely will be enough room.’ He should let us in.

00:20:52.116 --> 00:20:54.248
David Boder: Did he ask you who you were?

00:20:54.248 --> 00:21:00.091
Sigmund Reich: He asked us. We told him that the Red Army...[corrects himself] we told him that the Red Cross demanded [invited] us to Switzerland.

00:21:00.091 --> 00:21:00.747
David Boder: Nu?

00:21:00.747 --> 00:21:24.332
Sigmund Reich: And so he...he let us in. He later even brought us a little milk, and in...in the morning we found out that he is a railroad...railroad employee. Se we asked him whether he could not arrange it so that we could travel to the Swiss border. He said, ‘Yes, I will be able to arrange everything.’ He said we should...that at seven o’clock...I cannot remember at what time...we should come to the station and we will be able to board the train.

00:21:24.332 --> 00:21:24.895
David Boder: Nu?

00:21:24.895 --> 00:21:31.103
Sigmund Reich: So we...in the morning we got up, we washed up, and we ate there something.

00:21:31.103 --> 00:21:33.259
David Boder: What kind of clothes...what kind of clothes did you wear?

00:21:33.259 --> 00:21:37.560
Sigmund Reich: We have...I had civilian [clothes] but the others had those...

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.592
David Boder: Striped suits. Nu?

00:21:38.592 --> 00:21:39.784
Sigmund Reich: Striped suits.

00:21:39.784 --> 00:21:40.315
David Boder: Nu?

00:21:40.315 --> 00:21:50.116
Sigmund Reich: And...and later we came to the railroad station. There we sat at the station and we waited for the train. The train came and we got on. We...

00:21:50.116 --> 00:21:50.881
David Boder: Without tickets?

00:21:50.881 --> 00:21:57.369
Sigmund Reich: Well, without tickets. He ordered it, so that we could ride without tickets. Later we travelled till...

00:21:57.369 --> 00:21:59.397
David Boder: Who was he, the station master?

00:21:59.397 --> 00:22:04.020
Sigmund Reich: No. He was a...this was a small station and he was the railroad employee [in charge].

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:04.959
David Boder: Aha. Nu?

00:22:04.959 --> 00:22:08.618
Sigmund Reich: And...we...we boarded the train and we rode...

00:22:08.618 --> 00:22:09.708
David Boder: Was he a German?

00:22:09.708 --> 00:22:10.240
Sigmund Reich: Yes.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:10.818
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:10.818 --> 00:22:32.507
Sigmund Reich: . . . and we rode till Bludenz. There we got off and...and we went...we went straight to the German police, and we told them to give us some paper so that we could travel on, till the Swiss border. He said like this: He can’t give us any paper. He can give us a permit to travel on.

00:22:32.507 --> 00:22:33.060
David Boder: Yes?

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:33.816
Sigmund Reich: So.

00:22:33.816 --> 00:22:35.704
David Boder: He can...he can give you a ticket.

00:22:35.704 --> 00:22:39.778
Sigmund Reich: A ticket. But a paper that...that we were liberated...

00:22:39.778 --> 00:22:40.341
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:40.341 --> 00:22:43.459
Sigmund Reich: . . . that we are allowed to travel, he couldn’t give us. And so...

00:22:43.459 --> 00:22:45.296
David Boder: Did you tell him you were prisoners?

00:22:45.296 --> 00:22:46.895
Sigmund Reich: Yes. We told him...

00:22:46.895 --> 00:22:48.590
David Boder: He was the mayor, yes?

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:50.894
Sigmund Reich: It was in Bludenz. He was not the mayor...

00:22:50.894 --> 00:22:51.613
David Boder: A policeman?

00:22:51.613 --> 00:22:52.669
Sigmund Reich: Policeman.

00:22:52.669 --> 00:22:53.137
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:53.137 --> 00:23:01.450
Sigmund Reich: A German policeman. Later he told us to go somewhere where we...where we were supposed to get the money. We went to get the money, and later we went...

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:02.601
David Boder: Where were you to get the money?

00:23:02.601 --> 00:23:05.866
Sigmund Reich: There was some office. He sent us there.

00:23:05.866 --> 00:23:06.366
David Boder: Nu?

00:23:06.366 --> 00:23:17.614
Sigmund Reich: There we received the money, and we went to buy the tickets. We went to buy the tickets. The train wasn’t leaving till nine o’clock. At nine o’clock we came to the train station, and we...

00:23:17.614 --> 00:23:20.724
David Boder: [Amused] And you were not afraid? You had run away?

00:23:20.724 --> 00:23:26.023
Sigmund Reich: [Laughing.] What was there to fear? We took a chance to the finish. If we succeed, we succeed! If we don’t succeed, we don’t succeed!

00:23:26.023 --> 00:23:26.817
David Boder: Nu?

00:23:26.817 --> 00:23:39.809
Sigmund Reich: And so at nine [o’clock] we went into the sleeping cars, and later, about ten o’clock, the train left so we...about eleven o’clock we were in...in Feldkirch.

00:23:39.809 --> 00:23:40.351
David Boder: Feld-...

00:23:40.351 --> 00:23:50.739
Sigmund Reich: Feldkirch. That is near the Swiss border. There we already knew...we knew we had to wait till the morning. In the morning we waited. We started. We went over to the border. There was...

00:23:50.739 --> 00:23:52.931
David Boder: Were there no SS men?

00:23:52.931 --> 00:23:54.753
Sigmund Reich: No. At the border stood the Wehrmacht.

00:23:54.753 --> 00:23:55.207
David Boder: Nu?

00:23:55.207 --> 00:24:09.715
Sigmund Reich: And so, we saw that we couldn’t go over. We saw there some sort of a...a...higher official. We asked him to arrange for us so we could pass, because we are completely exhausted and we...and we want only to get to a hospital of the Red Cross.

00:24:09.715 --> 00:24:10.528
David Boder: Nu?

00:24:10.528 --> 00:24:19.456
Sigmund Reich: We were invited [by the Red Cross]. And so he said that he will take care of everything. We had...we had a few potatoes with us, so we even cooked them there.

00:24:19.456 --> 00:24:20.441
David Boder: Yes?

00:24:20.441 --> 00:24:35.212
Sigmund Reich: And this was our breakfast and our dinner. Later, we...we started to shove to the border. We saw...people started to shove to the border. In general not many people were permitted to pass. Every day a few. And so...

00:24:35.212 --> 00:24:37.073
David Boder: Germans too? Or...

00:24:37.073 --> 00:24:39.104
Sigmund Reich: No, no. They were mostly foreigners.

00:24:39.104 --> 00:24:39.698
David Boder: Nu.

00:24:39.698 --> 00:24:58.394
Sigmund Reich: And...and when we saw they are shoving, and they saw that we wouldn’t get through, then we...so we also started to push ourselves and we pushed ourselves near the wires, I was already very weak, and we...we started to cry for help. And so a German sentry came over.

00:24:58.394 --> 00:24:59.513
David Boder: A German or a Swiss?

00:24:59.513 --> 00:25:11.412
Sigmund Reich: A German, a German, a German. We told him we want only...only to get to a hospital because we are completely exhausted. Well, he said he couldn’t do anything. He called over the Swiss sentry.

00:25:11.412 --> 00:25:11.750
David Boder: Hm.

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:14.267
Sigmund Reich: The Swiss sentry called over the...the...

00:25:14.267 --> 00:25:14.438
David Boder: Officer?

00:25:14.438 --> 00:25:26.598
Sigmund Reich: The officer. We told him we only want to get to a hospital, because we are completely exhausted. So he immediately ordered to let us pass. There...it was...it was somewhere near Lichtenstein.

00:25:26.598 --> 00:25:27.504
David Boder: Yes?

00:25:27.504 --> 00:25:46.143
Sigmund Reich: And there we were...we were...were soon given biscuits to eat, coffee to drink, light things that we...we could eat. And we were told...right away there came a...a certain doctor. I forgot his name, and...

00:25:46.143 --> 00:25:46.893
David Boder: A Jew?

00:25:46.893 --> 00:25:54.788
Sigmund Reich: A Jew, a Jew, and he talked with us. There were even journalists from America. I think there was even a Jewish woman-journalist.

00:25:54.788 --> 00:25:55.444
David Boder: Yes?

00:25:55.444 --> 00:26:01.694
Sigmund Reich: I can’t say for certain. And later we were taken into an auto, and we were driven to a hospital in Buchs [?].

00:26:01.694 --> 00:26:02.330
David Boder: Hm.

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:22.101
Sigmund Reich: We were there something like two weeks. We were treated very well there. We didn’t eat any bread because it was forbidden by the doctor, but we ate only biscuits and light things. Later we were already bett-...recovered, and we received some clothing, and we already received bread.

00:26:22.101 --> 00:26:24.023
David Boder: [Verifying the word] You mean clothes, yes?

00:26:24.023 --> 00:26:25.273
Sigmund Reich: Yes. Civilian clothes.

00:26:25.273 --> 00:26:25.898
David Boder: Nu?

00:26:25.898 --> 00:26:30.508
Sigmund Reich: And after the two weeks we came, here in Switzerland, to a quarantine camp, Gattikon [?].

00:26:30.508 --> 00:26:31.011
David Boder: [In German] What?

00:26:31.011 --> 00:26:31.783
Sigmund Reich: Gattikon [?].

00:26:31.783 --> 00:26:32.111
David Boder: Yes?

00:26:32.111 --> 00:26:33.283
Sigmund Reich: [In Yiddish] A quarantine camp.

00:26:33.283 --> 00:26:34.549
David Boder: What kind of a camp?

00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:35.408
Sigmund Reich: Quarantine.

00:26:35.408 --> 00:26:35.701
David Boder: A quarantine camp.

00:26:35.701 --> 00:26:36.764
Sigmund Reich: Three weeks...

00:26:36.764 --> 00:26:36.954
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:26:36.954 --> 00:26:41.022
Sigmund Reich: Yes. We had to stay there three weeks. But, in this lager it was very bad.

00:26:41.022 --> 00:26:41.538
David Boder: Bad?

00:26:41.538 --> 00:26:42.194
Sigmund Reich: Very bad.

00:26:42.194 --> 00:26:42.787
David Boder: Why?

00:26:42.787 --> 00:26:44.877
Sigmund Reich: First, the food was no good.

00:26:44.877 --> 00:26:45.471
David Boder: Yes.

00:26:45.471 --> 00:26:47.533
Sigmund Reich: There was very little food.

00:26:47.533 --> 00:26:48.267
David Boder: [In German] What?

00:26:48.267 --> 00:26:49.798
Sigmund Reich: [In Yiddish] There was very little food.

00:26:49.798 --> 00:26:50.329
David Boder: Yes.

00:26:50.329 --> 00:26:53.455
Sigmund Reich: They cooked only potatoes.

00:26:53.455 --> 00:26:53.743
David Boder: Yes?

00:26:53.743 --> 00:27:03.922
Sigmund Reich: Nothing else. Meat we did not receive altogether, so we only ate...we only ate potatoes and the fifth of bread that we received.

00:27:03.922 --> 00:27:05.567
David Boder: That was in the Swiss quarantine?

00:27:05.567 --> 00:27:06.124
Sigmund Reich: Yes.

00:27:06.124 --> 00:27:06.452
David Boder: Nu?

00:27:06.452 --> 00:27:08.200
Sigmund Reich: And there...

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.309
David Boder: How many people were there?

00:27:09.309 --> 00:27:11.981
Sigmund Reich: There were about a hundred people.

00:27:11.981 --> 00:27:12.436
David Boder: Yes.

00:27:12.436 --> 00:27:17.654
Sigmund Reich: There were also...but all were from concentration camps. They were from other ones.

00:27:17.654 --> 00:27:18.091
David Boder: Hm.

00:27:18.091 --> 00:27:25.171
Sigmund Reich: And we were...we were there three weeks. After the three weeks we came to Waedenswil, and...

00:27:25.171 --> 00:27:25.652
David Boder: Where?

00:27:25.652 --> 00:27:26.611
Sigmund Reich: To Waedenswil.

00:27:26.611 --> 00:27:27.356
David Boder: Waedenswil?

00:27:27.356 --> 00:27:27.918
Sigmund Reich: Waedenswil.

00:27:27.918 --> 00:27:28.324
David Boder: Yes?

00:27:28.324 --> 00:27:42.578
Sigmund Reich: There we were also some...something like two weeks. There came a woman doctor, Emma [?] from Switzerland and took us out, because we wanted to go to a religious lager, there where one eats kosher.

00:27:42.578 --> 00:27:43.351
David Boder: Yes.

00:27:43.351 --> 00:27:50.685
Sigmund Reich: And so, we were taken out and we were sent to Attenberg [?]. In Attenberg [?] it was...it was very good.

00:27:50.685 --> 00:27:51.497
David Boder: It was not very good?

00:27:51.497 --> 00:27:53.069
Sigmund Reich: Yes. It was very good there.

00:27:53.069 --> 00:27:55.623
David Boder: Was this in a Jewish, a kosher lager?

00:27:55.623 --> 00:27:55.997
Sigmund Reich: Yes.

00:27:55.997 --> 00:27:56.686
David Boder: Nu?

00:27:56.686 --> 00:28:06.359
Sigmund Reich: And we studied there a little, and we worked a little. Something like every six weeks we went on...on leave, three, four days.

00:28:06.359 --> 00:28:08.342
David Boder: Where did you go on leave?

00:28:08.342 --> 00:28:18.779
Sigmund Reich: And...I...When we went to Waedenswil, we were sent to Zurich on the first Saturday, so we went there. I was assigned there to a woman, and I went there often.

00:28:18.779 --> 00:28:19.717
David Boder: To a family?

00:28:19.717 --> 00:28:20.702
Sigmund Reich: Yes. To a family.

00:28:20.702 --> 00:28:21.187
David Boder: Nu?

00:28:21.187 --> 00:28:23.847
Sigmund Reich: And I went there to the family every six weeks.

00:28:23.847 --> 00:28:24.597
David Boder: Yes?

00:28:24.597 --> 00:28:41.476
Sigmund Reich: And later was established in Morcote [?] a...also a home for those...those boys who are from concentration camps. And we went there. We were there three months. We were in Tessin, near Lugano. A very nice...

00:28:41.476 --> 00:28:42.320
David Boder: Hm.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:55.960
Sigmund Reich: It is a very nice region. It is very hot there in a very warm climate. And we did not work there very much. I...I worked at house service. I only cleaned the house.

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:56.632
David Boder: The what?

00:28:56.632 --> 00:28:57.913
Sigmund Reich: House. The house.

00:28:57.913 --> 00:28:59.841
David Boder: In the house?

00:28:59.841 --> 00:29:00.902
Sigmund Reich: In the house. The house...

00:29:00.902 --> 00:29:01.756
David Boder: Yes.

00:29:01.756 --> 00:29:06.695
Sigmund Reich: Cleaned. And we studied there. Half a day we studied a little.

00:29:06.695 --> 00:29:08.349
David Boder: What did one study, Hebrew?

00:29:08.349 --> 00:29:12.740
Sigmund Reich: Heb-...not Hebrew, but the Pentateuch, Rashe, the Talmud.

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.721
David Boder: [In English] Oh yes, I mean a...

00:29:14.721 --> 00:29:15.252
Sigmund Reich: [In Yiddish] Yes.

00:29:15.252 --> 00:29:19.674
David Boder: . . . Jewish [education]. Nu. Was there a rebbe? [This word has two distinct meanings: (1) a teacher; (2) a rabbi. The interviewer meant teacher. The boy apparently did not understand him and used the word in the second connotation.]

00:29:19.674 --> 00:29:23.401
Sigmund Reich: No. There was no rabbi. Only in...in Attenberg [?] was there a Rabbi.

00:29:23.401 --> 00:29:23.736
David Boder: Nu.

00:29:23.736 --> 00:29:25.847
Sigmund Reich: Reb Yoine [?].

00:29:25.847 --> 00:29:26.000
David Boder: Yes.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:26.903
Sigmund Reich: He is now in Zurich.

00:29:26.903 --> 00:29:27.626
David Boder: Yes.

00:29:27.626 --> 00:29:34.543
Sigmund Reich: In Morcote [?] we were there something like three, four months, and later we arrived in Genf [Geneva]. To...to the ORT school.

00:29:34.543 --> 00:29:35.641
David Boder: To the ORT school?

00:29:35.641 --> 00:29:35.876
Sigmund Reich: Yes.

00:29:35.876 --> 00:29:37.048
David Boder: And where do you live now?

00:29:37.048 --> 00:29:39.173
Sigmund Reich: Now we live on the Avenue de Champelle [?].

00:29:39.173 --> 00:29:41.410
David Boder: This is a home for the youth? And...

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:43.826
Sigmund Reich: It is private. It is not a home. It is private. We...

00:29:43.826 --> 00:29:44.955
David Boder: How many are you there?

00:29:44.955 --> 00:29:47.799
Sigmund Reich: We are there something like twenty persons.

00:29:47.799 --> 00:29:48.986
David Boder: And where do you eat.

00:29:48.986 --> 00:29:49.674
Sigmund Reich: We eat there.

00:29:49.674 --> 00:29:52.768
David Boder: Hm. Tell me, what are you studying?

00:29:52.768 --> 00:29:57.137
Sigmund Reich: We are studying there...two, three times a week we are studying the Pentateuch, Rashe.

00:29:57.137 --> 00:29:57.497
David Boder: Yes?

00:29:57.497 --> 00:30:00.701
Sigmund Reich: We study...we study there Hebrew. We study...we study...

00:30:00.701 --> 00:30:02.992
David Boder: Tell me, what are you studying here?

00:30:02.992 --> 00:30:06.445
Sigmund Reich: Here...here I study for a...a mechanical...a mechanical trade.

00:30:06.445 --> 00:30:10.196
David Boder: And how long will it take to learn it?

00:30:10.196 --> 00:30:12.191
Sigmund Reich: However long it will take, it will take.

00:30:12.191 --> 00:30:14.288
David Boder: Yes. And then what do you want to do?

00:30:14.288 --> 00:30:17.428
Sigmund Reich: And then? Then I hope I’ll be able to go to Eretz.

00:30:17.428 --> 00:30:18.131
David Boder: [In English] Where?

00:30:18.131 --> 00:30:18.865
Sigmund Reich: [In Yiddish] To Eretz.

00:30:18.865 --> 00:30:19.584
David Boder: [In English] Where is that?

00:30:19.584 --> 00:30:20.021
Sigmund Reich: [In Yiddish] Eretz Yisroeil.

00:30:20.021 --> 00:30:21.974
David Boder: [In German] You want to go to Palestine.

00:30:21.974 --> 00:30:22.443
Sigmund Reich: [In Yiddish] Yes.

00:30:22.443 --> 00:30:26.179
David Boder: And where do you have any relatives in Eretz Yisroeil?

00:30:26.179 --> 00:30:27.772
Sigmund Reich: In Eretz Yisroeil I have no relatives.

00:30:27.772 --> 00:30:29.473
David Boder: Do you have any relatives in America?

00:30:29.473 --> 00:30:39.344
Sigmund Reich: I know my uncle has some cousins there, but quite distant. She is quite distant from me. I...I don’t write to her and she does not write...

00:30:39.344 --> 00:30:39.410
David Boder: So then you have nobody?

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:39.910
Sigmund Reich: No.

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:40.754
David Boder: Hm.

00:30:40.754 --> 00:30:44.175
Sigmund Reich: Only the uncle who...whom I have in Belgium.

00:30:44.175 --> 00:30:46.535
David Boder: In Belgium. Do you correspond with him.

00:30:46.535 --> 00:30:51.850
Sigmund Reich: Yes. He is now here...here in Switzerland because he was also three years, together with me, in a concentration camp.

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:54.691
David Boder: He was in [a] concentration camp. So what is he doing now in Switzerland?

00:30:54.691 --> 00:30:57.152
Sigmund Reich: So now he came to Switzerland to recuperate. He is sick with his lungs.

00:30:57.152 --> 00:30:57.746
David Boder: Oh.

00:30:57.746 --> 00:31:03.737
Sigmund Reich: And now he is getting much better than before.

00:31:03.737 --> 00:31:10.089
David Boder: Hm. Now, please tell us which times were the worst that you had in the concentration camp.

00:31:10.089 --> 00:31:12.308
Sigmund Reich: In Kamenz I had it the worst.

00:31:12.308 --> 00:31:13.433
David Boder: Yes?

00:31:13.433 --> 00:31:42.897
Sigmund Reich: There we were...also quite a few months. There the food was very bad. The treatment also was very bad. The...generally, even...even also the people who were in concentration camps, the prisoners themselves, the goyim, [gentiles], were very mean. They could not look at a Jew. And besides that, the guards were all Hungarians. The Hungarian guards were very...were very mean.

00:31:42.897 --> 00:31:44.360
David Boder: [In German] Were they Hungarian SS?

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.001
Sigmund Reich: SS.

00:31:45.001 --> 00:31:45.626
David Boder: Yes?

00:31:45.626 --> 00:32:13.464
Sigmund Reich: [In Yiddish] They reported voluntarily as...eh...[as] ‘Germans’...to the German army. And they guarded us. Every time in the morning we left at the break of dawn. We were...we got up, and we were marched to work, and when it got a little dark we were marched back. [Interruption in the room.] Shall I repeat [?]?

00:32:13.464 --> 00:32:15.620
David Boder: [In English] In Kamenz.

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:35.807
Sigmund Reich: [In Yiddish] There the guards were Hungarians, and they treated us very badly. And...and they beat us with the rifles. They beat everybody. And every Sunday...came every Sunday, we performed gymnastics in the morning.

00:32:35.807 --> 00:32:36.713
David Boder: What is that?

00:32:36.713 --> 00:33:16.461
Sigmund Reich: This...that means we were ordered to kneel. [This was known as punitive sports.] The people who had no strength, we, thanked God that Sunday comes so we can rest. We were chased out every morning [Sunday?] to perform gymnastics. And if one did not do it well, he was...he was...he was...he was beaten for it. And so at the beginning we received there a bread for four people. The bread...the bread weighed something like a kilo, a kilo twenty. Something like that. And towards the end, when it became very bad, we were given such a bread for eight men. Later even for...for ten men.

00:33:16.461 --> 00:33:18.914
David Boder: How was it divided?

00:33:18.914 --> 00:33:21.106
Sigmund Reich: We were given a whole loaf.

00:33:21.106 --> 00:33:21.551
David Boder: Hm.

00:33:21.551 --> 00:33:23.867
Sigmund Reich: And we were told to divide it.

00:33:23.867 --> 00:33:25.741
David Boder: What kind of tattoo do you have here?

00:33:25.741 --> 00:33:29.538
Sigmund Reich: This...the...this was made in Poland. In...

00:33:29.538 --> 00:33:30.181
David Boder: Who did it?

00:33:30.181 --> 00:33:42.271
Sigmund Reich: In Mielec. The German SS made it. Everybody...Before...before, Mielec...before, Mielec was a ‘civil lager,’ but later it was changed into a KZ. Then everybody was given a KL tattooed on the head.

00:33:42.271 --> 00:33:44.318
David Boder: What is...what dies it mean, KL?

00:33:44.318 --> 00:33:46.396
Sigmund Reich: KL means ‘Konzentrations Lager.’

00:33:46.396 --> 00:33:49.584
David Boder: Oh! KL. And...and the Germans did it to you?

00:33:49.584 --> 00:33:50.334
Sigmund Reich: Yes. The Germans.

00:33:50.334 --> 00:33:49.008
David Boder: They did not...[abrupt end of the spool].
