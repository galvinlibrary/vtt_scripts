Janis B.: . . . to study botany, but on arrival of the Bolsheviks, [I left?] my studies and now I am continuing here.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.326
David Boder: How many years ago was this?

00:02:10.326 --> 00:02:13.357
Janis B.: It was in 1940 [unintelligible].

00:02:13.357 --> 00:02:16.154

00:02:16.154 --> 00:02:16.685
Janis B.: Yes.

00:02:16.685 --> 00:02:23.888
David Boder: And what were you doing before the university? Were you [not from?] a gymnasium or [unintelligible and weak] gymnasium?

00:02:23.888 --> 00:02:25.341
Janis B.: I was working as a [digger?].

00:02:25.341 --> 00:02:28.044
David Boder: So. And, and in the city of Riga?

00:02:28.044 --> 00:02:28.982
Janis B.: In the city of Riga.

00:02:28.982 --> 00:03:04.232
David Boder: So, you, as you told me earlier, worked [unintelligible] before you [went?] to the university. Well, okay, now start and tell me in details, because it is also important in order to finish all the history. Do you understand? But that what you have told me, I would like you to tell me [regarding everything?] in detail. I am interested in your personal history, [not?] the history of [Riga?]. Do you understand? Not the history of the [Bolsheviks?]. But I am interested in your personal history. [Translator’s note: “history” also translates as “story.”] Ag, when did the Soviets arrive in Riga?

00:03:04.232 --> 00:03:09.701
Janis B.: The Soviets arrived in Riga in July 1939.

00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:11.857

00:03:13.607 --> 00:03:14.825
David Boder: You were at the university?

00:03:14.825 --> 00:03:15.434
Janis B.: Yes.

00:03:15.434 --> 00:03:19.293
David Boder: Well, tell me what happened to you and what happened [at the university?].

00:03:19.293 --> 00:03:31.387
Janis B.: It was like this, upon the arrival of the Bolsheviks, and part of the students were supposed to [keep watch?].

00:03:31.387 --> 00:03:32.309
David Boder: Of the lessons.

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:46.981
Janis B.: . . . of the lessons, because everyone who was considered to be nationalists began [to wash out?] the investigations from the [Bolsheviks?].

00:03:46.981 --> 00:03:50.513
David Boder: So. And what [happened?] to you?

00:03:50.513 --> 00:04:16.325
Janis B.: Since my father had property [with a house?] in Riga, ah, I was considered a capitalist, another kind of capitalist, and therefore, they already looked at me as a person who [unintelligible] the enemy [after the Fascist?] regi—...regime.

00:04:16.325 --> 00:04:20.106
David Boder: Well...Then what happened to you?

00:04:20.106 --> 00:04:37.793
Janis B.: Our house was nationalized and...and [passage itself?] [stumbles], at the same time I was at [unintelligible], I also was working at the same time, ah, at a private, ah...

00:04:37.793 --> 00:04:44.371
David Boder: At a private [business?], ah, in a private, ah, office.

00:04:44.371 --> 00:05:13.673
Janis B.: In an office. We [unintelligible] there, again [our own?]. [Unintelligible] and since I [it made the chief?] organization, that [here?] I was considered suspicious and after this [definition?] I also was [convinced?] to be [unintelligible] being contemplated to be exiled to Siberia.

00:05:13.673 --> 00:05:15.985
David Boder: Well, what did you do then?

00:05:15.985 --> 00:05:40.781
Janis B.: I, since there [already?] was the frame of mind...well, we began, ah, [among?] acquaintances already, some part was, ah, some parts of the acquaintances were [incorrect grammar] already...

00:05:40.781 --> 00:05:42.749
David Boder: Arrested.

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:54.222
Janis B.: . . . arrested, who were not able to be involved at the university, because already...[audio becomes very weak]

00:05:54.222 --> 00:05:57.206
David Boder: [Well, yes?]. [Unintelligible]. Because what?

00:05:57.206 --> 00:06:00.690
Janis B.: Because [interrupted by Boder] already—

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.896
David Boder: [Unintelligible] [police?] if [everything?] falls out [weak and unintelligible, speaking over each other]

00:06:02.896 --> 00:06:03.615
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:03.615 --> 00:06:10.909
Janis B.: Again it [unintelligible] [would try to load there from?] [Turshchina?].

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:13.206
David Boder: Well, go on. [Unintelligible]. Afterwards [better now?]

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:15.206
Janis B.: [Unintelligible].

00:06:15.206 --> 00:06:29.190
David Boder: [Stop?]. Well, what you consider important, what you have personally. What happened then personally to you?

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:46.533
Janis B.: So. My father’s house had been nationalized [unintelligible] residents to stay [unintelligible] in their [unintelligible] apartment and the whole family move to another smaller apartment.

00:06:46.533 --> 00:06:50.939
David Boder: [And tell me?]. The house was nationalized. Who took it? And who [moved?] there?

00:06:50.939 --> 00:07:05.095
Janis B.: Ag, no one arrived, but it was [open?] and we were not able to [an apartment?]...oh...

00:07:05.095 --> 00:07:09.204
David Boder: [unintelligible] did you take?

00:07:09.204 --> 00:07:13.360
Janis B.: One part [unintelligible] was left.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.415
David Boder: So, and the apartment payments you also were not able to take.

00:07:15.415 --> 00:07:16.259
Janis B.: No.

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:18.009
David Boder: And were other people left there to live?

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:19.384
Janis B.: Others [already?] had remained.

00:07:19.384 --> 00:07:22.008
David Boder: [Unintelligible] they live?

00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:22.695
Janis B.: [Unintelligible].

00:07:22.695 --> 00:07:27.711
David Boder: So. And you [forced yourself?] and they paid for the apartment, but how [unintelligible] taken the money?

00:07:27.711 --> 00:07:29.492
Janis B.: Well, for the apartment myself, ag— [interrupted by Boder]

00:07:29.492 --> 00:07:30.133
David Boder: [Unintelligible].

00:07:30.133 --> 00:07:31.539
Janis B.: [Unintelligible].

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:38.117
David Boder: So...And where did you yourself then, what did he do with you? Are you a married man?

00:07:38.117 --> 00:07:40.492
Janis B.: No, I am not married.

00:07:40.492 --> 00:07:44.023
David Boder: So. Well, so. Then what happened to you?

00:07:44.023 --> 00:07:53.726
Janis B.: I continued...

00:07:53.726 --> 00:07:57.242
David Boder: What did you propose to do? To work?

00:07:57.242 --> 00:07:58.929
Janis B.: Ag, I continued working.

00:07:58.929 --> 00:07:59.507
David Boder: Printing—

00:07:59.507 --> 00:08:16.713
Janis B.: [interrupts]...the printing business, because I worked there as a bookkeeper and the director [also?] was sent from the Communists, but he [unintelligible] only twenty-two, ah twenty-two years, ah...

00:08:16.713 --> 00:08:17.900
David Boder: He was only twenty-two—

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:41.180
Janis B.: [interrupts] Only twenty-two years old. He didn’t know a thing about bookkeeping or about the printing business, but since he was supposed [to find room?] for some time in, ah, the old [unintelligible]. But gradually [those?] who he was unable for [any?] of the others [months?] everyone was released.

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:46.008
David Boder: And were many Latvians Communists? [Didn’t anyone say?] that they were Communists?

00:08:46.008 --> 00:09:17.429
Janis B.: It is difficult to say, because at all the meetings where and if someone forgot [to deviate?] from them, then the meeting chairman always [hid?], there is someone against the [wise one?] because [there will be?] the understanding and no one was able to say that he was against it. So, that [all these?] people were being accepted [it was acceptable in part perhaps seventy-eight there, almost?] ninety percent would be against it.

00:09:17.429 --> 00:09:23.397
David Boder: Well, and what about you, did you work there until the Germans arrived?

00:09:23.397 --> 00:09:36.114
Janis B.: Yes, until then. Ag, because, ag, the large, ag, massive exodus to Siberia began only on 14 June, but...

00:09:36.114 --> 00:09:37.051
David Boder: Of what year?

00:09:37.051 --> 00:09:39.348
Janis B.: 1940.

00:09:39.348 --> 00:09:40.723
David Boder: And the Germans arrived when?

00:09:40.723 --> 00:09:44.942
Janis B.: July 1, 1940.

00:09:44.942 --> 00:09:49.676
David Boder: So that they had time [unintelligible] only two weeks?

00:09:49.676 --> 00:10:01.113
Janis B.: Two weeks. And on the 22nd of June the war started, so that ag, this ex...exodus was stopped.

00:10:01.113 --> 00:10:05.691
David Boder: The war. Ag, they began [to send?] on July 14.

00:10:05.691 --> 00:10:06.425
Janis B.: Hmm.

00:10:06.425 --> 00:10:07.909
David Boder: The war started on the 22nd.

00:10:07.909 --> 00:10:08.315
Janis B.: The war.

00:10:08.315 --> 00:10:11.096
David Boder: This means, [all?] they sent [unintelligible] eight days.

00:10:11.096 --> 00:10:12.158
Janis B.: Yes. [Unintelligible]

00:10:12.158 --> 00:10:14.048
David Boder: [How many do you think?] they [sent?]?

00:10:14.048 --> 00:10:19.376
Janis B.: Presumably...ah, presumably sixty thousand.

00:10:19.376 --> 00:10:23.610
David Boder: So...[Over?] sixty thousand people were [unintelligible].

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:24.844
Janis B.: [unintelligible]

00:10:24.844 --> 00:10:27.063
David Boder: Do you know what happened with them?

00:10:27.063 --> 00:10:43.953
Janis B.: I don’t know because almost no one came back, because afterwards after this the Germans arrived and the front was now...

00:10:43.953 --> 00:10:45.265
David Boder: [Unintelligible]

00:10:45.265 --> 00:10:45.638
Janis B.: [Same words, also unintelligible]

00:10:45.638 --> 00:10:48.237
David Boder: Well, okay. Just where were you yourself? What [was the example?] not to send you?

00:10:48.237 --> 00:11:10.357
Janis B.: Everyone [unintelligible] time...there [such?] [unintelligible] ah, it was explained [let’s say?] of the foundation was a so-called personnel [department?] and there were, there were [unintelligible] lists from, ah...from, ag, from those [unintelligible] who considered [them] suspicious. But, [unintelligible] were not, [only for years?] themselves ah...

00:11:10.357 --> 00:11:10.357
David Boder: Suspicious.

00:11:10.357 --> 00:11:42.678
Janis B.: . . . suspicious. So [my?] [unintelligible] [was a customs man?] made hats after this [unintelligible] [about two months?] in a kitchen. Well, since the war had started, then thanks to it they did not succeed [to achieve?] everything.

00:11:42.678 --> 00:11:53.936
David Boder: Well, okay. Well then [for the Germans?]. What happened with all those who were your chiefs [weak]?

00:11:53.936 --> 00:12:05.210
Janis B.: [Large?]. Ag, all the chiefs who had been repressed in Bolshevist times ah, they all left with the Bolsheviks.

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:12.482
David Boder: Were they Estonians, too?...[unintelligible] were they also Es— [stops]. Where, ag, I’m sorry, were they also Latvians?

00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:26.449
Janis B.: No. Ah, ah, ah, the director was not a Latvian, the director was a Russian, and the chief bookkeeper, too [unintelligible] Russian...who left together with the Communists out of Rus—...[corrects himself] from Russia.

00:12:26.449 --> 00:12:28.365
David Boder: And what language were the books in?

00:12:28.365 --> 00:12:31.323
Janis B.: The books [unintelligible] again in Latvian.

00:12:31.323 --> 00:12:39.467
David Boder: Well, yes. This means, the Germans arrived and what happened to your printing house? What was it, a state printing house?

00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:40.464
Janis B.: A state—

00:12:40.464 --> 00:12:41.149
David Boder: [interrupts] What did they print there?

00:12:41.149 --> 00:12:49.387
Janis B.: They printed [all?] the money, stocks and also books there.

00:12:49.387 --> 00:12:51.271
David Boder: Well, yes.

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:59.717
Janis B.: I am not, not [confirming?] our print from that [unintelligible] [students?].

00:12:59.717 --> 00:13:02.027
David Boder: [It was not confirmed from that?]?

00:13:02.027 --> 00:13:03.525
Janis B.: From the arrival of the Germans. [I/It remained?] until— [stops]

00:13:03.525 --> 00:13:04.789
David Boder: Well, yes.

00:13:04.789 --> 00:13:08.957
Janis B.: Right now it was not [whole?], it was not destroyed.

00:13:08.957 --> 00:13:10.986
David Boder: Go on.

00:13:10.986 --> 00:13:44.073
Janis B.: So, that work had been able to continue. Ag, the money was no longer great, they didn’t print more because then a new currency was [introduced?] again, German, they sent all, ah, the German money from Germany, but [printing?] continued [unintelligible] to print books and various necessary papers.

00:13:44.073 --> 00:13:52.859
David Boder: Well, and tell me what...it...and did they print money there during the Soviets [occupation]?

00:13:52.859 --> 00:13:56.261
Janis B.: They [also?] printed money during the Soviets.

00:13:56.261 --> 00:13:57.760
David Boder: Latvian? [unintelligible].

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:02.883
Janis B.: No, not Latvian, [it means everything was?] rubles were introduced everywhere.

00:14:02.883 --> 00:14:11.099
David Boder: Well...So the Germans arrived. What happened to you and your family then? Did they give the house back to you?

00:14:11.099 --> 00:14:18.924
Janis B.: No, not right away. They only said that [after this?] we would get it back.

00:14:18.924 --> 00:14:23.594
David Boder: Did you get it then? [sound totally disappears for a few seconds]

00:14:23.594 --> 00:14:40.149
Janis B.: It was necessary to take different evidence there that this house had belonged to us earlier, but since, ag, but we did not receive an official paper that this house belongs to us again.

00:14:40.149 --> 00:14:43.336
David Boder: And the apartment money, did you begin to receive apartment money?

00:14:43.336 --> 00:14:51.051
Janis B.: We began to receive apartment money, but they were supposed to have been [a regular fund?] and were able only one part [a month?].

00:14:51.051 --> 00:15:00.219
David Boder: And the remaining [unintelligible]. Well, go on. What did you do then? Did you continue to be a bookkeeper?

00:15:00.219 --> 00:15:02.343
Janis B.: I continued to be a bookkeeper.

00:15:02.343 --> 00:15:02.343
David Boder: And...how did the Germans relate to your then later? [He forgot about?] [unintelligible] so?

00:15:02.343 --> 00:15:09.809
Janis B.: Yes.

00:15:09.809 --> 00:15:10.309
David Boder: Well, how did they relate to you, ah, to the population?

00:15:10.309 --> 00:15:13.949
Janis B.: Well, when the Germans arrived at first, everyone was very happy, because they thought it would be a lot better. But, [after?] it turned out that it was especially good with the Germans, because as we know, the Germans [liquidated some other?] peoples [unintelligible] [self?].

00:15:13.949 --> 00:15:40.097
David Boder: Well, and...

00:15:40.097 --> 00:15:41.640
Janis B.: But, but...

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:46.498
David Boder: Did they start to arrest someone?

00:15:46.498 --> 00:16:01.647
Janis B.: They arrested in several places those who had been avoiding, ah, ah...about whom they thought that they were working with the Bolsheviks.

00:16:01.647 --> 00:16:03.334
David Boder: [Did they start?] to arrest many people?

00:16:03.334 --> 00:16:06.990
Janis B.: Not from our establishment—

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:09.161
David Boder: [interrupts] No, I am thinking [about Jews?].

00:16:09.161 --> 00:16:10.708
Janis B.: Quite [unintelligible].

00:16:10.708 --> 00:16:13.036
David Boder: And well, in particular? Latvians?

00:16:13.036 --> 00:16:22.364
Janis B.: Latvians too [unintelligible] Russians and Jews.

00:16:22.364 --> 00:16:26.442
David Boder: So. Well, and what did they do with the Jews?

00:16:26.442 --> 00:16:40.239
Janis B.: With the Jews they...they [sent?] to live in a separate quarter—

00:16:40.239 --> 00:16:41.942
David Boder: [interrupting each other] to a ghetto [weak], right?

00:16:41.942 --> 00:16:42.270
Janis B.: Yes, [to a ghetto?].

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:47.583
