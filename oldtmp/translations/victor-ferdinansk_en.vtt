00:00:00.625 --> 00:00:12.663
David Boder: [In English] Munich, September the 24th, 1946, at the UNRRA University of the Deutsches Museum. The interviewee is Mr. Victor Ferdinansk, a Lithuanian, who will talk to us in German.

00:00:12.663 --> 00:00:20.122
David Boder: [In German:] Now tell me, Victor, what happened to you when the Russians had come to Lithuania?

00:00:20.122 --> 00:00:34.662
Victor Ferdinansk: [He speaks rather fluently, but it is the German of a foreigner.] And so the Russians came to Lithuania. They came in 1940. At that time I was a gymnasium pupil of third grade [possibly counting from the top], and in the autumn of that year I came to Tallinn and entered the eighth year of the Ritter Seminary [Seminary of the Knights; origin of the name is not clear, but possibly named after the Crusaders].

00:00:34.662 --> 00:00:36.740
David Boder: What is your religion?

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.302
Victor Ferdinansk: I am a Roman Catholic.

00:00:38.302 --> 00:00:39.958
David Boder: Yes.

00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:46.696
Victor Ferdinansk: And it was clear to all of us that the Ritter Seminary will not continue to exist for long.

00:00:46.696 --> 00:00:48.868
David Boder: In what city was that seminary?

00:00:48.868 --> 00:00:50.227
Victor Ferdinansk: In Tallinn...[correction] in Kovno.

00:00:50.227 --> 00:00:55.241
David Boder: In Kovno? A so-called [in Russian] theological seminary.

00:00:55.241 --> 00:00:56.585
Victor Ferdinansk: A theological seminary.

00:00:56.585 --> 00:00:58.335
David Boder: Near Riga? Well...

00:00:58.335 --> 00:01:30.034
Victor Ferdinansk: And as a member of the Franciscan Order, I was sent by my superiors to Germany with instructions to go to Italy, since at that time a number of our compatriots studied in Italy, and they had already obtained for us the [proper] documents.

00:01:30.034 --> 00:01:32.871
David Boder: Now what does that mean, “the documents”? What kind of documents did you need?

00:01:32.871 --> 00:01:35.465
Victor Ferdinansk: That means entrance documents [permits] to Italy.

00:01:35.465 --> 00:01:36.309
David Boder: Yes.

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:41.958
Victor Ferdinansk: But we were deeply disappointed when we came to Germany.

00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:42.646
David Boder: Yes.

00:01:42.646 --> 00:01:56.370
Victor Ferdinansk: I had the intention to get to Italy, but instead of that something different happened. At the illegal crossing of the border I was...

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.528
David Boder: Oh, you had crossed the border to Germany illegally?

00:01:58.528 --> 00:02:24.154
Victor Ferdinansk: Yes. I was arrested and placed in a lager where I spent seven days. But then it was established [?] that I was not a spy. So then supplied with a pass, I was sent to Berlin where I had to render services as a prisoner [?] together with French prisoners who were in Germany.

00:02:24.154 --> 00:02:26.903
David Boder: Oh, so you did not get a traveler’s permit to Italy?

00:02:26.903 --> 00:02:27.965
Victor Ferdinansk: No.

00:02:27.965 --> 00:02:31.558
David Boder: You were simply taken prisoner?

00:02:31.558 --> 00:02:34.714
Victor Ferdinansk: I was arrested and taken to work.

00:02:34.714 --> 00:02:36.229
David Boder: Now go on.

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:40.979
Victor Ferdinansk: After I had worked approximately three or four months...

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:42.932
David Boder: Did you live in a lager?

00:02:42.932 --> 00:02:47.072
Victor Ferdinansk: That was a work lager.

00:02:47.072 --> 00:02:47.666
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:55.765
Victor Ferdinansk: Very many slept in one room. I believe there were fifty people, at least.

00:02:55.765 --> 00:02:56.734
David Boder: Yes. Nu, and...

00:02:56.734 --> 00:03:27.522
Victor Ferdinansk: And once the whole building where we lived together was searched, and of the basis of my nationality [Lithuanian] I was again arrested by the Gestapo and taken to the police headquarters of Berlin. They questioned me at length for three hours, asked about various things, but it was established then that I was not a dangerous person, but just a student of theology...

00:03:27.522 --> 00:03:28.178
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:28.178 --> 00:03:32.073
Victor Ferdinansk: . . . and I was released after the three-hour questioning.

00:03:32.073 --> 00:03:32.948
David Boder: Nu.

00:03:32.948 --> 00:03:50.430
Victor Ferdinansk: But the whole story was very unpleasant to me, and I did not want it to have possibly any [bad] consequences. For that reason I went from Berlin to Munich.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.997
David Boder: Now how come? Ille—...

00:03:51.997 --> 00:03:53.216
Victor Ferdinansk: Illegally...

00:03:53.216 --> 00:04:02.313
David Boder: Illegally. Now tell me, could you not come to an understanding with the Catholic clergy in Germany that they should help you? With the Franciscans?

00:04:02.313 --> 00:04:12.892
Victor Ferdinansk: No. In Berlin that was hardly possible, because all the authorities were badly set against religion, and there was nothing one could do.

00:04:12.892 --> 00:04:13.720
David Boder: Now...

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.980
Victor Ferdinansk: I was then very young, and was in very poor command of the German language.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.819
David Boder: Were you permitted to go to church?

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:21.069
Victor Ferdinansk: One was permitted to go to church.

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:23.553
David Boder: Could you not talk there with the priest?

00:04:23.553 --> 00:04:45.039
Victor Ferdinansk: Practically [in fact] they could not help much. And then in order to be able to admit [to the parish] all the foreigners, they also had to have a police permit. And without such a police permit they could not admit one at all. That is why I decided to flee to Bavaria, where the whole country is Catholic.

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:46.008
David Boder: Nu.

00:04:46.008 --> 00:04:46.992
Victor Ferdinansk: And...

00:04:46.992 --> 00:04:48.648
David Boder: You came then to Munich?

00:04:48.648 --> 00:05:02.977
Victor Ferdinansk: To Munich. In 1941 in the spring I came to Munich where I was accepted by a Franciscan monastery, where I was working until 1945 as a Lithuanian and foreigner.

00:05:02.977 --> 00:05:07.633
David Boder: Ah. So afterwards the Germans knew that you were there?

00:05:07.633 --> 00:05:15.429
Victor Ferdinansk: Later on...They did not know it. But later on, when I was registered, that was...

00:05:15.429 --> 00:05:16.210
David Boder: Cleared up?

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:37.254
Victor Ferdinansk: An employee of the Gestapo arrived. The whole affair was cleared up, and he gave the following orders: I have no right to go out into the city in “civvies,” that means in civilian clothes, only in the habit of the order...

00:05:37.254 --> 00:05:37.941
David Boder: Nu.

00:05:37.941 --> 00:05:47.087
Victor Ferdinansk: . . . which [although it] then was permitted, that people of the order could go into the city in civilian clothes.

00:05:47.087 --> 00:05:47.915
David Boder: Nu.

00:05:47.915 --> 00:05:50.134
Victor Ferdinansk: Then, second, it was ordered that every week I had to present myself to the nearby police station.

00:05:50.134 --> 00:05:51.008
David Boder: Nu.

00:05:51.008 --> 00:05:51.581
Victor Ferdinansk: It was prohibited for me to speak Lithuanian on the street.

00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:52.643
David Boder: Oh, yes.

00:05:52.643 --> 00:05:57.293
Victor Ferdinansk: And [I] was also not permitted to write Lithuanian letters to others, in the Lithuanian language.

00:05:57.293 --> 00:05:59.525
David Boder: Hm. But you could write in the German language.

00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:01.869
Victor Ferdinansk: In the German language I was not [?] permitted to write.

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:04.494
David Boder: To whom could you or did you want to write?

00:06:04.494 --> 00:06:12.327
Victor Ferdinansk: Ordinarily I maintained no other correspondence with my friends, with other...

00:06:12.327 --> 00:06:14.234
David Boder: Where, here in Germany?

00:06:14.234 --> 00:06:15.077
Victor Ferdinansk: Here in Germany.

00:06:15.077 --> 00:06:15.514
David Boder: In lagers, et cetera [?]?

00:06:15.514 --> 00:06:16.139
Victor Ferdinansk: Yes.

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:21.889
David Boder: Aha. Now continue. During all that time did the Germans ever beat you?

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:27.197
Victor Ferdinansk: Thanks to the fact that I was a student, it is self-understood that I did not have the occasion to get into beatings.

00:06:27.197 --> 00:06:32.884
David Boder: Why is that so self-understood? You have told me that the Germans did not respect religion too much.

00:06:32.884 --> 00:06:34.837
Victor Ferdinansk: That is of course correct.

00:06:34.837 --> 00:06:37.665
David Boder: But...but as far as you are concerned?

00:06:37.665 --> 00:06:44.117
Victor Ferdinansk: In the monastery...in the monastery I still had a Catholic environment, and it did not come to it [to beatings].

00:06:44.117 --> 00:06:45.929
David Boder: And what were you doing in the monastery?

00:06:45.929 --> 00:06:50.710
Victor Ferdinansk: In the monastery? That is very hard to tell. We were...

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.866
David Boder: Were you treated there like all the others?

00:06:54.866 --> 00:07:03.851
Victor Ferdinansk: That cannot be said. I always felt that I was a foreigner. And they always gave us [?] to understand that we are foreigners, and we were in all...

00:07:03.851 --> 00:07:05.258
David Boder: . . . respects.

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:06.946
Victor Ferdinansk: . . . respects slighted, for that reason.

00:07:06.946 --> 00:07:10.243
David Boder: By the other people, by the other Franciscans?

00:07:10.243 --> 00:07:10.993
Victor Ferdinansk: As well, as well.

00:07:10.993 --> 00:07:11.993
David Boder: By the brothers?

00:07:11.993 --> 00:07:13.165
Victor Ferdinansk: By the brothers as well.

00:07:13.165 --> 00:07:13.634
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:13.634 --> 00:07:26.821
Victor Ferdinansk: And that is why I decided in 1945, when the Americans arrived and had established the civilian [?] camps, to enter the monastery...

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:28.353
David Boder: To leave?

00:07:28.353 --> 00:07:31.369
Victor Ferdinansk: Yes, to leave, and that is what I did.

00:07:31.369 --> 00:07:33.682
David Boder: Hm. And what do you study here now?

00:07:33.682 --> 00:07:39.056
Victor Ferdinansk: At this university I study jurisprudence, and I am now in the second semester.

00:07:39.056 --> 00:07:39.056
David Boder: Then you have given up theology?

00:07:39.056 --> 00:07:50.914
Victor Ferdinansk: I have given up theology, and only for the reason that I did not want to remain in Germany, and work among the Germans as such, as a clergyman.

00:07:50.914 --> 00:08:23.405
David Boder: Now tell me this. That you...It is very interesting to have met you. What did the Franciscan brothers think about the Nazis? I mean in general. What was the mood during the war? It is very important for us that you give us such an appraisal. I don’t ask the others about it. I just want personalia [personal experiences]. But you are a theologian. You have lived in a monastery. What was their attitude towards the war, towards the Nazis and all that?

00:08:23.405 --> 00:08:40.513
Victor Ferdinansk: This mood [attitude] varied greatly. It depended on what kind of a person one was. The older ones were, so to speak, avowed enemies of Nazism.

00:08:40.513 --> 00:08:41.153
David Boder: Yes.

00:08:41.153 --> 00:08:53.567
Victor Ferdinansk: But there also were younger ones, Germans, [among whom] we as foreigners did not count. We were left in the monastery, but the young German clergy were incorporated...

00:08:53.567 --> 00:08:54.661
David Boder: What does that mean, “incorporated”?

00:08:54.661 --> 00:08:57.056
Victor Ferdinansk: “Incorporated,” that means in the army.

00:08:57.056 --> 00:08:58.665
David Boder: Oh, they were taken?

00:08:58.665 --> 00:09:04.009
Victor Ferdinansk: Taken, and were to fight also for the Hitler cause.

00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:05.041
David Boder: Hm.

00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:22.200
Victor Ferdinansk: These of course have passed through the Hitler school, had military...had gone through military service, and as young people they were not shrewd enough to appraise the events properly.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:27.793
David Boder: Now when did you see those, after they were through with the army? How was that all?

00:09:27.793 --> 00:09:33.647
Victor Ferdinansk: Yes. We...during the war they time and again, repeatedly, were coming on furlough.

00:09:33.647 --> 00:09:34.803
David Boder: Oh, yes. Well...

00:09:34.803 --> 00:09:45.795
Victor Ferdinansk: And so one could, through brief conversations, gain an insight into their way of thinking. All of them, one might say most of them, were inspired by Hitler.

00:09:45.795 --> 00:09:46.327
David Boder: Yes.

00:09:46.327 --> 00:09:47.312
Victor Ferdinansk: The young people.

00:09:47.312 --> 00:09:47.765
David Boder: Yes.

00:09:47.765 --> 00:09:56.249
Victor Ferdinansk: But I also have met others who understood the Hitler cause differently than Hitler himself.

00:09:56.249 --> 00:09:56.687
David Boder: Nu.

00:09:56.687 --> 00:09:57.375
Victor Ferdinansk: They...

00:09:57.375 --> 00:10:02.749
David Boder: Now tell me, where was Bishop Faulhaber?Boder is referring to Michael von Faulhaber, a Roman Catholic Cardinal and Archbishop of Munich from 1917 to 1952. Faulhaber was an outspoken ideological opponent of the violent and racist policies of the Nazis. He was involved in Reichskonkordat negotiations of 1933, an agreement between the Holy See and the Nazi government that guaranteed Catholics freedom of religion in Germany. Although on the surface, this agreement appeared to sanction the activities of the Nazis, but in fact most Catholic leaders remained fundamentally opposed to Hitler’s rule.1 Where was he, in Munich?

00:10:02.749 --> 00:10:07.659
Victor Ferdinansk: Yes. At that time Bishop...[correction] Cardinal Faulhaber...

00:10:07.659 --> 00:10:08.643
David Boder: Cardinal Faulhaber.

00:10:08.643 --> 00:10:10.633
Victor Ferdinansk: . . . was in Munich. He was in Munich.

00:10:10.633 --> 00:10:13.378
David Boder: Well, he was not pro-Hitler.

00:10:13.378 --> 00:10:16.519
Victor Ferdinansk: No. Definitely no.

00:10:16.519 --> 00:10:33.878
David Boder: Well, and the others? Tell me, what did you [they?] know about the persecution of various nationalities? Say, for instance, what did you know about what was done with the Jews, with the Norwegians, with the Gypsies, and so on?

00:10:33.878 --> 00:10:51.564
Victor Ferdinansk: Yes. Well, what was done with the Jews has become clear to everybody. We all knew that the Jews were incarcerated and murdered. That all the Germans knew as well. It is self-understood that against that there was nothing to do...

00:10:51.564 --> 00:10:52.486
David Boder: Hm.

00:10:52.486 --> 00:11:03.126
Victor Ferdinansk: . . . since we, as foreigners, could feel fortunate that we [ourselves] could in some way live as humans and are not locked up.

00:11:03.126 --> 00:11:11.813
David Boder: Hm. But the Germans, the German clergy, they knew it, and what did they say about it? Did they say “it serves them right,” or...

00:11:11.813 --> 00:11:30.781
Victor Ferdinansk: The German clergy never approved of it, and at the lectures about the Old Testament, the question was often brought up concerning the Jews. So I can well remember that the Herr Professor had categorically expressed himself against the mistreatment of the Jews.

00:11:30.781 --> 00:11:33.250
David Boder: And what did the German students say?

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:50.906
Victor Ferdinansk: The German students too rejected the humiliation [degrading] of a certain nation. As theologians they did so always.

00:11:50.906 --> 00:12:00.040
David Boder: Now tell me, what was their attitude towards the war? Did they want Germany to win the war and the like?

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.899
Victor Ferdinansk: That varied a great deal.

00:12:01.899 --> 00:12:03.243
David Boder: You understand...

00:12:03.243 --> 00:12:03.852
Victor Ferdinansk: Yes.

00:12:03.852 --> 00:12:04.821
David Boder: . . . that I ask only you such a question...

00:12:04.821 --> 00:12:05.352
Victor Ferdinansk: Yes.

00:12:05.352 --> 00:12:09.417
David Boder: . . . because I think that you were a better observer than the others.

00:12:09.417 --> 00:12:10.105
Victor Ferdinansk: Yes, yes.

00:12:10.105 --> 00:12:19.239
David Boder: You were not in a lager. You were in a way free. You could talk with the Germans. The others could not. True? Now then, go on.

00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:37.019
Victor Ferdinansk: And so it varied. Most of them wanted the war to be won [by the Germans]. Then in it they saw their own chance of existence.

00:12:37.019 --> 00:12:39.991
David Boder: Oh, yes, and they were...they belonged to the country, true?

00:12:39.991 --> 00:12:40.741
Victor Ferdinansk: Yes.

00:12:40.741 --> 00:12:46.148
David Boder: And one cannot take offense against a person if he wishes that his country should win a war. You understand that?

00:12:46.148 --> 00:12:47.086
Victor Ferdinansk: Yes, I understand.

00:12:47.086 --> 00:13:00.819
David Boder: Well, they wanted to win. But how was it when the end [of the war] approached? Well? [Pause.] Were you in the monastery when the Americans arrived?

00:13:00.819 --> 00:13:02.631
Victor Ferdinansk: Yes, I was still in the monastery.

00:13:02.631 --> 00:13:04.850
David Boder: And how did things look then? Tell me.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:16.398
Victor Ferdinansk: Well, most remained calm and were very satisfied that the Hitler reign had finally come to an end.

00:13:16.398 --> 00:13:19.814
David Boder: And they knew that the Americans won’t do anything to them?

00:13:19.814 --> 00:13:34.782
Victor Ferdinansk: Yes, of course. But I have met quite a few young soldiers [German], that is former soldiers, who were greatly saddened that soldiers of other countries have entered their land.

00:13:34.782 --> 00:13:37.204
David Boder: Now, well, weren’t they themselves in other countries?

00:13:37.204 --> 00:13:49.954
Victor Ferdinansk: That certainly is correct. But as children of their fatherland, they were not especially gladdened. I at least could observe that from aside.

00:13:49.954 --> 00:14:02.360
David Boder: Now have you observed among the clergy or the Germans [in general] that they felt a certain war guilt?

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:24.872
Victor Ferdinansk: [Pause.] That I could not ascertain exactly. But I believe that if one thinks broader [deeper], that [then] every man is in some way guilty of the deeds of his fellow man...

00:14:24.872 --> 00:14:25.715
David Boder: Well...

00:14:25.715 --> 00:14:28.278
Victor Ferdinansk: . . . and in so far they too have felt guilty.

00:14:28.278 --> 00:14:39.575
David Boder: Now have you observed that there was a kind of a feeling that one has [they have] to make good for that which one has [they have] done to the world?

00:14:39.575 --> 00:14:47.543
Victor Ferdinansk: That exactly I have not noticed, that it unconditionally could be made good.

00:14:47.543 --> 00:14:50.355
David Boder: [as if correcting him] Must be made good.

00:14:50.355 --> 00:14:52.214
Victor Ferdinansk: Or must. That I did not notice.

00:14:52.214 --> 00:15:01.443
David Boder: Now tell me, for instance, this. We are now being asked in America to send clothes for the Germans. Isn’t that so? And so much is being sent.

00:15:01.443 --> 00:15:01.928
Victor Ferdinansk: Yes.

00:15:01.928 --> 00:15:07.709
David Boder: Now, did the Germans themselves give everything that they could have given?

00:15:07.709 --> 00:15:09.771
Victor Ferdinansk: For whom? For whom?

00:15:09.771 --> 00:15:15.205
David Boder: For the poor Germans, and for the other “dragged-away” [vershlepte, a standard term in Germany] people.

00:15:15.205 --> 00:15:46.615
Victor Ferdinansk: No. Because the Germans have all the time truly mistreated the dragged-away, or us foreigners. And I as a theologian have always felt that very deeply, and had to carry with pains this whole misfortune for five, six years. Because on every step, whether I was in the monastery or at any magistracy, it was always given to me to understand that I was a foreigner and have nothing to do [expect] here.

00:15:46.615 --> 00:15:54.381
David Boder: Now tell me, for instance, why do you attend now the UNRRA University and don’t go directly to a German university to study law?

00:15:54.381 --> 00:16:11.275
Victor Ferdinansk: I know the Germans very well, and it would hurt me indeed should I have to seek refuge with them as I had to. Just for this reason I don’t want [to have] anything to do with the Germans.

00:16:11.275 --> 00:16:12.916
David Boder: But you had...

00:16:12.916 --> 00:16:18.727
Victor Ferdinansk: They were my enemies all the time. Because I know them well. I had the opportunity.

00:16:18.727 --> 00:16:21.258
David Boder: [some whispers] Now where do you think then to practice law?

00:16:21.258 --> 00:16:44.995
Victor Ferdinansk: Well, that is a question to which, for the time being, I can’t give any answer. At least...I hope at least that the time will be favorable, and that we in a few years will be able to return to our homeland.

00:16:44.995 --> 00:16:56.338
David Boder: How do you imagine that? Do you think that the Russians will leave, or they will change for the better? Or...what do you think?

00:16:56.338 --> 00:17:06.199
Victor Ferdinansk: Yes, that is my personal viewpoint, that the present situation could not prevail for long.

00:17:06.199 --> 00:17:07.449
David Boder: In what sense?

00:17:07.449 --> 00:17:11.380
Victor Ferdinansk: That means all...the political situation of the whole world.

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:11.818
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:11.818 --> 00:17:17.583
Victor Ferdinansk: Because this is a transition from one state [of affairs] to another.

00:17:17.583 --> 00:17:18.474
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:18.474 --> 00:17:42.863
Victor Ferdinansk: And as such it cannot last long. That is a [unintelligible], an eternal march forward. And I believe that by peaceful or military means the possibility will be created for us to return to our homeland.

00:17:42.863 --> 00:17:50.878
David Boder: Do you have any communication with your homeland? What do you hear from your...Do you have there...you had parents there, true?

00:17:50.878 --> 00:17:53.034
Victor Ferdinansk: Yes, I had my parents in my homeland.

00:17:53.034 --> 00:17:55.924
David Boder: When did you hear from them last?

00:17:55.924 --> 00:18:14.620
Victor Ferdinansk: The communication with my parents was broken up in the year 1944, when the Russians stood [already] at the Lithuanian border...[correction] at the Estonian border, and all postal communication between Germany and Lithuania was broken.

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:15.558
David Boder: Hm.

00:18:15.558 --> 00:18:24.995
Victor Ferdinansk: Since then I heard nothing from my parents. And I fear greatly that they are not alive any more.

00:18:24.995 --> 00:18:30.479
David Boder: Is there no way of any kind to make contact, through the Red Cross, or in some other way?

00:18:30.479 --> 00:18:34.650
Victor Ferdinansk: Even if there were, I would not try it.

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:35.400
David Boder: Yes?

00:18:35.400 --> 00:19:02.542
Victor Ferdinansk: Because I am afraid to ask [tell] my parents that I am alive and live at present in Germany, because then the Russians, or the communists, will come to see in my parents something they dislike.

00:19:02.542 --> 00:19:06.192
David Boder: Now tell me, how are things here at the [UNRRA] University?

00:19:06.192 --> 00:19:30.931
Victor Ferdinansk: I am very enthusiastic about this university, and I give myself to it with my whole heart. But every start is difficult, and so the start at this university is very difficult. We also have very little money, scarce [study] facilities, also no laboratories...

00:19:30.931 --> 00:19:32.337
David Boder: How does it stand with books?

00:19:32.337 --> 00:19:35.903
Victor Ferdinansk: Too, there is no library.

00:19:35.903 --> 00:19:42.481
David Boder: Now you are a student. You study law. Do you study German law? Or what kind of law do you study?

00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:54.126
Victor Ferdinansk: As jurists and students in the third or second semester, we usually study the introductions to law, that means Roman law.

00:19:54.126 --> 00:19:55.251
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:55.251 --> 00:20:07.656
Victor Ferdinansk: Introduction to law, sociology, general economics, statistics, and with it the general subjects which are common to all nationalities and nations.

00:20:07.656 --> 00:20:59.257
David Boder: Now then, I am sorry we have to stop. I would like indeed to have every one of you for an hour or two, and probably that would have been better, but you see...I should have preferred to have two persons or three persons for three hours [each] than each one [more people] for half an hour. True? But since there are here [so many] diverse groups, I don’t want to hurt [offend] anybody. True? And maybe I would be able to make a composite from the whole story [from all the stories]. True? My name shall remain here with your director in case you want to write to me sometime. I don’t know whether I could do much, but I shall forward it [your letter] to somebody who should be able to do something. It was indeed a pleasure to get to know you. Thank you, indeed.

00:20:59.257 --> 00:21:01.688
Victor Ferdinansk: I thank you, too.
