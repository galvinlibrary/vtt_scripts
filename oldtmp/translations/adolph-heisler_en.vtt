00:00:01.593 --> 00:00:38.323
David Boder: [In English:] This is Spool 81. Geneva, August 27th, 1946. The interviewee is Abraham [?] Heisler, eighteen years old, from the Czech territory which presumably has become Russian now. He carries a tattoo number A [A is possibly just a triangle] 4470. [In German:] And so Mr. Eis-...Heisler, would you tell us again your full name and where you were born. Speak slowly and [words not clear]. Nu?

00:00:38.323 --> 00:00:41.790
Adolph Heisler: Well, my name is Adolph Heisler.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.951
David Boder: Yes.

00:00:41.951 --> 00:00:51.997
Adolph Heisler: And I come from Czechoslovakia, from Carpatho-Russia. I am eighteen years of age, and was later deported to Auschwitz.

00:00:51.997 --> 00:01:00.066
David Boder: Yes. And so, tell me, where were you and what had happened to you when the war began?

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:15.106
Adolph Heisler: When the war began we were put into a ghetto, and there we were very much mistreated. And after the ghetto...we were in the ghetto one month, and after a month we were transported away by train to Auschwitz.

00:01:15.106 --> 00:01:27.746
David Boder: Now wait a moment. I want to know the whole story. That did not go that fast. And so how did they make it known? How were you...Who were your parents? What did you father and mother do?

00:01:27.746 --> 00:01:36.353
Adolph Heisler: And so, we had a large farm and my father had a large lumber business. We were working the forests [?].

00:01:36.353 --> 00:01:37.874
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:01:37.874 --> 00:01:42.448
Adolph Heisler: And it was...and all that was then taken away from us...

00:01:42.448 --> 00:01:45.662
David Boder: Now wait. Your father was a lumber merchant, and he [also] had a farm?

00:01:45.662 --> 00:01:46.677
Adolph Heisler: Yes. and also [?]...

00:01:46.677 --> 00:01:48.230
David Boder: In the town or near the town?

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.261
Adolph Heisler: Near the town.

00:01:49.261 --> 00:01:53.848
David Boder: Near the town. Did you have any brothers and sisters?

00:01:53.848 --> 00:01:59.956
Adolph Heisler: Yes, I had two brothers. One brother is still alive today. He is in the Russian territory. He is living with an aunt.

00:01:59.956 --> 00:02:00.655
David Boder: In Russia.

00:02:00.655 --> 00:02:01.288
Adolph Heisler: Yes.

00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:02.525
David Boder: And the other one?

00:02:02.525 --> 00:02:05.928
Adolph Heisler: The other one...about the other one I know nothing, and about the parents I neither know anything.

00:02:05.928 --> 00:02:07.320
David Boder: You know nothing about your parents.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.921
Adolph Heisler: No.

00:02:07.921 --> 00:02:12.194
David Boder: No. Did you receive any letters from your brother in the Russian territory?

00:02:12.194 --> 00:02:35.301
Adolph Heisler: Not from him personally, but a girl wrote to me, a girl, an acquaintance. She was there. She was...she had lived as a neighbor next to us, so she wrote me that she had talked with my brother. I also sent once a telegram and everything, but I received no answer. I do not know...I cannot get in good communication with Russia, and I do not know how he is getting along and all that.

00:02:35.301 --> 00:02:41.504
David Boder: Yes. Nu, and so you were living there in your town. What was the name of the town?

00:02:41.504 --> 00:02:42.662
Adolph Heisler: Chynadiyovo

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:43.851
David Boder: Chynadiyovo

00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:44.168
Adolph Heisler: Yes.

00:02:44.168 --> 00:02:45.879
David Boder: How is it spelled?

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.018
Adolph Heisler: C...

00:02:47.018 --> 00:02:48.872
David Boder: Aha. C...

00:02:48.872 --> 00:02:49.049
Adolph Heisler: ...Z...

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.096
David Boder: Chyna...

00:02:50.096 --> 00:02:51.254
Adolph Heisler: Chynadiyovo.

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:52.428
David Boder: Chynadiyovo.

00:02:52.428 --> 00:02:53.870
Adolph Heisler: Yes. That is a Czech city at the [word not clear].

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:01.591
David Boder: Yes. and so, good. Now tell me. The Germans arrived. How did they enter [the city]?

00:03:01.591 --> 00:03:33.645
Adolph Heisler: Right away the army entered. We saw the German occupation with the army, and all of a sudden it became black before the Jews’ eyes. And two weeks later one morning they came, and we did not know why the houses were occupied, and they said in two hours everybody has to be packed up to be taken away. We did not know where to. The men [people] were led into a building. They were driven together into a large building, and they were taken in trucks to the ghetto.

00:03:33.645 --> 00:03:37.283
David Boder: Yes. Where...where was the ghetto? Where did they make the ghetto?

00:03:37.283 --> 00:04:01.160
Adolph Heisler: The Mukachevo Ghetto. There were large barracks of a brick factory. There were large wooden barracks where the bricks were stored, and there we were quartered. It was very crowded there. We could not stand it, because there were terribly many people. In one barrack lived three thousand persons, because there was no room. And they crowded the people terribly, and...

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.251
David Boder: Men, women, and children together?

00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:07.619
Adolph Heisler: Everything together. The families still were...the families were still together.

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:12.427
David Boder: Yes. Nu, and you were the olde-...yes, you have a brother and a [feminine ending: eine]...

00:04:12.427 --> 00:04:13.031
Adolph Heisler: Yes, the two brothers.

00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:14.125
David Boder: You had two brothers.

00:04:14.125 --> 00:04:14.521
Adolph Heisler: Yes.

00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:16.074
David Boder: Were they older or younger?

00:04:16.074 --> 00:04:17.189
Adolph Heisler: Younger brothers.

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:23.972
David Boder: Younger brothers. Now, and how long were you there, in that brick factory?

00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:26.966
Adolph Heisler: In the brick factory we were four...four weeks.

00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:30.445
David Boder: Yes? Who gave you to eat? What were you given to eat?

00:04:30.445 --> 00:04:41.612
Adolph Heisler: Yes, the Kehille [community] still supported itself. All the food supplies which we still had, had to be moved [taken along?]. We did not have much any more, because everything had been taken away.

00:04:41.612 --> 00:04:43.024
David Boder: Hm. Yes?

00:04:43.024 --> 00:04:47.442
Adolph Heisler: And what was short [insufficient] was brought from the town.

00:04:47.442 --> 00:04:51.059
David Boder: Yes. And who was the Kehille?

00:04:51.059 --> 00:05:04.956
Adolph Heisler: That was the Jewish Community [Council?] which took care that there should be sufficient. Everything was still not taken away due to money protection [bribery] and so forth. They were in [words not clear], so they permitted to bring in some food supplies.

00:05:04.956 --> 00:05:09.813
David Boder: Food supplies. Nu, and after...that lasted, you say, four weeks.

00:05:09.813 --> 00:05:10.583
Adolph Heisler: Four weeks, yes.

00:05:10.583 --> 00:05:15.001
David Boder: What happened then? Tell me all the details. How was it?

00:05:15.001 --> 00:05:41.086
Adolph Heisler: And so one morning comes, and it was said that whoever has citizen’s rights of that and that city, the citizenship, then it is possible for him to remain there...for him to be released home. And so everybody brought his papers. We, too, showed [ours], all good [valid] papers. They were taken away. And suddenly we see he makes a big fire with those papers. They were just making fun of us. And the next day...

00:05:41.086 --> 00:05:45.191
David Boder: And so you say that the papers were collected, and then what did they do?

00:05:45.191 --> 00:05:51.720
Adolph Heisler: And they were burned. They only said so [about citizenship], because they did not want us to have anything to show [identification] for the right to travel.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.237
David Boder: Yes?

00:05:52.237 --> 00:06:17.340
Adolph Heisler: And on the next day in the morning we were not permitted to leave the barracks. We saw a great number of RR-cars arriving. And they packed in many [?] people in those RR-cars, a hundred people to a wagon, without food, without anything, and we were transported...where we are being transported to nobody knew. We were riding and riding, two weeks in the train. And then we arrived in Auschwitz. We did not know...

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.126
David Boder: Yes? Nu...

00:06:18.126 --> 00:06:31.080
Adolph Heisler: We did not know about any Auschwitz, about extermina-....We saw people dressed in prisoner clothes, but we did not know what it meant. Only afterwards we found out the entire story.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:37.174
David Boder: All right. And so let us go back a little. You were put into RR-cars.

00:06:37.174 --> 00:06:37.302
Adolph Heisler: Yes.

00:06:37.302 --> 00:06:38.840
David Boder: What kind of RR-cars were they?

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.303
Adolph Heisler: They were those freight cars for cattle.

00:06:42.303 --> 00:06:42.757
David Boder: Yes?

00:06:42.757 --> 00:06:57.949
Adolph Heisler: Not passenger cars. And they were very crowded, without water. They did not supply any water. Food, there was none, because from home we had not been able any more to bring any food along. Because we had already been four weeks in that ghetto, everything had given out.

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:00.833
David Boder: How many persons were you in one wagon?

00:07:00.833 --> 00:07:02.981
Adolph Heisler: We were a hundred people in a wagon.

00:07:02.981 --> 00:07:05.001
David Boder: Were there any seats, any benches?

00:07:05.001 --> 00:07:11.063
Adolph Heisler: No, no, just so. They had taken away the bundles. They had taken away everything. We lay on the bare boards.

00:07:11.063 --> 00:07:13.289
David Boder: Was your father and mother with you?

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:15.184
Adolph Heisler: Yes, still there in the RR-car, but...

00:07:15.184 --> 00:07:16.612
David Boder: And the two brothers?

00:07:16.612 --> 00:07:22.753
Adolph Heisler: Also. All of us were still together. Only in Auschwitz, when we arrived, were we all dispersed [separated].

00:07:22.753 --> 00:07:29.708
David Boder: One moment. And so you were shoved into the RR-cars. Was there a toilet?

00:07:29.708 --> 00:07:30.838
Adolph Heisler: Nothing, nothing.

00:07:30.838 --> 00:07:36.506
David Boder: So then, how did one do it when one wanted to go to...to...to relieve oneself or...?

00:07:36.506 --> 00:07:39.278
Adolph Heisler: We had a few pots, so we...

00:07:39.278 --> 00:07:39.704
David Boder: Yes?

00:07:39.704 --> 00:07:42.995
Adolph Heisler: ...made a toilet in the pots and poured it out.

00:07:42.995 --> 00:07:44.436
David Boder: Poured it out where?

00:07:44.436 --> 00:07:45.723
Adolph Heisler: Out of the RR-car, outside [?].

00:07:45.723 --> 00:07:47.357
David Boder: Were the RR-cars open?

00:07:47.357 --> 00:07:50.290
Adolph Heisler: There was a small opening, through the window...

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:50.650
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:51.971
Adolph Heisler: ...and covered with wire.

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:52.129
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:54.256
Adolph Heisler: We could barely put the hand through.

00:07:54.256 --> 00:07:58.165
David Boder: And how did the men and women use the pots?

00:07:58.165 --> 00:08:02.180
Adolph Heisler: Well, everything was the same [did not matter]. People there did not look [care] so much any more.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:08.678
David Boder: Nu. And so, how long did the journey last?

00:08:08.678 --> 00:08:09.782
Adolph Heisler: Two weeks.

00:08:09.782 --> 00:08:10.607
David Boder: [With surprise:] Two weeks?

00:08:10.607 --> 00:08:11.122
Adolph Heisler: Yes.

00:08:11.122 --> 00:08:13.496
David Boder: Were the wagons opened every day?

00:08:13.496 --> 00:08:15.784
Adolph Heisler: No.

00:08:15.784 --> 00:08:17.249
David Boder: And water?

00:08:17.249 --> 00:08:27.308
Adolph Heisler: Neither. We had...everybody had taken along a bucket of water from the ghetto, and we had received a bread, that means two kilos of bread, and on this we lived the whole time...

00:08:27.308 --> 00:08:27.866
David Boder: And so?

00:08:27.866 --> 00:08:28.790
Adolph Heisler: ...per person [apparently still referring to the bread].

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:32.169
David Boder: Did you and your family have enough to eat?

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:35.339
Adolph Heisler: From enough it was very far, but what could one do?

00:08:35.339 --> 00:08:42.610
David Boder: Yes. Nu, did all of you.... What did the people do all day in the RR-cars?

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:56.073
Adolph Heisler: Nothing. We were sitting. One said we are being taken there, and one said this will happen. We did not know ourselves. We were completely mixed up. We were already not normal from all the ‘story’ that had happened.

00:08:56.073 --> 00:08:59.424
David Boder: Aha. Nu, and thus you arrived where? In Auschwitz?

00:08:59.424 --> 00:09:00.320
Adolph Heisler: In Auschwitz.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:06.935
David Boder: Now tell, when the train arrived, what happened then? And so what happened there?

00:09:06.935 --> 00:09:08.556
Adolph Heisler: And so we arrived there.

00:09:08.556 --> 00:09:10.944
David Boder: [Testing the microphone.] Wait a moment. Nu?

00:09:10.944 --> 00:09:37.944
Adolph Heisler: We arrived there in Auschwitz. An SS Storm leader was standing there, and he separated the older people and the children to one side, and those capable of working, those who looked very capable of working, they put to the other side. About the others, where they were led, no on knew only the next day we saw the huge flames and the smoke from the crematory where they were being burned. And we went into barracks.

00:09:37.944 --> 00:09:39.632
David Boder: Who is the we?

00:09:39.632 --> 00:09:43.332
Adolph Heisler: We the capable of working. I was also among them.

00:09:43.332 --> 00:09:47.855
David Boder: And so what happened to your family when you arrived in Auschwitz?

00:09:47.855 --> 00:09:54.805
Adolph Heisler: To my family happened that, that my brother and I stood on one side and the remaining stood...

00:09:54.805 --> 00:09:55.910
David Boder: Who were the remaining?

00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:04.855
Adolph Heisler: The mother. The father was not there, because the father had been drafted for service, for military service, still at home.

00:10:04.855 --> 00:10:05.316
David Boder: Yes?

00:10:05.316 --> 00:10:13.843
Adolph Heisler: And the mother with the smaller brother was...went...were taken away to the other side to...with those...those not capable of working.

00:10:13.843 --> 00:10:23.179
David Boder: And so, I did not know that. Your father then was not with... When, where was your father taken for military service? Was your father there with you in the ghetto?

00:10:23.179 --> 00:10:23.768
Adolph Heisler: No.

00:10:23.768 --> 00:10:27.217
David Boder: No. And so where was he? Was he in the Hungarian army?

00:10:27.217 --> 00:10:27.555
Adolph Heisler: Yes.

00:10:27.555 --> 00:10:29.330
David Boder: In the Czech army?

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:39.740
Adolph Heisler: He was in the Czech army. And then they called the strong people, those who were well capable of working [word not clear] to dig trenches.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:40.146
David Boder: Yes?

00:10:40.146 --> 00:10:43.802
Adolph Heisler: And he still remained there. And we were in the ghetto.

00:10:43.802 --> 00:10:47.056
David Boder: Aha. And you...he did not see you before you left?

00:10:47.056 --> 00:10:47.709
Adolph Heisler: No.

00:10:47.709 --> 00:10:49.191
David Boder: And you did not hear from him at all?

00:10:49.191 --> 00:10:49.803
Adolph Heisler: No.

00:10:49.803 --> 00:10:53.236
David Boder: And so your mother with the small boy went in Auschwitz to the other side?

00:10:53.236 --> 00:10:54.057
Adolph Heisler: Yes

00:10:54.057 --> 00:10:56.247
David Boder: Nu, go on.

00:10:56.247 --> 00:11:01.343
Adolph Heisler: And the brother and I, we went to bathe.

00:11:01.343 --> 00:11:01.667
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:01.667 --> 00:11:06.306
Adolph Heisler: And after we were bathed, everything was shorn off, and we were led into a barrack.

00:11:06.306 --> 00:11:08.322
David Boder: What do you mean, everything shorn off?

00:11:08.322 --> 00:11:09.692
Adolph Heisler: The hair, everything shorn off.

00:11:09.692 --> 00:11:10.490
David Boder: From the whole body?

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:11.549
Adolph Heisler: From the whole body.

00:11:11.549 --> 00:11:16.561
David Boder: [A ringing noise.] And so, go on. [In English:] There was a telephone interruption. [In german:] Nu?

00:11:16.561 --> 00:11:34.065
Adolph Heisler: And there we were...after the shearing off, in the bath, we were dressed in the prisoner uniforms just like the others. We did not know what was going on there. When we came out we already saw the sticks [clubs] flying over the backs and over the heads, those beatings there.

00:11:34.065 --> 00:11:35.837
David Boder: Who was beating you?

00:11:35.837 --> 00:11:51.714
Adolph Heisler: There were the SS, and there were the German war-...not war criminals, but professional criminals who yet in the year ’36 were put in concentration camps. They were worse yet than the SS men themselves.

00:11:51.714 --> 00:11:52.009
David Boder: Yes?

00:11:52.009 --> 00:12:04.940
Adolph Heisler: And they were appointed there as capos. That means in the lager they would be over the prisoners. So in the lager proper they had detail, and they had [were in charge of] the supervision.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.002
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:06.002 --> 00:12:22.929
Adolph Heisler: There we were driven into a barrack. And the second day we still did not get anything to eat, and sleep we could neither, because it was cold. It was on the stones, a barrack of stones. And there we...

00:12:22.929 --> 00:12:24.661
David Boder: A stone floor.

00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:28.019
Adolph Heisler: Yes. And there we sat. It was still in Birkenau proper.

00:12:28.019 --> 00:12:28.141
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:28.141 --> 00:12:32.322
Adolph Heisler: It [Birkenau] was not yet in Auschwitz. It was the quarantine lager for Auschwitz.

00:12:32.322 --> 00:12:34.052
David Boder: Yes. What kind of a lager was it?

00:12:34.052 --> 00:12:35.151
Adolph Heisler: Quarantine lager.

00:12:35.151 --> 00:12:36.109
David Boder: A quarantine lager for Auschwitz [?]?

00:12:36.109 --> 00:12:44.591
Adolph Heisler: There people were bathed, had their hair shorn off, and dressed [were outfitted]. And Auschwitz was already.... It was near Auschwitz, and Auschwitz was already the work lager.

00:12:44.591 --> 00:12:46.543
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:12:46.543 --> 00:12:54.769
Adolph Heisler: And we were then asked there [about] the occupations, what occupation one has. And they said we will be sent to work.

00:12:54.769 --> 00:12:55.507
David Boder: Yes?

00:12:55.507 --> 00:13:04.253
Adolph Heisler: And I reported as...that I was a locksmith [metal worker], because I knew that it is always better to have a trade than to work some place on a field, but...

00:13:04.253 --> 00:13:06.438
David Boder: Did you know anything about locksmithing?

00:13:06.438 --> 00:13:10.768
Adolph Heisler: Yes. I went to a school at home. I always liked to play around with these things.

00:13:10.768 --> 00:13:10.901
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:10.901 --> 00:13:20.260
Adolph Heisler: And I knew exactly that they are calling for locksmiths, then they need locksmiths, then...then one can somehow...if one has some sort of idea, when one understands [?]...

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:21.625
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:21.625 --> 00:13:29.081
Adolph Heisler: And I presented myself for it. And anyway I had no luck with it, because I was...I was not accepted for it.

00:13:29.081 --> 00:13:30.118
David Boder: Yes?

00:13:30.118 --> 00:13:38.201
Adolph Heisler: And on the next day we were called out. We had...we already had the...we had no numbers yet.

00:13:38.201 --> 00:13:38.696
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:38.696 --> 00:13:57.269
Adolph Heisler: We were just called out, and we were led to Auschwitz, to Lager
                        Auschwitz. Arriving there, we were given a soup to eat. It was already the third day, so everyone received a liter of soup, and we were led to be numbered...to tattoo the numbers.

00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:58.234
David Boder: To be tattooed.

00:13:58.234 --> 00:13:58.598
Adolph Heisler: Yes.

00:13:58.598 --> 00:14:02.506
David Boder: If everyone received a liter of soup, in what was the liter of soup given?

00:14:02.506 --> 00:14:10.420
Adolph Heisler: There were there such bowls, various broken bowls which had been collected from the transports, because they had taken along pots...

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:10.567
David Boder: Yes?

00:14:10.567 --> 00:14:11.836
Adolph Heisler: ...from the RR-cars.

00:14:11.836 --> 00:14:12.236
David Boder: Nu?

00:14:12.236 --> 00:14:16.191
Adolph Heisler: Then they collected them. And in them the soup was given...

00:14:16.191 --> 00:14:16.432
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:16.432 --> 00:14:17.139
Adolph Heisler: ...to eat.

00:14:17.139 --> 00:14:18.455
David Boder: Nu?

00:14:18.455 --> 00:14:36.409
Adolph Heisler: And after getting the liter of soup, we were tattooed. We still stayed there two days, and on the third day we were taken away. I was separated from the brother, and I was taken away to work in a coal mine. It was eight kilometers from Auschwitz, in Jawiszowice.

00:14:36.409 --> 00:14:37.283
David Boder: Jawiszowice.

00:14:37.283 --> 00:14:37.689
Adolph Heisler: Yes.

00:14:37.689 --> 00:14:38.766
David Boder: In a coal mine.

00:14:38.766 --> 00:14:39.053
Adolph Heisler: Yes.

00:14:39.053 --> 00:14:42.434
David Boder: And so, were you given hammers? Were you given...

00:14:42.434 --> 00:14:44.801
Adolph Heisler: Yes. The same as everybody, the same as every worker, I was given...

00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:46.332
David Boder: And a lamp on the head?

00:14:46.332 --> 00:14:53.631
Adolph Heisler: Not on the.... We had to carry lamps in the hands. The lamp weighed six kilo. The lamp itself was taking one’s strength.

00:14:53.631 --> 00:14:56.459
David Boder: Why? How come the lamp was that heavy? What was it?

00:14:56.459 --> 00:15:01.274
Adolph Heisler: It was...I don’t know. They were those carbide...not carbide lamps, but...

00:15:01.274 --> 00:15:01.999
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:01.999 --> 00:15:05.257
Adolph Heisler: ...such a lantern, an electric lantern [?].

00:15:05.257 --> 00:15:06.740
David Boder: Oh, they were...yes.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:06.977
Adolph Heisler: And they were...

00:15:06.977 --> 00:15:07.879
David Boder: With batteries.

00:15:07.879 --> 00:15:08.535
Adolph Heisler: Yes.

00:15:08.535 --> 00:15:08.903
David Boder: Yes?

00:15:08.903 --> 00:15:15.525
Adolph Heisler: And they were large lamps so as to last the twelve hours. We only worked eight hours...

00:15:15.525 --> 00:15:15.678
David Boder: Aha.

00:15:15.678 --> 00:15:20.097
Adolph Heisler: ...but they had to light [burn] for ten hours, to come out...

00:15:20.097 --> 00:15:20.250
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:22.369
Adolph Heisler: ...and the appells, and that and that.

00:15:22.369 --> 00:15:25.595
David Boder: And then the lamps were re-charged every night?

00:15:25.595 --> 00:15:28.919
Adolph Heisler: Yes, returned. Everybody had a lamp number, and everybody...

00:15:28.919 --> 00:15:29.046
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:29.046 --> 00:15:30.240
Adolph Heisler: ...returned the lamp.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:34.923
David Boder: Aha. Had you every worked before by coal?

00:15:34.923 --> 00:15:35.436
Adolph Heisler: No.

00:15:35.436 --> 00:15:35.568
David Boder: No.

00:15:35.568 --> 00:15:36.134
Adolph Heisler: I have...I have...

00:15:36.134 --> 00:15:37.455
David Boder: How old were you then?

00:15:37.455 --> 00:15:38.540
Adolph Heisler: Sixteen years.

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:41.734
David Boder: Aha. And with whom did you go? All the prisoners or were you...

00:15:41.734 --> 00:15:42.949
Adolph Heisler: All prisoners.

00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:45.983
David Boder: Yes? And how deep did you go down?

00:15:45.983 --> 00:15:48.451
Adolph Heisler: That was...it was four hundred and sixty meters deep.

00:15:48.451 --> 00:15:49.591
David Boder: Four [hundred] and sixty [mistake: sounds like 64] meters deep.

00:15:49.591 --> 00:15:49.817
Adolph Heisler: Yes.

00:15:49.817 --> 00:15:51.777
David Boder: You went down in what? In an elevator?

00:15:51.777 --> 00:15:52.907
Adolph Heisler: In a lift.

00:15:52.907 --> 00:15:53.047
David Boder: Yes?

00:15:53.047 --> 00:15:54.064
Adolph Heisler: We went down in a lift.

00:15:54.064 --> 00:15:56.134
David Boder: Who showed you how to work?

00:15:56.134 --> 00:15:59.887
Adolph Heisler: Yes, there was everywhere a Polish civilian, a foreman.

00:15:59.887 --> 00:16:02.274
David Boder: Yes? Were they good to you?

00:16:02.274 --> 00:16:04.909
Adolph Heisler: Yes, they were still worse than the Germans themselves.

00:16:04.909 --> 00:16:05.483
David Boder: Why?

00:16:05.483 --> 00:16:15.540
Adolph Heisler: They treated us much worse than the Germans. They informed on us. They beat [us]. It was terrible the way the Poles treated us there...

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:15.619
David Boder: Hm.

00:16:15.619 --> 00:16:16.827
Adolph Heisler: ...in the coal mines.

00:16:16.827 --> 00:16:18.189
David Boder: Hm.

00:16:18.189 --> 00:16:22.461
Adolph Heisler: And they beat us, the prisoners, to death.

00:16:22.461 --> 00:16:24.972
David Boder: Did you not try sometimes to hit back?

00:16:24.972 --> 00:16:36.350
Adolph Heisler: But who had the strength? We were completely worn out. Completely starved from that liter of soup and two hundred grams of bread, and working in a coal mine, we had no mine [?] any more to fight back.

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:42.718
David Boder: Nu, go on. How long did you work there in the coal mines? And where did your brother go?

00:16:42.718 --> 00:16:44.865
Adolph Heisler: I knew nothing more about the brother.

00:16:44.865 --> 00:16:45.307
David Boder: Aha.

00:16:45.307 --> 00:16:47.510
Adolph Heisler: From the brother I have only now through that girl...

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:47.665
David Boder: Yes.

00:16:47.665 --> 00:16:49.429
Adolph Heisler: ...received news.

00:16:49.429 --> 00:16:52.083
David Boder: And so how long did it last?

00:16:52.083 --> 00:17:02.160
Adolph Heisler: It lasted until the year...year...until the Russians arrived. Then [?] in Auschwitz...they started attacking Upper Silesia. That was in ’45.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.006
David Boder: Then how long were you in Auschwitz?

00:17:05.006 --> 00:17:05.812
Adolph Heisler: Two years.

00:17:05.812 --> 00:17:08.168
David Boder: Did you work in the coal mines all the time?

00:17:08.168 --> 00:17:09.051
Adolph Heisler: Yes.

00:17:09.051 --> 00:17:10.077
David Boder: As a coal miner

00:17:10.077 --> 00:17:10.682
Adolph Heisler: Yes.

00:17:10.682 --> 00:17:13.057
David Boder: [Jokingly:] So you are now a good coal miner, no?

00:17:13.057 --> 00:17:14.782
Adolph Heisler: Yes, a pretty good one.

00:17:14.782 --> 00:17:23.522
David Boder: Yes. Nu, and...and then when you came out from the mines, what would happen then?

00:17:23.522 --> 00:17:33.409
Adolph Heisler: When we came out we were counted [to see] if everybody is present, if none is missing, and we were led into the lager. There we bathed. Everyone had...

00:17:33.409 --> 00:17:34.397
David Boder: Every evening?

00:17:34.397 --> 00:17:35.749
Adolph Heisler: Bathed every evening.

00:17:35.749 --> 00:17:36.239
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:36.239 --> 00:17:41.718
Adolph Heisler: That was a good thing, that bath, that we were still able to bathe. And after the bath we were...

00:17:41.718 --> 00:17:41.931
David Boder: Yes...[?]

00:17:41.931 --> 00:17:48.338
Adolph Heisler: We got the supper which was a piece of bread and a [portion of] black coffee, and we went to bed.

00:17:48.338 --> 00:17:50.925
David Boder: Yes. What kind of beds did you have?

00:17:50.925 --> 00:17:57.580
Adolph Heisler: They were wooden plank-beds, such tiered beds, four stories high. We slept on the boards. Every...

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:00.009
David Boder: How many people to a plank-bed?

00:18:00.009 --> 00:18:04.952
Adolph Heisler: Yes. There were...on...approximately on one meter slept four, five people. There were...

00:18:04.952 --> 00:18:06.954
David Boder: Did you take off your clothes?

00:18:06.954 --> 00:18:09.838
Adolph Heisler: No, it was too cold for undressing.

00:18:09.838 --> 00:18:11.451
Adolph Heisler: Did you have any blankets?

00:18:11.451 --> 00:18:14.750
Adolph Heisler: We had one blanket for [number not clear], and sometimes not even one.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:16.392
David Boder: Did you have lice?

00:18:16.392 --> 00:18:18.697
Adolph Heisler: There is no question about it. We had very many lice.

00:18:18.697 --> 00:18:20.718
David Boder: And so, slowly. You had many lice.

00:18:20.718 --> 00:18:22.456
Adolph Heisler: Yes.

00:18:22.456 --> 00:18:27.681
David Boder: And so you say you had many lice, but you said you were bathed every day. Nu?

00:18:27.681 --> 00:18:41.792
Adolph Heisler: Yes, we bathed and still there were lice. For the reason...because we did...we did not have enough soap, and in the underwear and in the beds the lice always remained. When we would come home, at home we always lay down in the same things.

00:18:41.792 --> 00:18:44.383
David Boder: Nu, what was done about it?

00:18:44.383 --> 00:19:01.757
Adolph Heisler: And so, not much was done about it, because there was a very great crowd of people. In one barrack there were two, three hundred people. And there could not...care was taken so that it should go away [rid ourselves], but not enough care could be taken.

00:19:01.757 --> 00:19:04.940
David Boder: Nu, what happened when someone became sick?

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:12.048
Adolph Heisler: When someone became sick he was taken away, or he was given a thrust [injection] to make him die faster. And if not...

00:19:12.048 --> 00:19:13.551
David Boder: What does that mean? He was given what?

00:19:13.551 --> 00:19:15.804
Adolph Heisler: Given a push [injection?, booster?] to make him die faster.

00:19:15.804 --> 00:19:16.050
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:22.630
Adolph Heisler: He would even...even request it himself, because he would...life was not that good that he should desire to recover.

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:25.804
David Boder: Nu?

00:19:25.804 --> 00:19:36.213
Adolph Heisler: And if one was not so critically ill, there was a...a sick-ward. It was a hospital. And the wounds would be bandaged when one would hurt himself, or something like that.

00:19:36.213 --> 00:19:41.545
David Boder: Aha. Nu? And thus you worked all the time in the...

00:19:41.545 --> 00:19:47.196
Adolph Heisler: Yes, we worked. We had no free Saturday nor Sunday.

00:19:47.196 --> 00:19:48.322
David Boder: No Sunday?

00:19:48.322 --> 00:19:49.206
Adolph Heisler: No, nothing.

00:19:49.206 --> 00:19:49.769
David Boder: Hm.

00:19:49.769 --> 00:19:50.634
Adolph Heisler: Always working.

00:19:50.634 --> 00:19:54.108
David Boder: Was there any holiday that you did not work?

00:19:54.108 --> 00:19:57.422
Adolph Heisler: Yes, on New Year’s we had a free day.

00:19:57.422 --> 00:19:57.942
David Boder: New Year.

00:19:57.942 --> 00:19:58.382
Adolph Heisler: New Year.

00:19:58.382 --> 00:20:00.223
David Boder: Or Christmas?

00:20:00.223 --> 00:20:01.273
Adolph Heisler: Christmas, no.

00:20:01.273 --> 00:20:02.046
David Boder: But New Year.

00:20:02.046 --> 00:20:02.921
Adolph Heisler: New Year, yes.

00:20:02.921 --> 00:20:05.106
David Boder: So what did you do that day?

00:20:05.106 --> 00:20:12.494
Adolph Heisler: What we...There were three shifts. I always worked on the noon shift. So we got up at eight o’clock in the morning.

00:20:12.494 --> 00:20:12.747
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:12.747 --> 00:20:21.428
Adolph Heisler: And we washed up and got a coffee, a black coffee. And until dinner we idled around.

00:20:21.428 --> 00:20:21.625
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:21.625 --> 00:20:35.561
Adolph Heisler: And I went...I was not...I was young, and I was able to get along [?], so I went there to a block to sweep up. I had a little protection [favoritism] from the block elder, so I would always get a little extra soup.

00:20:35.561 --> 00:20:35.656
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:35.656 --> 00:20:37.572
Adolph Heisler: And that kept me going.

00:20:37.572 --> 00:20:39.332
David Boder: Aha. But you worked for it.

00:20:39.332 --> 00:20:41.954
Adolph Heisler: Yes, for that I did extra work in the lager.

00:20:41.954 --> 00:20:44.269
David Boder: Aha. Nu, and then?

00:20:44.269 --> 00:20:44.966
Adolph Heisler: And then came...

00:20:44.966 --> 00:20:48.675
David Boder: From there you walked every day eight kilometers to work?

00:20:48.675 --> 00:20:51.706
Adolph Heisler: No. The work was not so far. We walked three kilometers.

00:20:51.706 --> 00:20:52.637
David Boder: Three kilometers there.

00:20:52.637 --> 00:20:52.720
Adolph Heisler: Yes.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.939
David Boder: And three kilometer back.

00:20:53.939 --> 00:20:54.529
Adolph Heisler: Yes.

00:20:54.529 --> 00:20:55.458
David Boder: Go on.

00:20:55.458 --> 00:21:07.639
Adolph Heisler: At eleven o’clock we ate dinner. Everyone got the liter...the liter of soup, and we went down to work. We marched out by details, guarded...guarded by the SS, and we went down.

00:21:07.639 --> 00:21:09.867
David Boder: Did you sing while going to work?

00:21:09.867 --> 00:21:13.539
Adolph Heisler: [Bitterly:] It was already singing for us. - - - - without...without our singing.

00:21:13.539 --> 00:21:15.767
David Boder: What do you mean by that?

00:21:15.767 --> 00:21:17.535
Adolph Heisler: We had no mood for singing.

00:21:17.535 --> 00:21:19.845
David Boder: Yes, but it is said that the SS demanded it.

00:21:19.845 --> 00:21:26.643
Adolph Heisler: From us they did not demand it. There were some lagers, yes. There were lagers where they did demand it just to make fun, but not from us.

00:21:26.643 --> 00:21:27.105
David Boder: Aha.

00:21:27.105 --> 00:21:33.472
Adolph Heisler: They just yelled all the time. The people were falling on their feet, so they would call, ‘Left, two, left, two,’ to keep in step.

00:21:33.472 --> 00:21:35.764
David Boder: Nu, and then?

00:21:35.764 --> 00:21:40.013
Adolph Heisler: And then we would ride down. There [in the mine] everyone knew his work-place.

00:21:40.013 --> 00:21:40.328
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:40.328 --> 00:21:53.080
Adolph Heisler: We arrived there. The civilian [foreman] arrived, too, and we worked in the...in the props. That means in the coal...it was sixty meters high. There we had to bend down...[corrects himself] sixty centimeters...

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:53.567
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:53.567 --> 00:21:57.448
Adolph Heisler: ...high. And there we had to work lying down the whole eight hours.

00:21:57.448 --> 00:21:57.878
David Boder: Nu?

00:21:57.878 --> 00:22:19.352
Adolph Heisler: And to throw, shovel beneath yourself. And that lasted for eight hours without...without rest. Nothing. Thus we worked the eight hours. Every eight hours the shift was changed. The others came, and we left. We arrived in the lager, and like I said, we bathed and went again to bed.

00:22:19.352 --> 00:22:19.990
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:23.880
Adolph Heisler: Thus it went on until [one] thousand, nine...until ’44.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.260
David Boder: You told me you had a free day on New Year.

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:27.517
Adolph Heisler: Yes.

00:22:27.517 --> 00:22:29.759
David Boder: What did you do on that day?

00:22:29.759 --> 00:22:34.113
Adolph Heisler: What? We caught up on our sleep. We were very happy that we could get some rest.

00:22:34.113 --> 00:22:34.833
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:22:34.833 --> 00:22:37.075
Adolph Heisler: Everyone slept the whole day.

00:22:37.075 --> 00:22:37.359
David Boder: Nu?

00:22:37.359 --> 00:22:39.956
Adolph Heisler: Whatever one could.

00:22:39.956 --> 00:22:42.116
David Boder: And so that lasted how long?

00:22:42.116 --> 00:22:46.716
Adolph Heisler: That lasted until, I believe, ’45. Then the Russians...

00:22:46.716 --> 00:22:47.073
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:47.073 --> 00:22:56.813
Adolph Heisler: In December of ’44 the Russians made an attack on the region. So we started to go away from there. We left the coal mines, and...

00:22:56.813 --> 00:22:58.508
David Boder: What do you mean, you left? You were led away?

00:22:58.508 --> 00:22:59.592
Adolph Heisler: Yes, taken away.

00:22:59.592 --> 00:23:01.496
David Boder: Nu, and where were you led?

00:23:01.496 --> 00:23:04.626
Adolph Heisler: And so, we took to the road on foot.

00:23:04.626 --> 00:23:07.053
David Boder: What did they do with the coal mines? Were the mines...

00:23:07.053 --> 00:23:07.866
Adolph Heisler: Abandoned.

00:23:07.866 --> 00:23:08.813
David Boder: Yes, abandoned.

00:23:08.813 --> 00:23:28.488
Adolph Heisler: And so we...we had...we were eight kilometers from Auschwitz, so we saw Auschwitz burning. They set everything on fire, the entire lager. The crematories were bombed [blasted]. They demolished everything. And we walked on foot. And so everyone had...in the last moments everybody was able to loot bread and everything, because everything was open. So everyone...

00:23:28.488 --> 00:23:29.671
David Boder: You could steal bread?

00:23:29.671 --> 00:23:30.250
Adolph Heisler: Yes.

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:30.838
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:30.838 --> 00:23:35.852
Adolph Heisler: And everyone grabbed a loaf. We killed each other for a piece of bread.

00:23:35.852 --> 00:23:36.359
David Boder: Nu?

00:23:36.359 --> 00:23:42.851
Adolph Heisler: And we walked on the road. There was snow of forty centimeters, a half meter of snow.

00:23:42.851 --> 00:23:44.665
David Boder: Slowly. Yes.

00:23:44.665 --> 00:23:53.771
Adolph Heisler: And we were not dressed well. But of course we had to walk very fast, because they were afraid of the Russians, that the Russians will catch up with us.

00:23:53.771 --> 00:23:54.393
David Boder: Nu?

00:23:54.393 --> 00:23:55.945
Adolph Heisler: And we had to...

00:23:55.945 --> 00:23:59.615
David Boder: Why did they not want the Russians to get hold of the prisoners?

00:23:59.615 --> 00:24:15.213
Adolph Heisler: Why? Why should they want [that]? They were afraid, of course, that we would tell all those stories so that the whole world would know. Now the whole world does know all the stories, but...and then we were of use to them for work. We were then transported to Buchenwald.

00:24:15.213 --> 00:24:18.260
David Boder: Aha. And so you were walking. How far did you walk on foot?

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:22.697
Adolph Heisler: We walked a hundred and forty kilometers on foot. It was in two days.

00:24:22.697 --> 00:24:23.315
David Boder: Yes?

00:24:23.315 --> 00:24:33.473
Adolph Heisler: And one night we slept, because the SS themselves could not walk any more. They were healthy, it is true, but they, too, had no more strength, because we made eighty kilometers.

00:24:33.473 --> 00:24:34.733
David Boder: Slowly.

00:24:34.733 --> 00:24:40.472
Adolph Heisler: [After] the eighty kilometers we arrived there. We were chased into a field...

00:24:40.472 --> 00:24:40.786
David Boder: Yes?

00:24:40.786 --> 00:24:49.542
Adolph Heisler: ...of snow, and there they began to shoot, and then they said for everybody to lie down, because they did not want us to stand.

00:24:49.542 --> 00:24:49.669
David Boder: Yes.

00:24:49.669 --> 00:25:02.992
Adolph Heisler: And there was no room to stand on that field. And they said to lie down. And they began to yell. One simply fell on top of another, because they were shooting over our heads. Many also fell there.

00:25:02.992 --> 00:25:05.180
David Boder: Why did they want you to lie down?

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:07.385
Adolph Heisler: They had such a fantasy in their heads.

00:25:07.385 --> 00:25:08.199
David Boder: Nu?

00:25:08.199 --> 00:25:47.896
Adolph Heisler: And everything [everybody] lay down. And there was snow and a severe frost. The night was terribly cold. I myself was surprised how I lived through it a whole night. I had fallen into the snow, and I slept there. In the morning I arose completely wet, because the snow had melted. I am surprised today how I pulled through that night. And in the morning we got up, and fifty per cent remained lying there in the snow. And the rest that had remained, we had to bury them there, dig ditches and bury them. And we went on.

00:25:47.896 --> 00:25:49.629
David Boder: With what did you dig the ditches?

00:25:49.629 --> 00:25:52.119
Adolph Heisler: They had brought tools.

00:25:52.119 --> 00:25:52.860
David Boder: They had brought tools.

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:53.540
Adolph Heisler: Yes.

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:57.692
David Boder: And what was done to those who were not yet dead?

00:25:57.692 --> 00:26:00.478
Adolph Heisler: We had to bury them?

00:26:00.478 --> 00:26:02.336
David Boder: The living?

00:26:02.336 --> 00:26:05.156
Adolph Heisler: No. The living had to bury the dead.

00:26:05.156 --> 00:26:07.130
David Boder: Yes, but the ones who were sick?

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:13.551
Adolph Heisler: They were also while still ali-...alive thrown into the grave. Who...whoever was not able to walk was shot and thrown into the grave.

00:26:13.551 --> 00:26:15.599
David Boder: Shot and thrown into the grave.

00:26:15.599 --> 00:26:22.258
Adolph Heisler: Yes. But there were also many people on the road who were not able to walk any more, so they would take a blanket over the head, put the head in it...

00:26:22.258 --> 00:26:22.437
David Boder: Yes.

00:26:22.437 --> 00:26:25.678
Adolph Heisler: ...and sit down. The SS man would pass by and finish him off with a shot.

00:26:25.678 --> 00:26:28.669
David Boder: Did he at least see if the man was dead when he shot him?

00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:33.713
Adolph Heisler: If he was not dead he remained that way. He waited until he died [?].

00:26:33.713 --> 00:26:36.231
David Boder: Hm. Nu?

00:26:36.231 --> 00:26:47.289
Adolph Heisler: And the next day, after we buried them, we walked on. They said we still have fifty kilometers to a train. And there we will board a train, because here they do not have a free [proper] railroad station for...

00:26:47.289 --> 00:26:51.137
David Boder: One moment. [Adjusting the equipment.] And so go on. It was fifty kilometers to the train.

00:26:51.137 --> 00:27:33.839
Adolph Heisler: Yes. And we walked the fifty kilometers still on foot. Many people fell on the way, because they could not...not make it. So they were shot there on the road, and left lying thus on the road. And we, who were still able to make it, arrived there, at a railroad station. It was in Breslau, I believe. And there we waited for RR-cars. And after several hours — we sat there in the snow — after several hours rr- cars arrived, and we boarded the RR-cars. But the RR-cars were also terrible, because the RR-cars were, of course, completely open, without roofs. They were those half-RR-cars [flat cars or gondolas]. There was much snow, and we had to sit in the snow.

00:27:33.839 --> 00:27:35.884
David Boder: There was snow in the RR-cars?

00:27:35.884 --> 00:27:37.822
Adolph Heisler: Yes, because they were without roofs.

00:27:37.822 --> 00:27:38.456
David Boder: Yes.

00:27:38.456 --> 00:27:46.103
Adolph Heisler: And we sat there in the snow. And the journey to Buchenwald took eight days. We did not know...

00:27:46.103 --> 00:27:48.476
David Boder: Were there any SS with you in the RR-cars?

00:27:48.476 --> 00:27:50.191
Adolph Heisler: Yes. There was an SS man in each RR-car.

00:27:50.191 --> 00:27:52.888
David Boder: And where was the SS standing, also in the snow?

00:27:52.888 --> 00:27:54.755
Adolph Heisler: Yes, but he, of course, was well dressed.

00:27:54.755 --> 00:27:55.123
David Boder: Yes.

00:27:55.123 --> 00:28:00.891
Adolph Heisler: And they were constantly changing [the guard]. On ever...every stations others would take over.

00:28:00.891 --> 00:28:01.253
David Boder: Aha.

00:28:01.253 --> 00:28:05.287
Adolph Heisler: And at the end there were two RR-cars, passenger cars, which were heated.

00:28:05.287 --> 00:28:05.481
David Boder: Yes.

00:28:05.481 --> 00:28:07.218
Adolph Heisler: And the SS were living there.

00:28:07.218 --> 00:28:07.509
David Boder: Yes.

00:28:07.509 --> 00:28:09.342
Adolph Heisler: And the guards would always be changed.

00:28:09.342 --> 00:28:16.820
David Boder: Well, if you were together for so many days, didn’t people talk to the SS man? Didn’t people talk with him? Didn’t he himself talk?

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:24.964
Adolph Heisler: Yes, he said.... There would be a good one. So he wanted to talk, and there would be a mean one who would take the rifle and beat one if one said a word to him.

00:28:24.964 --> 00:28:25.036
David Boder: Hm.

00:28:25.036 --> 00:28:29.013
Adolph Heisler: It was the response [?] if one still dared to open [one’s mouth] to say a word to him.

00:28:29.013 --> 00:28:29.455
David Boder: Nu?

00:28:29.455 --> 00:28:46.183
Adolph Heisler: The same trick they would also do in the lager. One would be walking along, and he [the prisoner] greated him. So he [the SS] would come over to him and ask whether he is his comrade [implying that such an idea was, of course, presumptuous] that he greets him. If he [the prisoner] did not greet, then he would ask why he does not greet him. So he would also beat him. So we would not know ourselves what to do.

00:28:46.183 --> 00:28:46.320
David Boder: Hm.

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:50.044
Adolph Heisler: If there was a good one, he would talk. So we would ask him where we were being taken.

00:28:50.044 --> 00:28:50.432
David Boder: Nu?

00:28:50.432 --> 00:28:58.875
Adolph Heisler: So he said he does not know himself. He also has [just] an order from the headquarters, and he does not know either where we are being taken.

00:28:58.875 --> 00:28:59.225
David Boder: Nu?

00:28:59.225 --> 00:29:01.739
Adolph Heisler: But then we saw that we are arriving in Buchenwald.

00:29:01.739 --> 00:29:01.915
David Boder: How?

00:29:01.915 --> 00:29:02.859
Adolph Heisler: When we arrived...

00:29:02.859 --> 00:29:03.058
David Boder: Yes.

00:29:03.058 --> 00:29:06.712
Adolph Heisler: ...there, after eight days riding on the...on the train...

00:29:06.712 --> 00:29:07.749
David Boder: Nu?

00:29:07.749 --> 00:29:11.920
Adolph Heisler: We arrived there in Buchenwald. But we were already very weak from the journey.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:12.405
David Boder: Yes.

00:29:12.405 --> 00:29:22.878
Adolph Heisler: My own head was spinning after the bath. We were bathed there, because by the Germans the ones arriving in an...another lager were bathed.

00:29:22.878 --> 00:29:23.501
David Boder: Nu, what does it mean...

00:29:23.501 --> 00:29:24.113
Adolph Heisler: Disinfection.

00:29:24.113 --> 00:29:25.300
David Boder: ...your head was spinning?

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:28.273
Adolph Heisler: Yes. I could not...I could not come to myself.

00:29:28.273 --> 00:29:29.403
David Boder: What does that mean?

00:29:29.403 --> 00:29:34.864
Adolph Heisler: I became weak after the bath. I was very weak and after a hot bath...

00:29:34.864 --> 00:29:34.992
David Boder: Nu?

00:29:34.992 --> 00:29:38.911
Adolph Heisler: That sort of melted my bones, because I was completely frozen.

00:29:38.911 --> 00:29:39.088
David Boder: Yes.

00:29:39.088 --> 00:29:41.919
Adolph Heisler: I was hardly able to walk over to the bath.

00:29:41.919 --> 00:29:42.293
David Boder: Nu?

00:29:42.293 --> 00:29:49.799
Adolph Heisler: And then I was...after a hot bath my head was spinning. So I sat down for a little while and more or less came to myself.

00:29:49.799 --> 00:29:45.757
David Boder: Aha.

00:29:45.757 --> 00:30:31.291
Adolph Heisler: Then we were sent...after the bath we were sent into.... There they again shore us everywhere [?]. The hair was shorn off all over, and we were led into blocks...into barracks. And there we were for two days in the barracks. And suddenly we hear [that] we are going to work again, to another place. And in the other place we were chased out one early morning in the snow. The whole block was called out, and we were not told where we were going, and it was also a cold day, and we were packed into RR-cars. And we rode one day. It was good that it did not take any longer.

00:30:31.291 --> 00:30:32.432
David Boder: Again from Buchenwald?

00:30:32.432 --> 00:30:36.309
Adolph Heisler: From Buchenwald to ano-...it was in Germany itself, in Thuringia.

00:30:36.309 --> 00:30:36.993
David Boder: Yes.

00:30:36.993 --> 00:30:37.854
Adolph Heisler: Karawinki [or Trawinki — the recording is not clear; both names appear incorrect unless we deal with a makeshift name invented by the prisoners].

00:30:37.854 --> 00:30:38.539
David Boder: Hm.

00:30:38.539 --> 00:30:43.867
Adolph Heisler: And we arrived in a lager. And so there [it] was much worse yet than in the coal mines.

00:30:43.867 --> 00:30:44.230
David Boder: Yes.

00:30:44.230 --> 00:00:00.000
Adolph Heisler: It was a lager [word not clear]. There were munition depots. And we lived in a cellar, in underground bunkers.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:30:52.671
David Boder: Yes.

00:30:52.671 --> 00:30:53.783
Adolph Heisler: In a forest.

00:30:53.783 --> 00:30:54.001
David Boder: Nu?

00:30:54.001 --> 00:30:58.014
Adolph Heisler: And there the...the...the treatment was much worse than anywhere else.

00:30:58.014 --> 00:30:59.321
David Boder: Why?

00:30:59.321 --> 00:31:14.703
Adolph Heisler: Because there we did not bathe. There [in other camps] one still could bathe. We had no water. Three months passed that we did not have any water on our faces whatsoever with which to wash ourselves. And the lice ate us up completely.

00:31:14.703 --> 00:31:16.542
David Boder: What did you do there?

00:31:16.542 --> 00:31:21.040
Adolph Heisler: Worked. Dug various ditches. Loaded munitions.

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:21.573
David Boder: Aha.

00:31:21.573 --> 00:31:25.800
Adolph Heisler: They were building there a large factory in a...underneath a forest.

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.069
David Boder: In ’45 already?

00:31:27.069 --> 00:31:27.601
Adolph Heisler: In ’45.

00:31:27.601 --> 00:31:29.020
David Boder: An underground factory...

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:29.281
Adolph Heisler: Yes.

00:31:29.281 --> 00:31:31.670
David Boder: ...they were building there. Nu?

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:48.197
Adolph Heisler: And there it was something terrible. I talked there to some people from Poland who had been there already for six years. They said they had gone through the worst lagers, Majdanek, Treblinka, but they were never in such a place.

00:31:48.197 --> 00:31:48.944
David Boder: Nu?

00:31:48.944 --> 00:31:57.961
Adolph Heisler: And there we were.... Then I, too, became sick from the many lice, in the last two weeks before the liberation.

00:31:57.961 --> 00:31:58.913
David Boder: Yes?

00:31:58.913 --> 00:32:07.923
Adolph Heisler: When I became sick, I went to a doctor for eight days. Would always go in the evenings, pleading that I cannot work. He did not want to believe me.

00:32:07.923 --> 00:32:09.164
David Boder: Was he a Jewish doctor?

00:32:09.164 --> 00:32:09.752
Adolph Heisler: Yes.

00:32:09.752 --> 00:32:10.238
David Boder: Yes?

00:32:10.238 --> 00:32:19.959
Adolph Heisler: From Poland, a Jew. He...he was a very mean one. There were also among the Jews themselves very bad people. Because they would...very brutal persons.

00:32:19.959 --> 00:32:21.341
David Boder: Yes?

00:32:21.341 --> 00:32:41.606
Adolph Heisler: And then he...he spared me, because, after all, I was young. I was then seventeen years old. And he put me in the hospital, in the sick-ward. There I was eight days. Then I was sent on a transport that was being sent to the crematory.

00:32:41.606 --> 00:32:43.296
David Boder: Where were the crematories there?

00:32:43.296 --> 00:32:53.183
Adolph Heisler: They were near. Eight kilometers from there was also a lager, a big lager, Ohrdurf [?]. And there they also had set up a crematory.

00:32:53.183 --> 00:32:55.600
David Boder: Did they gas the people there?

00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:10.227
Adolph Heisler: No, they would just kill them, finish.... They were anyway already half dead. So they would just kill them with rifles or what not [?]. But it was our luck that the Americans were already...

00:33:10.227 --> 00:33:14.314
David Boder: Now where were you when the Americans arrived?

00:33:14.314 --> 00:33:21.517
Adolph Heisler: We were there in that...in that lager where we had been taken to be pulver-...to be gassed. And we...

00:33:21.517 --> 00:33:23.654
David Boder: What does it mean, in a lager to be.... In which lager was it?

00:33:23.654 --> 00:33:27.508
Adolph Heisler: It was in Ohrdurf. After I became sick I was naturally taken away from there.

00:33:27.508 --> 00:33:28.617
David Boder: Where to?

00:33:28.617 --> 00:33:37.342
Adolph Heisler: Eight kilometers away there was a lager where people would be...there was a crematory. The people who...from there would come very many sick people. Because of the...it was terrible there.

00:33:37.342 --> 00:33:38.527
David Boder: Yes.

00:33:38.527 --> 00:33:41.979
Adolph Heisler: So they were there killed and burned.

00:33:41.979 --> 00:33:43.298
David Boder: Nu?

00:33:43.298 --> 00:33:53.778
Adolph Heisler: And when we arrived, it was already the last transport. They did not have any more time for it. They...they were already busy with themselves, because the Americans were already approaching it [the lager].

00:33:53.778 --> 00:33:54.593
David Boder: Yes.

00:33:54.593 --> 00:34:09.145
Adolph Heisler: And we lay there another eight days. And we were supposed to remain there until the lager will be shot...all the people there will be shot, or they will blast the lager [with explosives], or something like that.

00:34:09.145 --> 00:34:09.650
David Boder: Hm.

00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:16.182
Adolph Heisler: And luckily we were taken and transported to Buchenwald from there.

00:34:16.182 --> 00:34:16.942
David Boder: Transported back to Buchenwald.

00:34:16.942 --> 00:34:18.443
Adolph Heisler: Yes, and so...

00:34:18.443 --> 00:34:19.029
David Boder: Nu?

00:34:19.029 --> 00:34:31.977
Adolph Heisler: But with me it was a special stroke of luck. I don’t know how I succeeded in that whole affair, because all were transported in the rr-... [correcting himself] on foot.

00:34:31.977 --> 00:34:32.161
David Boder: Yes.

00:34:32.161 --> 00:34:43.282
Adolph Heisler: And I had told myself — there were [other] sick people — I am not going on foot any more. Let them kill me here. I have to go and suffer and then die? I decided to die here on the spot.

00:34:43.282 --> 00:34:44.307
David Boder: Nu?

00:34:44.307 --> 00:34:52.910
Adolph Heisler: And then there came, in the last moment, trucks, and the sick were loaded on the trucks, and they were taken away.

00:34:52.910 --> 00:34:53.734
David Boder: To Buchenwald?

00:34:53.734 --> 00:34:54.311
Adolph Heisler: Yes.

00:34:54.311 --> 00:34:54.760
David Boder: Nu?

00:34:54.760 --> 00:35:06.748
Adolph Heisler: And that was our luck. [The following note was inserted in the first-draft translation by Mr. Bernard Wolf who himself was in Buchenwald at that time: He is probably referring here to the death march from Ohrdurf to Buchenwald. ‘Twelve thousand prisoners left Ohrdurf, less than half arrived in Buchenwald.’] From there we came to Buchenwald, and we were pushed into.... We believed that.... In Buchenwald we were put near the crematory, so we believed that we were being taken to the crematory, but luckily...

00:35:06.748 --> 00:35:07.471
David Boder: Yes?

00:35:07.471 --> 00:35:19.060
Adolph Heisler: ...we were not [taken] to the crematory, but were [taken] to the old lager, among the people who were in quarantine. And we were lodged there for a few days.

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:20.176
David Boder: And then?

00:35:20.176 --> 00:35:32.553
Adolph Heisler: But we knew that the Americans were already near, because they were advancing rapidly. Every night we could hear the shooting. And Buchenwald, too, began to be evacuated to...to take away the people.

00:35:32.553 --> 00:35:34.309
David Boder: Where to?

00:35:34.309 --> 00:35:36.148
Adolph Heisler: Well, I don’t know where to.

00:35:36.148 --> 00:35:36.330
David Boder: Yes.

00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:45.412
Adolph Heisler: Because I remained there still. And it was said that those who could walk, go, and who cannot walk, he...then the lager will be destroyed.

00:35:45.412 --> 00:35:45.659
David Boder: Yes.

00:35:45.659 --> 00:35:46.950
Adolph Heisler: In the last hour.

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:47.522
David Boder: Yes.

00:35:47.522 --> 00:35:56.295
Adolph Heisler: And the healthy people went, but our block said we are not going. They should kill us here, and we shall remain here.

00:35:56.295 --> 00:35:57.205
David Boder: Hm.

00:35:57.205 --> 00:36:08.943
Adolph Heisler: And...but still on the next day — it was on Sunday — the SS came and began to throw [us] out through the windows and to chase.

00:36:08.943 --> 00:36:10.960
David Boder: Threw out, what?

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.060
Adolph Heisler: Threw us out the windows.

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:13.653
David Boder: Yes. They threw out the people?

00:36:13.653 --> 00:36:13.998
Adolph Heisler: Yes.

00:36:13.998 --> 00:36:14.190
David Boder: Yes.

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:20.137
Adolph Heisler: Through the windows. And started to drive [them] to the appell square, and from there we should be taken for evacuation.

00:36:20.137 --> 00:36:22.199
David Boder: On what story [floor] was it [in the hospital]?

00:36:22.199 --> 00:36:25.994
Adolph Heisler: It was on...it had no stories.

00:36:25.994 --> 00:36:28.690
David Boder: Why through the windows and not through the doors?

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:30.359
Adolph Heisler: Because nobody wanted to go.

00:36:30.359 --> 00:36:31.403
David Boder: Aha. And?

00:36:31.403 --> 00:36:33.926
Adolph Heisler: Everyone was reluctant to be evacuated.

00:36:33.926 --> 00:36:34.528
David Boder: Yes.

00:36:34.528 --> 00:36:44.266
Adolph Heisler: And they poured water over these people. Nobody wan-...they still did not carry it out, because the people told themselves.... They called to their faces to shoot them.

00:36:44.266 --> 00:36:44.993
David Boder: Nu?

00:36:44.993 --> 00:36:56.328
Adolph Heisler: But they did not shoot. I do not know why. And on the next day, the same story. Finally they succeeded. They assembled the people on the appell square.

00:36:56.328 --> 00:36:57.237
David Boder: Yes.

00:36:57.237 --> 00:37:03.587
Adolph Heisler: And I went up there, too. And I saw standing there a transport of youths [youngsters].

00:37:03.587 --> 00:37:03.769
David Boder: Yes.

00:37:03.769 --> 00:37:13.830
Adolph Heisler: And that was for a reason [?]. They had been selected to remain in the lager. They were not suitable for transport. And so I went over there. I, of course, am young too.

00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:14.465
David Boder: Hm.

00:37:14.465 --> 00:37:57.872
Adolph Heisler: And I went over and mingled in, and returned to the lager. And these people left on a transport. And this was on Tuesday already. And on Wednesday...that day was the eighth day that we were completely without food. Wednesday morning we heard the shooting on the part of the Germans [?], and at ten o’clock we heard an enemy...enemy alarm [to be sounded on the approach of the enemy]. The Americans had arrived, one American tank, and went back. And by eleven o’clock planes came over. And at three-thirty we were liberated by the Americans. The first Americans had arrived. The Germans had abandoned the lager entirely.

00:37:57.872 --> 00:38:00.181
David Boder: When did the Germans abandon the lager?

00:38:00.181 --> 00:38:02.029
Adolph Heisler: They left at one o’clock in the afternoon.

00:38:02.029 --> 00:38:03.736
David Boder: What did they say?

00:38:03.736 --> 00:38:39.572
Adolph Heisler: Nothing. We only saw them leaving the watchtowers. It was so. Afterwards we dis-...dis-...discovered...heard that from Weimar the lager commander had telephoned to demolish the lager, [he telephoned] one hour after the liberation. He did not know yet that the lager had already been liberated. It was at half past four. So the lager elder — he was a prisoner — answered him, ‘Yes, yes, we will demolish their heads.’ If we had not been liberated an hour before, they would have demolished the lager.

00:38:39.572 --> 00:38:41.631
David Boder: What did he answer him?

00:38:41.631 --> 00:38:46.101
Adolph Heisler: That [now] he should already telephone to Lord God and not to us.

00:38:46.101 --> 00:38:48.527
David Boder: Aha. Nu?

00:38:48.527 --> 00:39:08.996
Adolph Heisler: And thus we were liberated. And so, [about] this liberation, people had imagined whole stories, great happiness, but many people also died after the liberation, because they received very fat food. And they completely ruined their stomachs. They got stomach aches, and they died from that, too.

00:39:08.996 --> 00:39:12.855
David Boder: Yes. And then where...

00:39:12.855 --> 00:39:22.741
Adolph Heisler: And then I was taken away to a youth block, and there I was for a certain time. There I became sick with spotted typhus.

00:39:22.741 --> 00:39:24.532
David Boder: After the liberation you had spotted typhus?

00:39:24.532 --> 00:39:24.998
Adolph Heisler: Yes.

00:39:24.998 --> 00:39:25.812
David Boder: Yes.

00:39:25.812 --> 00:39:34.347
Adolph Heisler: There I lay four weeks, and then I heard about the transport going to Switzerland. So I reported for it, to go to Switzerland.
