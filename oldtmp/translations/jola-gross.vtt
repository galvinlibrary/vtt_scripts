00:03:04.902 --> 00:03:09.922

00:03:31.165 --> 00:03:31.843
David Boder: It cannot disappear?

00:03:31.843 --> 00:03:32.386
Jola Gross: No.

00:03:32.386 --> 00:03:34.180

00:03:44.642 --> 00:04:08.055
Jola Gross: In the assembly lager life was also very hard. Every day the... the SS men were beating us. And one was also killed, but.... We were there four weeks, and then we were gathered together, three thousand, and we were embarked into RR-cars. We were eighty-four persons to a RR-car, and we were transported farther.

00:04:08.055 --> 00:04:13.211
David Boder: All right. Wait please. And so, in Auschwitz, were men and women taken?

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:14.748
David Boder: What?

00:04:14.748 --> 00:04:15.426

00:04:15.426 --> 00:04:16.572
David Boder: What does it mean, apart?

00:04:16.572 --> 00:04:18.396
Jola Gross: Apart, the men and women.

00:04:18.396 --> 00:04:19.527
David Boder: First men and and [then] the women?

00:04:19.527 --> 00:04:20.055
Jola Gross: The women, yes.

00:04:20.055 --> 00:04:22.211
David Boder: And what was done with the children?

00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:25.301
Jola Gross: It was thus. We arrived in Auschwitz [word not clear].

00:04:25.301 --> 00:04:27.472
David Boder: No. First about the assembly lager.

00:04:27.472 --> 00:04:30.065

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.252

00:04:32.252 --> 00:04:32.599
David Boder: Yes.

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:39.368
Jola Gross: We were together with the parents. And in the RR-cars we were also together, because we were loaded together in the wagons.

00:04:39.368 --> 00:04:43.333
David Boder: Yes. And so how did you live in Auschwitz? In a block? In barracks?

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:44.584
Jola Gross: In Auschwitz when we had...

00:04:44.584 --> 00:04:49.408
David Boder: No, no, no. Excuse me. In that other lager, in the assembly lager. How did you live there?

00:04:49.408 --> 00:04:51.198
Jola Gross: In the first lager...

00:04:51.198 --> 00:04:52.585
David Boder: Yes, yes.

00:04:52.585 --> 00:04:53.324

00:04:53.324 --> 00:04:54.696
David Boder: Yes. How did you live there?

00:04:54.696 --> 00:05:02.068
Jola Gross: Nu, we had there.... First we were still living... because from that town, Munkacs, the... the [local] people had not been taken yet.

00:05:02.068 --> 00:05:02.565

00:05:02.565 --> 00:05:04.781
Jola Gross: They sent us in some food.

00:05:04.781 --> 00:05:05.278
David Boder: Oh, those people...

00:05:05.278 --> 00:05:05.972
Jola Gross: The Jewish Council...

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:06.741
David Boder: The Jewish Council...

00:05:06.741 --> 00:05:07.902
Jola Gross: ... sent us in...

00:05:07.902 --> 00:05:08.776
David Boder: ... sent you in some food.

00:05:08.776 --> 00:05:09.168
Jola Gross: ... some food.

00:05:09.168 --> 00:05:10.630
David Boder: Where was that assembly lager?

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.836
Jola Gross: In Munkacs [Mukachevo].

00:05:11.836 --> 00:05:12.711
David Boder: In Munkacs.

00:05:12.711 --> 00:05:13.510

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:14.339
David Boder: Munkacs.

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:15.063
Jola Gross: Munkacs.

00:05:15.063 --> 00:05:17.942
David Boder: Did you work in that assembly lager?

00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:19.736
Jola Gross: No, no. There... there people...

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:22.736
David Boder: And how did you sleep, the women apart and the...

00:05:22.736 --> 00:05:23.701
Jola Gross: On... on the floor.

00:05:23.701 --> 00:05:26.324
David Boder: Yes, but apart, the women and the men apart?

00:05:26.324 --> 00:05:28.691
Jola Gross: No, families were together.

00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:31.540
David Boder: Famies were together with the children.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.023
Jola Gross: Yes.

00:05:32.023 --> 00:05:35.536
David Boder: Nu, yes. And what did you do all day?

00:05:35.536 --> 00:05:42.154
Jola Gross: Do? The men went to work and others... but it only lasted four weeks.

00:05:42.154 --> 00:05:44.114
David Boder: Yes. And?

00:05:44.114 --> 00:05:44.747
Jola Gross: Then we...

00:05:44.747 --> 00:05:48.456

00:05:48.456 --> 00:05:49.707

00:05:49.707 --> 00:05:50.325
David Boder: A Jew.

00:05:50.325 --> 00:05:50.687
Jola Gross: Yes.

00:05:50.687 --> 00:05:51.878
David Boder: And why was he killed?

00:05:51.878 --> 00:06:00.004
Jola Gross: Because in the morning he got out of... of the barrack, and... and they did no know who he was, and he was killed.

00:06:00.004 --> 00:06:01.165
David Boder: Was he shot?

00:06:01.165 --> 00:06:01.783
Jola Gross: Shot.

00:06:01.783 --> 00:06:03.456
David Boder: Yes. Nu? Go on.

00:06:03.456 --> 00:06:05.296
Jola Gross: [Pause.]

00:06:05.296 --> 00:06:07.331
David Boder: And then you were loaded in wagons?

00:06:07.331 --> 00:06:08.341
Jola Gross: Loaded on wagons.

00:06:08.341 --> 00:06:09.487
David Boder: Families together?

00:06:09.487 --> 00:06:15.170
Jola Gross: Yes, families together. It was on the 15th of May in the year ’44.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:16.949
David Boder: Yes. And?

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:22.588
Jola Gross: And we were... and on the 18th of May we [came] to Auschwitz.

00:06:22.588 --> 00:06:25.015
David Boder: How long did the journey take?

00:06:25.015 --> 00:06:27.005
Jola Gross: From the 15th to the 18th.

00:06:27.005 --> 00:06:28.528

00:06:28.814 --> 00:06:29.342
David Boder: ... of May...

00:06:29.342 --> 00:06:29.960
Jola Gross: Of May, yes.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.970
David Boder: ... you were en route. Were you fed on... given anything to eat on the road?

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.759
Jola Gross: No, no. We had taken along...

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:37.347
David Boder: Yes?

00:06:37.347 --> 00:06:46.317
Jola Gross: We had taken food along. And water we received very little. And early in the morning I asked for water...

00:06:46.317 --> 00:06:46.965
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:46.965 --> 00:06:50.342
Jola Gross: ... through the window. Says he, ‘You will soon be unloaded.’

00:06:50.342 --> 00:06:52.784
David Boder: Yes. What was there, a window in the wagon? Then it was...

00:06:52.784 --> 00:06:54.126
Jola Gross: It was such a tiny window...

00:06:54.126 --> 00:06:54.533
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:54.533 --> 00:06:55.181
Jola Gross: ... there was...

00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:56.885
David Boder: What was it, a passenger RR-car?

00:06:56.885 --> 00:06:59.644
Jola Gross: Yes, a passenger wagon [she apparently misunderstood the question]. Eighty-four we were.

00:06:59.644 --> 00:07:01.860
David Boder: Yes. Was there a toilet in the wagon?

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:02.554
Jola Gross: No.

00:07:02.554 --> 00:07:04.258
David Boder: No. So how did people...

00:07:04.258 --> 00:07:09.640
Jola Gross: Very difficult. Children... and it was very difficult. We tossed it through the window...

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.469
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:13.333
Jola Gross: ... in a ... in a thing we had it...

00:07:13.333 --> 00:07:14.087
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:14.087 --> 00:07:14.751
Jola Gross: ... we had such a thing [bucket?].

00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:15.490
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:21.083
Jola Gross: And then on the morning of the 18th we were unloaded.

00:07:21.083 --> 00:07:21.430
David Boder: yes?

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:33.702
Jola Gross: We didn’t know where we were, because we had stopped between two wagons [trains?], and when the wagon was opened the striped men have...

00:07:33.702 --> 00:07:34.324
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:34.324 --> 00:07:36.334
Jola Gross: ... opened the wagons, and have...

00:07:36.334 --> 00:07:37.722
David Boder: Who were the striped men?

00:07:37.722 --> 00:07:39.279
Jola Gross: They were already prisoners.

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:39.858
David Boder: Prisoners.

00:07:39.858 --> 00:07:41.826
Jola Gross: Also Jews, prisoners.

00:07:41.826 --> 00:07:42.448
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:42.448 --> 00:08:19.259
Jola Gross: And they said, ‘You leave your bundles and come down,’ and we asked [?], ‘What... what... what will be here?’ ‘Don’t ask, and leave your bundles. You don’t need any bundles.’ And we were taken down. We ask, ‘Don’t you know what is going to be done with us here?’ So the gentleman, the prisoner says, ‘Oi wei [oh, woe]. What will be done with you here’ [in a wailing voice]. So one woman says, ‘Should we... may we say Shema Israel?’ [Listen Israel, the first words of a universal, basic prayer used under conditions of anguish and distress.’ He says, ‘Oi wei [oh, woe]! I, too, have left here my wife and child.’ [In a lower voice:] People started to cry.

00:08:19.259 --> 00:08:22.054
David Boder: Speak louder. People started to cry.

00:08:22.054 --> 00:08:22.615
Jola Gross: Yes.

00:08:22.615 --> 00:08:23.569
David Boder: And so, go on.

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:44.654
Jola Gross: And then it was said that men should go separately and the women separately in rows of five. We arranged ourselves in rows of five, and we went separately. At the end of the wagon... at the end of the train there were standing two or three SS men. Among them was one Doctor Mengele.

00:08:44.654 --> 00:08:45.819
David Boder: Who was that Doctor?

00:08:45.819 --> 00:08:47.135
Jola Gross: Doctor Mengele.

00:08:47.135 --> 00:08:48.240
David Boder: A German?

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.646
Jola Gross: A German SS man.

00:08:49.646 --> 00:08:50.129
David Boder: Yes?

00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:56.256
Jola Gross: He was at the end, and he said one [some] should go here, right, and the others should go [to the] left.

00:08:56.256 --> 00:08:56.648
David Boder: Yes.

00:08:56.648 --> 00:09:04.845
Jola Gross: We didn’t know what it means, right and what is left. He sent some here and some to the other side.

00:09:04.845 --> 00:09:07.471
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:09.813
Jola Gross: And we went on.

00:09:09.813 --> 00:09:11.382
David Boder: And where did the children remain?

00:09:11.382 --> 00:09:14.401
Jola Gross: They also went left with the mothers.

00:09:14.401 --> 00:09:16.441
David Boder: The children went left.

00:09:16.441 --> 00:09:19.115
Jola Gross: Left, with the mother. Also the weak and the old...

00:09:19.115 --> 00:09:19.779
David Boder: Yes?

00:09:19.779 --> 00:09:25.833
Jola Gross: ... went left. Labor forces [those fit to work] went right, and we went on...

00:09:25.833 --> 00:09:27.041
David Boder: And where did you go?

00:09:27.041 --> 00:09:27.663
Jola Gross: Right.

00:09:27.663 --> 00:09:29.220
David Boder: Right. Why?

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.397
Jola Gross: Because, as labor force.

00:09:30.397 --> 00:09:31.019
David Boder: Yes.

00:09:31.019 --> 00:09:31.943
Jola Gross: He assigned me.

00:09:31.943 --> 00:09:32.263
David Boder: Yes.

00:09:32.263 --> 00:09:32.975
Jola Gross: ‘Right. Go!’

00:09:32.975 --> 00:09:37.641
David Boder: Nu? And so you went right. What happened then?

00:09:37.641 --> 00:09:40.496
Jola Gross: We went to bathe.

00:09:40.496 --> 00:09:41.148
David Boder: Yes?

00:09:41.148 --> 00:10:02.172
Jola Gross: It was written all over, ‘Desinfektion,’ that we are going to be disinfected. We came to the bathhouse, inside. So they.. all of us could not get in at one time. We were then a transport of six thousand. There were three thousand from Kozel [Kassel?], and we...

00:10:02.172 --> 00:10:02.776
David Boder: Yes.

00:10:02.776 --> 00:11:06.722
Jola Gross: And when we came there, fifty or sixty women were let in at a time, and we stood outside. While we stood outside we saw those who had gone left were walking by. We see them through the trees. They are walking with the children, the mothers and the sisters and the old. All are walking with the children... and are walking. We thought that they are going to join us. Then we heard a lot of crying and wailing. We also started to cry and to wail very much. We asked what is going on there, why they are crying. The bath was opened. The women... and said, ‘Everybody into the shower.’ We all went in, and we didn’t hear any more what happened to the others.

00:11:06.722 --> 00:11:09.246
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:11:09.246 --> 00:11:24.536
Jola Gross: Then when we were... we went into the bath. We were [told], ‘Take everything off.’ We took everything off, the clothes and everything. The hair was cut off, and we were...

00:11:24.536 --> 00:11:26.606
David Boder: Who did that, men or women?

00:11:26.606 --> 00:11:28.447
Jola Gross: Men and women.

00:11:28.447 --> 00:11:31.073
David Boder: Yes. Cut off your hair.

00:11:31.073 --> 00:11:32.027
Jola Gross: Cut off, yes.

00:11:32.027 --> 00:11:32.558
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:32.558 --> 00:11:36.560
Jola Gross: And then we went in... to the clean side.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.570
David Boder: From where was your hair cut off?

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:39.536
Jola Gross: From all over.

00:11:39.536 --> 00:11:40.218
David Boder: From the head, too.?

00:11:40.218 --> 00:11:41.154
Jola Gross: From the head, too.

00:11:41.154 --> 00:11:42.108
David Boder: From the head...

00:11:42.108 --> 00:11:42.518
Jola Gross: Yes.

00:11:42.518 --> 00:11:43.110
David Boder: ... and from the body?

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.671
Jola Gross: Also.

00:11:43.671 --> 00:11:45.319
David Boder: And who did it, men...

00:11:45.319 --> 00:11:46.876
Jola Gross: Men and women.

00:11:46.876 --> 00:11:49.713
David Boder: With what did they cut off the hair?

00:11:49.713 --> 00:11:53.594
Jola Gross: With scissors and with things, too, with...

00:11:53.594 --> 00:11:54.349
David Boder: What?

00:11:54.349 --> 00:11:55.212
Jola Gross: Such...

00:11:55.212 --> 00:11:56.148
David Boder: Electric clippers?

00:11:56.148 --> 00:11:57.041
Jola Gross: No, no, no.

00:11:57.041 --> 00:11:58.068
David Boder: With knives [razors]?

00:11:58.068 --> 00:11:58.629
Jola Gross: No.

00:11:58.629 --> 00:11:59.764
David Boder: With razors?

00:11:59.764 --> 00:12:02.106
Jola Gross: With... with machines.

00:12:02.106 --> 00:12:02.969
David Boder: Yes, with machines.

00:12:02.969 --> 00:12:04.508
Jola Gross: With machines and with...

00:12:04.508 --> 00:12:04.858
David Boder: Scissors?

00:12:04.858 --> 00:12:05.220
Jola Gross: Scissors.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:05.914
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:05.914 --> 00:12:18.125
Jola Gross: And then we bathed, and we went over to the clean side. We received our clothes, a dress, and we went out. We were led into the block.

00:12:18.125 --> 00:12:18.457
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:18.457 --> 00:12:22.411
Jola Gross: We were in the block, thirteen hundred people.

00:12:22.411 --> 00:12:22.840
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.576
Jola Gross: In one block.

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:24.741
David Boder: Only women?

00:12:24.741 --> 00:12:29.377
Jola Gross: Only women. It was in the women’s concentration camp — FK... F...

00:12:29.377 --> 00:12:34.556
David Boder: Now well me, were you with... where was your family? Where was your family?

00:12:34.556 --> 00:12:35.268
Jola Gross: Mine?

00:12:35.268 --> 00:12:35.799
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:35.799 --> 00:12:36.783
Jola Gross: A brother...

00:12:36.783 --> 00:12:37.103
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:37.103 --> 00:12:43.399
Jola Gross: ... I had, and sisters, and sisters’ children. They were.... The brother was also [taken] for work.

00:12:43.399 --> 00:12:43.840
David Boder: Yes?

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:52.037
Jola Gross: Because in the bath we saw each other from afar, but the sisters with the children went to the right and were burned.

00:12:52.037 --> 00:12:55.405
David Boder: Yes? [Pause.] Yes?

00:12:55.405 --> 00:13:05.244
Jola Gross: Oh. Then we got into the block, and there we were, thirteen hundred in a block. Well, that I have already told.

00:13:05.244 --> 00:13:05.969
David Boder: Yes?

00:13:05.969 --> 00:13:10.454
Jola Gross: and we slept twelve on one bed.

00:13:10.454 --> 00:13:12.223
David Boder: What does it mean, ‘on one bed’?

00:13:12.223 --> 00:13:18.549
Jola Gross: Thus. It was such a big... two beds were there, but not beds like ours.

00:13:18.549 --> 00:13:19.110
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:21.120
Jola Gross: But in [at] the wall. They were those beds.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.402
David Boder: Yes. Such... such plank-beds.

00:13:23.402 --> 00:13:28.611
Jola Gross: Yes. On the wall, and there we were twelve on one bed.

00:13:28.611 --> 00:13:29.366
David Boder: Sleeping.

00:13:29.366 --> 00:13:30.803
Jola Gross: Sleeping.

00:13:30.803 --> 00:13:31.696
David Boder: Yes. And?

00:13:31.696 --> 00:13:37.883
Jola Gross: And then we also received soup and twenty or twenty-five dekas of bread every day.

00:13:37.883 --> 00:13:38.336
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:38.336 --> 00:13:42.247
Jola Gross: We were there six weeks.

00:13:42.247 --> 00:13:42.942
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:42.942 --> 00:13:43.896
Jola Gross: After six weeks we were...

00:13:43.896 --> 00:13:44.880
David Boder: Did you work there?

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:45.834
Jola Gross: No, no.

00:13:45.834 --> 00:13:46.124
David Boder: No.

00:13:46.124 --> 00:13:54.261
Jola Gross: We did not work then, but in the morning we got up at three o’clock, and we stood at count-appell.

00:13:54.261 --> 00:13:54.822
David Boder: Yes?

00:13:54.822 --> 00:13:58.160
Jola Gross: It lasted till eight...

00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:58.673
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:58.673 --> 00:14:02.102
Jola Gross: ... in the morning, and then we lay outside all day long.

00:14:02.102 --> 00:14:02.754
David Boder: Yes?

00:14:02.754 --> 00:14:07.752
Jola Gross: And after six weeks we were again given a count-appell...

00:14:07.752 --> 00:14:08.042
David Boder: Hm.

00:14:08.042 --> 00:14:31.390
Jola Gross: ... a special one, and were chosen [selected] to be tattooed. Also the weak were again taken out, and the stronger ones were tattooed and were sent to work-lager ‘B.’ We had been in ‘A’ and now... then we went to lager ‘B.’

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:33.080
David Boder: How were you tattooed?

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.369
Jola Gross: In lager ‘A’... in the bath.

00:14:35.369 --> 00:14:36.323
David Boder: In the bathhouse.

00:14:36.323 --> 00:14:36.794
Jola Gross: In the bathhouse.

00:14:36.794 --> 00:14:38.351
David Boder: How did they do it? With a...

00:14:38.351 --> 00:14:41.732
Jola Gross: With a... with... with a thing.

00:14:41.732 --> 00:14:42.233
David Boder: Needle?

00:14:42.233 --> 00:14:43.338
Jola Gross: No, with a pen.

00:14:43.338 --> 00:14:43.628
David Boder: Pen.

00:14:43.628 --> 00:14:44.733
Jola Gross: Pen.

00:14:44.733 --> 00:14:48.584
David Boder: And how come the pen... the pen went in so deep?

00:14:48.584 --> 00:14:49.399
Jola Gross: Yes.

00:14:49.399 --> 00:14:49.930
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:51.349
Jola Gross: It was painful.

00:14:51.349 --> 00:14:52.303
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:52.303 --> 00:14:52.895
Jola Gross: And then...

00:14:52.895 --> 00:14:54.573
David Boder: And who was doing that, prisoners?

00:14:54.573 --> 00:14:55.497
Jola Gross: Prisoners.

00:14:55.497 --> 00:14:56.239
David Boder: Jewish prisoners?

00:14:56.239 --> 00:14:57.085
Jola Gross: Jewish prisoners.

00:14:57.085 --> 00:15:00.182
David Boder: Yes. Nu, then you went to lager ‘B.’

00:15:00.182 --> 00:15:07.262
Jola Gross: We went to lager ‘B,’ and there we worked. I worked in the outside detail.

00:15:07.262 --> 00:15:08.228
David Boder: What was that?

00:15:08.228 --> 00:15:12.773
Jola Gross: That... that was field [agricultural] work, construction work...

00:15:12.773 --> 00:15:13.105
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:13.105 --> 00:15:16.202
Jola Gross: ... and such other... such as is always...

00:15:16.202 --> 00:15:16.673
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:16.673 --> 00:15:17.687
Jola Gross: ... done outside.

00:15:17.687 --> 00:15:18.683
David Boder: Construction work? What...

00:15:18.683 --> 00:15:19.486
Jola Gross: Construction work...

00:15:19.486 --> 00:15:21.375
David Boder: What did you build, a house?

00:15:21.375 --> 00:15:30.297
Jola Gross: We have... we dismantled the houses, the bricks, and the... the... carried them, and by construction the same thing also...

00:15:30.297 --> 00:15:32.186
David Boder: What houses did you dismantle?

00:15:32.186 --> 00:15:33.484
Jola Gross: Old houses.

00:15:33.484 --> 00:15:33.756
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:33.756 --> 00:15:38.724
Jola Gross: New ones, too. I don’t know [why?]. We went to work outside the wires.

00:15:38.724 --> 00:15:39.285
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:39.285 --> 00:15:44.585
Jola Gross: and we had... then we planted a forest...

00:15:44.585 --> 00:15:45.388
David Boder: Hm.

00:15:45.388 --> 00:15:49.269
Jola Gross: ... and also cut down a forest.

00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.692
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:49.692 --> 00:15:52.034
Jola Gross: It was very hard work, too.

00:15:52.034 --> 00:15:53.422
David Boder: How was it done?

00:15:53.422 --> 00:15:55.824
Jola Gross: In Birkenau. [Wie in German means how; in Yiddish it means where, hence the discrepancies in the answers.]

00:15:55.824 --> 00:15:58.028
David Boder: Is Birkenau near Auschwitz?

00:15:58.028 --> 00:16:02.724
Jola Gross: Birkenau is the main lager of... of...

00:16:02.724 --> 00:16:03.557
David Boder: Auschwitz.

00:16:03.557 --> 00:16:04.299
Jola Gross: Of Auschwitz.

00:16:04.299 --> 00:16:04.709
David Boder: Hm.

00:16:04.709 --> 00:16:06.538
Jola Gross: It was forty square kilometers...

00:16:06.538 --> 00:16:06.828
David Boder: Yes.

00:16:06.828 --> 00:16:07.661
Jola Gross: ... large [in size].

00:16:07.661 --> 00:16:08.041
David Boder: Nu?

00:16:08.041 --> 00:16:14.639
Jola Gross: And we went there every day to work. The band was playing.

00:16:14.639 --> 00:16:17.886
David Boder: What sort of a band was there? Tell me a little more about it.

00:16:17.886 --> 00:16:20.150
Jola Gross: The band was made up of prisoners.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.832
David Boder: Prisoners.

00:16:20.832 --> 00:16:21.043
Jola Gross: Prisoners.

00:16:21.043 --> 00:16:22.130
David Boder: Men or women?

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:25.408
Jola Gross: For the men there were men, and for the women there were women.

00:16:25.408 --> 00:16:26.543
David Boder: Were there women who could play?

00:16:26.543 --> 00:16:36.943
Jola Gross: Women who could play at the... at the gate when we were going out. They stood there on the music place and were playing.

00:16:36.943 --> 00:16:39.207
David Boder: What did the women play?

00:16:39.207 --> 00:16:44.507
Jola Gross: They were only playing a march so that we should march left [in step].

00:16:44.507 --> 00:16:45.008
David Boder: Yes.

00:16:45.008 --> 00:16:47.060
Jola Gross: We had to march left [in step].

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:47.845
David Boder: Aha.

00:16:47.845 --> 00:16:54.744
Jola Gross: And that is how we would go out. Sometimes we would march eight kilometers, ten kilometers on foot to work.

00:16:54.744 --> 00:16:56.103
David Boder: And the band went along?

00:16:56.103 --> 00:17:00.346
Jola Gross: No. They only accompanied us when we went out through the gate.

00:17:00.346 --> 00:17:00.648
David Boder: Yes?

00:17:00.648 --> 00:17:01.421
Jola Gross: And when we returned...

00:17:01.421 --> 00:17:01.892
David Boder: Yes?

00:17:01.892 --> 00:17:08.097
Jola Gross: ... they also sat at the gate and played.

00:17:08.097 --> 00:17:13.017
David Boder: Wait a moment. On what indstruments did they play? You said they were women.

00:17:13.017 --> 00:17:16.596
Jola Gross: Piano... no. On violins.

00:17:16.596 --> 00:17:17.188
David Boder: Violins?

00:17:17.188 --> 00:17:17.568
Jola Gross: Violins.

00:17:17.568 --> 00:17:18.926
David Boder: And on trumpets?

00:17:18.926 --> 00:17:22.639
Jola Gross: And there was a woman bandmaster.

00:17:22.639 --> 00:17:23.140
David Boder: Yes?

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:24.607
Jola Gross: Yes. All were prisoners.

00:17:24.607 --> 00:17:27.402
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:17:27.402 --> 00:17:32.128
Jola Gross: And coming home in the evening we received the bread...

00:17:32.128 --> 00:17:32.792
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:32.792 --> 00:17:36.716
Jola Gross: ... and went to sleep...

00:17:36.716 --> 00:17:37.247
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:37.247 --> 00:17:39.197
Jola Gross: ... and [words not clear].

00:17:39.197 --> 00:17:40.060
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:18:19.769
Jola Gross: Once we were returning from work. We saw a truck. We saw from afar that the truck is already moving. It was already at night, five months, six months after coming to Birkenau. We saw a truck was coming. We were passing where the two crematories were, and we heard the girls crying in Hungarian, ‘Don’t take us to the crematory. We are still young. We want to live.’ And they were taken to the crematory from the revier [sick-ward].

00:18:19.769 --> 00:18:20.644
David Boder: From where?

00:18:20.644 --> 00:18:21.658
Jola Gross: From the revier.

00:18:21.658 --> 00:18:22.382
David Boder: What is that?

00:18:22.382 --> 00:18:25.629
Jola Gross: Revier is a hospital...

00:18:25.629 --> 00:18:26.341
David Boder: Oh, a hosp-...

00:18:26.341 --> 00:18:27.217
Jola Gross: The sick were there [?].

00:18:27.217 --> 00:18:27.718
David Boder: Yes.

00:18:27.718 --> 00:18:36.941
Jola Gross: That was called a revier. From the revier.they had been... in the afternoon at the count-appell they had been taken out.

00:18:36.941 --> 00:18:37.847
David Boder: Hm.

00:18:37.847 --> 00:18:45.803
Jola Gross: Those who looked bad were... every week or every two weeks there was a selection.

00:18:45.803 --> 00:18:46.213
David Boder: Hm.

00:18:46.213 --> 00:18:47.438
Jola Gross: That means an... an over- [a going over]...

00:18:47.438 --> 00:18:48.283
David Boder: Yes, I understand.

00:18:48.283 --> 00:19:00.283
Jola Gross: A selection, and the names were written down, the... the... the tattoo number, and they were driven away, those who looked bad.

00:19:00.283 --> 00:19:01.520
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:10.683
Jola Gross: And I had a brother who... he worked in the special Kommando.

00:19:10.683 --> 00:19:12.120
David Boder: What is a special Kommando?

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:19.683
Jola Gross: Special Kommando were those who worked at burning the people who were being burned.

00:19:19.683 --> 00:19:21.283
David Boder: And your brother was working there?

00:19:21.283 --> 00:19:20.848
Jola Gross: Worked there, too.

00:19:20.848 --> 00:19:24.802
David Boder: Yes? Nu?

00:19:24.802 --> 00:19:42.627
Jola Gross: He wrote me once a small note that he is working there, and there... and he hopes that perhaps he will come out, but, alas, in September he was burned.

00:19:42.627 --> 00:19:44.154
David Boder: How? Why?

00:19:44.154 --> 00:19:47.884
Jola Gross: Two hundred were picked out from there.

00:19:47.884 --> 00:19:48.488
David Boder: Yes?

00:19:48.488 --> 00:19:52.309
Jola Gross: And they were loaded on wagons [RR-cars].

00:19:52.309 --> 00:19:52.750
David Boder: Yes?

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:56.118
Jola Gross: That means that they have been sent on a transport.

00:19:56.118 --> 00:19:56.571
David Boder: Yes?

00:19:56.571 --> 00:20:06.006
Jola Gross: They were sent from Birkenau as far as Auschwitz. In the wagons they were gasse dand brought back to the crematories to be burned.

00:20:06.006 --> 00:20:08.227
David Boder: Oh, they were gassed in the wagons?

00:20:08.227 --> 00:20:09.103
Jola Gross: In the wagons.

00:20:09.103 --> 00:20:09.845
David Boder: Why were they...

00:20:09.845 --> 00:20:15.628
Jola Gross: They were treated specially different because they knew what was being done to the other thousands of people.

00:20:15.628 --> 00:20:16.099
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:16.099 --> 00:20:18.803
Jola Gross: With them it was done differently

00:20:18.803 --> 00:20:19.226
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:19.226 --> 00:20:22.413
Jola Gross: They were sent away. It was called on a transport.

00:20:22.413 --> 00:20:22.866
David Boder: Yes?

00:20:22.866 --> 00:20:27.321
Jola Gross: They left Birkenau in the transport, and in the wagons they were...

00:20:27.321 --> 00:20:27.973
David Boder: Gassed.

00:20:27.973 --> 00:20:28.565
Jola Gross: Gassed.

00:20:28.565 --> 00:20:29.862
Jola Gross: Gassed, and they were...

00:20:29.862 --> 00:20:30.725
David Boder: Brought back.

00:20:30.725 --> 00:20:32.596
Jola Gross: ... brought back, burned.

00:20:32.596 --> 00:20:34.908
David Boder: Nu? And your brother was among them.

00:20:34.908 --> 00:20:35.892
Jola Gross: Was there.

00:20:35.892 --> 00:20:37.570
David Boder: How did you find it out?

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:54.894
Jola Gross: There had remained of those... eight hundred men were working there in the special Kommando. A few Polish [Polish Jews?] remained, and in Sept-... in November...

00:20:54.894 --> 00:20:55.286
David Boder: Yes?

00:20:55.286 --> 00:20:58.111
Jola Gross: ... the crematories were dismantled.

00:20:58.111 --> 00:20:58.763
David Boder: Why?

00:20:58.763 --> 00:21:08.054
Jola Gross: Because they didn’t want the... because they knew that the Russians were approaching. They shouldn’t see what there...

00:21:08.054 --> 00:21:08.530
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:12.532
Jola Gross: ... what was done there. I was working there.

00:21:12.532 --> 00:21:14.011
David Boder: Where did you work? At the crematories?

00:21:14.011 --> 00:21:16.806
Jola Gross: At the crematories when they were... eh...

00:21:16.806 --> 00:21:17.699
David Boder: Dismantled.

00:21:17.699 --> 00:21:24.852
Jola Gross: ... dismantled. There were men who had remained. They told me what happened that time...

00:21:24.852 --> 00:21:25.245
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:25.245 --> 00:21:28.945
Jola Gross: ... with those people, and that my brother, too, was among them.

00:21:28.945 --> 00:21:31.511
David Boder: And then after the crematories were dismantled...

00:21:31.511 --> 00:21:31.831
Jola Gross: Yes.

00:21:31.831 --> 00:21:34.596
David Boder: ... were people still being gassed?

00:21:34.596 --> 00:21:45.117
Jola Gross: No. At the end of November they did not... they did not burn any more.

00:21:45.117 --> 00:21:45.992
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:45.992 --> 00:21:53.012
Jola Gross: They were all... there were four crematories. Only one remained to burn the dead.

00:21:53.012 --> 00:21:58.233
David Boder: Yes. Nu? What happened then?

00:21:58.233 --> 00:21:59.622
Jola Gross: What more?

00:21:59.622 --> 00:22:02.900
David Boder: What happened afterwards? How were you liberated?

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:12.486
Jola Gross: I was liberated, because on the 15th of January I went on a transport to Sudeten Germany, to a factory...

00:22:12.486 --> 00:22:13.138
David Boder: Yes?

00:22:13.138 --> 00:22:14.031
Jola Gross: ... to work.

00:22:14.031 --> 00:22:18.287
David Boder: What year was that? [Pause.] In what year was that?

00:22:18.287 --> 00:22:19.361
Jola Gross: In...

00:22:19.361 --> 00:22:20.357
David Boder: ’45.

00:22:20.357 --> 00:22:20.918
Jola Gross: In ’45.

00:22:20.918 --> 00:22:21.462
David Boder: Yes?

00:22:21.462 --> 00:22:25.464
Jola Gross: In the year ’45 I went there.

00:22:25.464 --> 00:22:25.947
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:25.947 --> 00:22:34.687
Jola Gross: And there I was until the place was evacuated. From there we were evacuated without food, and I was...

00:22:34.687 --> 00:22:35.623
David Boder: Where to?

00:22:35.623 --> 00:22:38.388
Jola Gross: To... farther into Germany.

00:22:38.388 --> 00:22:38.949
David Boder: Yes?

00:22:38.949 --> 00:22:41.321
Jola Gross: And I remained behind.

00:22:41.321 --> 00:22:43.011
David Boder: In Sudeten?

00:22:43.011 --> 00:22:52.929
Jola Gross: Yes. I did not want to go on any more. I had... I was very sick. I had swollen feet, and I remained behind. Then the Russians came.

00:22:52.929 --> 00:22:53.581
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:53.581 --> 00:22:54.746
Jola Gross: And we were liberated.

00:22:54.746 --> 00:22:55.639
David Boder: You were liberated.

00:22:55.639 --> 00:22:56.152
Jola Gross: Yes.

00:22:56.152 --> 00:22:59.731
David Boder: How did you then come to Paris?

00:22:59.731 --> 00:23:04.591
Jola Gross: To Paris I... I went to Germany. There I was...

00:23:04.591 --> 00:23:07.386
David Boder: How? Where did the Russians liberate you? In the Sudenten?

00:23:07.386 --> 00:23:08.279
Jola Gross: In the Sudeten.

00:23:08.279 --> 00:23:11.297
David Boder: All right. how did you get away from Sudeten?

00:23:11.297 --> 00:23:12.776
Jola Gross: I went to Germany.

00:23:12.776 --> 00:23:13.772
David Boder: Why?

00:23:13.772 --> 00:23:25.271
Jola Gross: Because I wanted to leave. I didn’t want to remain any more where my people were slaughtered in blood. Because I want to go to Palestine.

00:23:25.271 --> 00:23:29.044
David Boder: Did the Russians allow you to leave, or did you run away?

00:23:29.044 --> 00:23:33.559
Jola Gross: No. We continued. We traveled.

00:23:33.559 --> 00:23:34.042
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:34.042 --> 00:23:35.931
Jola Gross: We went in May to Prague. Then we went...

00:23:35.931 --> 00:23:37.036
David Boder: Then you went to Germany.

00:23:37.036 --> 00:23:38.261
Jola Gross: To Germany.

00:23:38.261 --> 00:23:39.318
David Boder: And from Germany?

00:23:39.318 --> 00:23:44.075
Jola Gross: From Germany I went to Paris, because I want to go to Palestine.

00:23:44.075 --> 00:23:46.477
David Boder: You traveled free [without a ticket]? You traveled free towards Palestine?

00:23:46.477 --> 00:23:47.111
Jola Gross: Yes.

00:23:47.111 --> 00:23:49.181
David Boder: Yes. Did you have any money?

00:23:49.181 --> 00:23:49.821
Jola Gross: No.

00:23:49.821 --> 00:23:51.572
David Boder: So how did you travel?

00:23:51.572 --> 00:23:52.805
Jola Gross: Without money.

00:23:52.805 --> 00:23:56.916
David Boder: All right. And why... you are thirty-six years old?

00:23:56.916 --> 00:23:57.510
Jola Gross: Yes.

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:00.908
David Boder: Were you always a Zionist... a Zionist.

00:24:00.908 --> 00:24:01.845
Jola Gross: Yes.

00:24:01.845 --> 00:24:05.986
David Boder: And what do you want to do in Palestine?

00:24:05.986 --> 00:24:05.986
Jola Gross: Work.

00:24:05.986 --> 00:24:06.898
David Boder: Hm.

00:24:06.898 --> 00:24:22.218
Jola Gross: I don’t want to remain any more in such countries where one has endured such things that we saw, that we suffered, and that I reel.... I want to be already home in Palestine.

00:24:22.218 --> 00:24:26.281
David Boder: Why do you say ‘home in Palestine’? Do you have relatives there?

00:24:26.281 --> 00:24:31.359
Jola Gross: No, I have none. There is my home. I am a Jew.

00:24:31.359 --> 00:24:34.456
David Boder: And therefore Palestine is your home?

00:24:34.456 --> 00:24:37.534
Jola Gross: [Laughing:] I think so. Where else? [A long pause.]

00:24:37.534 --> 00:24:52.733
David Boder: Yes. Tell me, to whom did you come to Paris? Nu, yes, you...

00:24:52.733 --> 00:24:53.577
Jola Gross: I was...

00:24:53.577 --> 00:24:56.281
David Boder: Were you permitted to enter France?

00:24:56.281 --> 00:24:57.368
Jola Gross: Yes.

00:24:57.368 --> 00:24:57.368
David Boder: How...

00:24:57.368 --> 00:24:57.869
Jola Gross: Illegally.

00:24:57.869 --> 00:25:01.177
David Boder: Illegally. How did you cross the border?

00:25:01.177 --> 00:25:05.270
Jola Gross: Nu, difficult [I managed]. I crossed the border...

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:06.797
David Boder: From where? From Germany or from...

00:25:06.797 --> 00:25:07.763
Jola Gross: From Germany.

00:25:07.763 --> 00:25:09.381
David Boder: From Germany you came...

00:25:09.381 --> 00:25:09.550
Jola Gross: Yes.

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:10.021
David Boder: ... to France.

00:25:10.021 --> 00:25:10.552
Jola Gross: To France.

00:25:10.552 --> 00:25:13.027
David Boder: And then? How did you come to Paris?

00:25:13.027 --> 00:25:20.482
Jola Gross: In Paris I came here in the... in the home [shelter] of the... eh... what is it called, the...

00:25:20.482 --> 00:25:22.643
David Boder: What is the name of this home? What is it? Who...

00:25:22.643 --> 00:25:23.536
Jola Gross: That is of...

00:25:23.536 --> 00:25:24.520
David Boder: The Jewish Committee?

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.289
Jola Gross: The Jewish Committee, yes.

00:25:26.289 --> 00:25:29.235
David Boder: And what do you do here all day?

00:25:29.235 --> 00:25:31.366
Jola Gross: What?

00:25:31.366 --> 00:25:32.803
David Boder: Yes?

00:25:32.803 --> 00:25:37.952
Jola Gross: I work. I have.... I can sew.

00:25:37.952 --> 00:25:38.906
David Boder: You can sew?

00:25:38.906 --> 00:25:39.890
Jola Gross: Sew, yes.

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:40.693
David Boder: So then...

00:25:40.693 --> 00:25:44.725
Jola Gross: I have to work till I am able to leave for Palestine.

00:25:44.725 --> 00:25:46.101
David Boder: You can sew?

00:25:46.101 --> 00:25:46.373
Jola Gross: Yes.

00:25:46.373 --> 00:25:47.930
David Boder: Do you earn any money?

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:49.470
Jola Gross: So far not.

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:50.892
David Boder: Why not?

00:25:50.892 --> 00:25:52.812
Jola Gross: No, I have no machine...

00:25:52.812 --> 00:25:53.344
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:53.344 --> 00:25:59.097
Jola Gross: ... and no papers, residence papers [permit]. As long as I don’t have it, then...

00:25:59.097 --> 00:26:00.775
David Boder: Oh, you are not permitted to work.

00:26:00.775 --> 00:26:01.499
Jola Gross: No, can not work.

00:26:01.499 --> 00:26:10.813
David Boder: Can’t you do a little private work without a residence permit? If you had a machine could you not work a little by yourself?

00:26:10.813 --> 00:26:13.155
Jola Gross: Yes, but I don’t have a machine.

00:26:13.155 --> 00:26:17.264
David Boder: Yes. And by hand you can’t do much sewing.

00:26:17.264 --> 00:26:18.670
Jola Gross: No. It doesn’t go that way.

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:19.262
David Boder: It doesn’t go that way.

00:26:19.262 --> 00:26:23.837
Jola Gross: [Laughing:] It must be done with precision [accurately] if one wants to earn money.

00:26:23.837 --> 00:26:27.884
David Boder: Yes. Tell me this, at home... how large was your family?

00:26:27.884 --> 00:26:35.870
Jola Gross: We went twelve of our family to Auschwitz. Two of us came back.

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:37.186
David Boder: Who is the other one?

00:26:37.186 --> 00:26:38.000
Jola Gross: A sister.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.829
David Boder: Is she here in Paris with you?
