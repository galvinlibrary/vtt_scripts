00:00:01.087 --> 00:00:36.160
David Boder: [In English] This is Spool 43 taken from Mr. Henry Sochami, 38 years old, tattoo number 109752 triangle, meaning Jewish, a tattoo of the camp of Auschwitz. He will speak Spanish, he can speak German but it’s rather...slow, and we prefer to use the language he can speak most fluently.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:44.492
David Boder: [In Spanish] Er...Mr. Sochami, tell me where you were born, and what your nationality is.

00:00:44.492 --> 00:00:50.335
Henry Sochami: I am Greek.

00:00:50.335 --> 00:00:53.504
David Boder: Right. And where were you born?

00:00:53.504 --> 00:00:54.682
Henry Sochami: In Salonica.

00:00:54.682 --> 00:00:55.485
David Boder: Right.

00:00:55.485 --> 00:00:57.676
Henry Sochami: We were later deported...

00:00:57.676 --> 00:01:11.982
David Boder: Er...I would like you to tell me where you were when the Germans arrived, er...in the city where you resided.

00:01:11.982 --> 00:01:17.282
Henry Sochami: Before the arrival of the Germans, I was in Albany, acting as a Greek soldier.

00:01:17.282 --> 00:01:23.759
David Boder: So you were in the Greek Army. And who were you fighting against?

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.347
Henry Sochami: Against Italy.

00:01:25.347 --> 00:01:30.224
David Boder: All right. Greece joined forces with England and the United States...

00:01:30.224 --> 00:01:31.311
Henry Sochami: The United States, yes.

00:01:31.311 --> 00:01:36.007
David Boder: So you were fighting against Italy. And, what happened?

00:01:36.007 --> 00:01:40.112
Henry Sochami: I was eight months in combat.

00:01:40.112 --> 00:01:44.959
David Boder: In what force were you enlisted?

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:46.770
Henry Sochami: I was in class 19...

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.384
David Boder: No, no. What force did you belong to? Infantry...

00:01:49.384 --> 00:01:55.831
Henry Sochami: Oh, the name was [unintelligible] télégraphiqué?.

00:01:55.831 --> 00:01:58.928
David Boder: Oh! You were in...[unintelligible]?

00:01:58.928 --> 00:01:59.278
Henry Sochami: [unintelligible]

00:01:59.278 --> 00:02:00.968
David Boder: And you know [unintelligible]?

00:02:00.968 --> 00:02:01.451
Henry Sochami: No.

00:02:01.451 --> 00:02:01.904
David Boder: You don’t?

00:02:01.904 --> 00:02:03.944
Henry Sochami: I played the clairon.

00:02:03.944 --> 00:02:04.880
David Boder: Oh, good

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.290
Henry Sochami: I played the bugle.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:16.186
David Boder: So, You were the...er...clarinetist in...er...a telegraphic station.

00:02:16.186 --> 00:02:18.739
Henry Sochami: Yes. Télégraphiqué?.

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.478
David Boder: So, could we say you are a musician?

00:02:20.478 --> 00:02:20.858
Henry Sochami: Yes.

00:02:20.858 --> 00:02:23.001
David Boder: Er...What instruments do you play?

00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:24.057
Henry Sochami: The bugle.

00:02:24.057 --> 00:02:26.261
David Boder: So you play the bugle.

00:02:26.261 --> 00:02:32.949
Henry Sochami: Then. When the Germans declared the war against Greece.

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:33.704
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:33.704 --> 00:02:38.038
Henry Sochami: I was fighting in Albany against Italians.

00:02:38.038 --> 00:02:39.275
David Boder: Right.

00:02:39.275 --> 00:03:00.716
Henry Sochami: Then, when my city...Salonica, was occupied by Germans, we fought in Athens, and all the places of the Old Greece. Later, we were forced to surrender to the German forces, and Germans escorted us to our houses.

00:03:00.716 --> 00:03:02.225
David Boder: Right.

00:03:02.225 --> 00:03:05.817
Henry Sochami: I went to my house and took my three children.

00:03:05.817 --> 00:03:06.982
David Boder: What was the name of the city?

00:03:06.982 --> 00:03:07.845
Henry Sochami: It was Salonica.

00:03:07.845 --> 00:03:10.441
David Boder: Salonica. And were you with your wife?

00:03:10.441 --> 00:03:10.851
Henry Sochami: Yes.

00:03:10.851 --> 00:03:14.141
David Boder: Your wife and three children. How old were they?

00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:24.644
Henry Sochami: One was 13 years old, [unintelligible name] Sochami; the second one was 10 years old, [unintelligible name] Sochami; and the third one, Dora Sochami, was only 3 years old.

00:03:24.644 --> 00:03:25.761
David Boder: OK.

00:03:25.761 --> 00:03:33.083
Henry Sochami: Then, when the Germans arrived, they took all the Jews and sent us to a camp...

00:03:33.083 --> 00:03:34.580
David Boder: Yes. To Auschwitz?

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:45.802
Henry Sochami: No, no. Before that. We were taken to a labor camp. Those of us between 17 and 45 years of age.

00:03:45.802 --> 00:03:47.178
David Boder: Men and Women?

00:03:47.178 --> 00:03:54.277
Henry Sochami: No, just men. Our names were written down, and we were given some signs. We were called by [unintelligible]. 3:50

00:03:54.277 --> 00:03:54.639
David Boder: Aha.

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:58.442
Henry Sochami: Shared. And we had to work.

00:03:58.442 --> 00:03:59.227
David Boder: Aha.

00:03:59.227 --> 00:04:06.398
Henry Sochami: After working there, we were taken to...er...some railways...to guard them.

00:04:06.398 --> 00:04:07.364
David Boder: Aha.

00:04:07.364 --> 00:04:12.392
Henry Sochami: After that, we were taken to a ghetto in [unintelligible]

00:04:12.392 --> 00:04:13.599
David Boder: Where?

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.624
Henry Sochami: In [unintelligible], in Greece. The train station.

00:04:16.624 --> 00:04:16.956
David Boder: OK.

00:04:16.956 --> 00:04:20.789
Henry Sochami: We were locked in the ghetto and we remained there for eight days.

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:21.363
David Boder: Aha.

00:04:21.363 --> 00:04:27.297
Henry Sochami: After those eight days, three thousand five hundred people were sent...

00:04:27.297 --> 00:04:28.915
David Boder: Men and women?

00:04:28.915 --> 00:04:30.563
Henry Sochami: Men, women, and children.

00:04:30.563 --> 00:04:31.275
David Boder: Right.

00:04:31.275 --> 00:04:33.388
Henry Sochami: We were sent in closed railway cars.

00:04:33.388 --> 00:04:41.694
David Boder: So. As you were saying, you worked only with men...So where were your wife and the girls?

00:04:41.694 --> 00:04:48.093
Henry Sochami: When we left Salonica, it was March 15, 1943.

00:04:48.093 --> 00:04:49.318
David Boder: Who were you with?

00:04:49.318 --> 00:04:52.004
Henry Sochami: We were with the [unintelligible family name].

00:04:52.004 --> 00:04:52.789
David Boder: So you knew this family, right?

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:54.962
Henry Sochami: Yes. We arrived in Auschwitz. We got to the station on March 21.

00:04:54.962 --> 00:04:56.006
David Boder: Right.

00:04:56.006 --> 00:05:14.502
Henry Sochami: There was a selection there...er...some German officers separated children, women and old people from those who could work.

00:05:14.502 --> 00:05:15.214
David Boder: Right.

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:22.277
Henry Sochami: Children, women and old people were placed in trucks and sent to Birkenau.

00:05:22.277 --> 00:05:22.796
David Boder: To Birkenau?

00:05:22.796 --> 00:05:35.328
Henry Sochami: Yes, Birkenau. Once there, they were sent to the gas chamber, directly...almost with no difficulties. The following morning, none of them were alive.

00:05:35.328 --> 00:05:37.308
David Boder: Did this happen to your family?

00:05:37.308 --> 00:05:42.849
Henry Sochami: Yes. To all my family: three children and my wife.

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:43.453
David Boder: Oh.

00:05:43.453 --> 00:05:49.266
Henry Sochami: We were then sent to Auschwitz. Once in Auschwitz, we were left in the bathrooms all night long.

00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:49.797
David Boder: Oh.

00:05:49.797 --> 00:05:59.002
Henry Sochami: We were washed, our clothes were taken away, we were given prisoner’s clothes, and we were placed under quarantine for forty days.

00:05:59.002 --> 00:06:00.994
David Boder: What did you do while you were in quarantine?

00:06:00.994 --> 00:06:05.733
Henry Sochami: During the quarantine period, we were taken outside to do some physical exercise...and that was it.

00:06:05.733 --> 00:06:06.807
David Boder: OK.

00:06:06.807 --> 00:06:20.570
Henry Sochami: After the forty days had passed, some officers came to see us. They selected all those men who were strong and working men, and sent them out of Auschwitz, to other labor camps. I stayed in Auschwitz.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.377
David Boder: What happened to those who could not work?

00:06:23.377 --> 00:06:31.303
Henry Sochami: Those who could not work were taken to a hospital...er...from the hospital, they were taken to Birkenau, to the crematorium.

00:06:31.303 --> 00:06:31.834
David Boder: Right.

00:06:31.834 --> 00:06:38.263
Henry Sochami: And as for those of us who could work, we were sent to labor camps or commands nearby.

00:06:38.263 --> 00:06:38.945
David Boder: Aha.

00:06:38.945 --> 00:06:49.768
Henry Sochami: In the commands...we were left aside, beaten...And our food was a piece of bread with a liter of water.

00:06:49.768 --> 00:06:51.971
David Boder: What command did you work in?

00:06:51.971 --> 00:06:53.843
Henry Sochami: In the [unintelligible]

00:06:53.843 --> 00:06:55.521
David Boder: And what did you do there?

00:06:55.521 --> 00:06:58.516
Henry Sochami: There, we practiced masonry.

00:06:58.516 --> 00:07:01.009
David Boder: Oh, you cut stone blocks?

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:10.263
Henry Sochami: Yes. Stones...with civilians who worked with us.

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:15.985
David Boder: There was a little interruption.

00:07:15.985 --> 00:07:27.726
Henry Sochami: A month before the Russians’ arrival, the camp was evacuated and we were sent to a camp in [unintelligible name]. In [unintelligible name], there were only forty Jews, and the rest of the prisoners were Christian.

00:07:27.726 --> 00:07:29.887
David Boder: Could you please speak a little bit slower?

00:07:29.887 --> 00:07:55.608
Henry Sochami: Christians battered us because they could not stand the mere sight of us. They would walk away from us, they would beat us, and they would even take our bread which was our only food. From there, before the Russians came, we were taken to Buchenwald. We were forced in cattle railcars and we were locked there for three days and three nights, with no food and nothing to drink. Nothing.

00:07:55.608 --> 00:07:57.962
David Boder: Do you remember what month it was?

00:07:57.962 --> 00:08:03.033
Henry Sochami: Er...It was February of 1945.

00:08:03.033 --> 00:08:07.035
David Boder: February of 1945. All right.

00:08:07.035 --> 00:08:38.126
Henry Sochami: We were taken to Buchenwald. There were sixty five to seventy thousand people under the same roof, from all nationalities, French, Italians...all the nationalities in the world. We were in a building for some time, and then there was a selection and all those who were strong enough were taken to camps all around Germany for forced labors. I would always hid under beds, or anywhere to avoid being taken to labor camps.

00:08:38.126 --> 00:08:48.195
David Boder: Oh! So it was possible to hide sometimes, wasn’t it?

00:08:48.195 --> 00:09:32.930
Henry Sochami: It was sometimes possible. From there, I was taken to a small camp. In that small camp, I was in a barrack hut with 1,200-1,300 people. There were 7 or 8 people per square meter. At ten in the morning, we were given a liter of water and a piece of bread. Three months later, Americans were approaching and every afternoon Jews were gathered to be taken away. Christians were not taken away, but Jews were. I would hide anywhere, and I even lived among Christians and they did not know I was a Jew.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:38.001
David Boder: Did you carry anything that distinguished you as Jews?

00:09:38.001 --> 00:09:43.784
Henry Sochami: In Auschwitz, we carried a sign as Jews, but when we were in Buchenwald we did not have anything.

00:09:43.784 --> 00:09:44.677
David Boder: OK.

00:09:44.677 --> 00:09:45.673
Henry Sochami: There were no differences among us.

00:09:45.673 --> 00:09:46.699
David Boder: Aha.

00:09:46.699 --> 00:10:09.831
Henry Sochami: Jews that were taken away from this place, were killed down the road with submachine guns. I was able to hid for three days under ground, in a barrack, together with many Russian Christians, who did not know I was a Jew.

00:10:09.831 --> 00:10:10.875
David Boder: They didn’t know you.

00:10:10.875 --> 00:10:15.704
Henry Sochami: They didn’t know if I was a Jew. I always told them I was Greek and Christian.

00:10:15.704 --> 00:10:17.757
David Boder: Greek and Christian, I see.

00:10:17.757 --> 00:10:34.526
Henry Sochami: Then, a couple of days before the Germans left, the Americans arrived. It was about four in the afternoon, in April; April 11, 1945.

00:10:34.526 --> 00:10:35.268
David Boder: Right.

00:10:35.268 --> 00:10:41.456
Henry Sochami: When I saw the Russians coming out, because we had been hiding, I did not want to go out because I was scared.

00:10:41.456 --> 00:10:42.229
David Boder: Right.

00:10:42.229 --> 00:11:05.969
Henry Sochami: Then I saw they were all kissing and embracing each other outside. I looked and I saw everybody was dancing because the Americans were coming, so I went out. I weighted only 38 kg because of the famine, and though I was falling down, I started singing and dancing.

00:11:05.969 --> 00:11:07.200
David Boder: Right.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:14.866
Henry Sochami: Once the Americans arrived, we started eating and drinking well, and I was with the Americans for two months.

00:11:14.866 --> 00:11:15.681
David Boder: Where?

00:11:15.681 --> 00:11:17.009
Henry Sochami: In Buchenwald.

00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:18.790
David Boder: Buchenwald. I see.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:23.184
Henry Sochami: After two months, we were sent to Paris to be taken to Greece.

00:11:23.184 --> 00:11:23.999
David Boder: Right.

00:11:23.999 --> 00:11:25.418
Henry Sochami: By plane.

00:11:25.418 --> 00:11:27.006
David Boder: Aha.

00:11:27.006 --> 00:11:27.899
Henry Sochami: [Unintelligible]

00:11:27.899 --> 00:11:29.710
David Boder: How many people were there on the plane?

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:32.185
Henry Sochami: Only 53 Greek.

00:11:32.185 --> 00:11:33.060
David Boder: Aha.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.388
Henry Sochami: And 10 from Salonica.

00:11:34.388 --> 00:11:35.294
David Boder: Aha.

00:11:35.294 --> 00:11:47.626
Henry Sochami: We were taken to Paris, and the rest were sent to Greece. And since I had served in the French Légion Étrangère from 1920 to 1925, in Morocco...

00:11:47.626 --> 00:11:49.063
David Boder: Oh. Right. Aha.

00:11:49.063 --> 00:11:53.367
Henry Sochami: I had the chance of staying in France.

00:11:53.367 --> 00:11:54.683
David Boder: Aha.

00:11:54.683 --> 00:12:03.242
Henry Sochami: And so I stayed like this for a year because I was really thin.

00:12:03.242 --> 00:12:03.725
David Boder: Aha.

00:12:03.725 --> 00:12:06.351
Henry Sochami: And now, I have started to work.

00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:08.977
David Boder: And who do you work for now?

00:12:08.977 --> 00:12:10.504
Henry Sochami: For an American journal.

00:12:10.504 --> 00:12:16.239
David Boder: OK. And what are you planning to do in the future?

00:12:16.239 --> 00:12:26.941
Henry Sochami: I don’t know...For the time being, I am working here, and as soon as I can find another job to earn my living.

00:12:26.941 --> 00:12:30.140
David Boder: Aha. But, are you planning to stay in France?

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:30.774
Henry Sochami: Yes.

00:12:30.774 --> 00:12:31.167
David Boder: And...

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:34.746
Henry Sochami: May be I will go to Palestine later.

00:12:34.746 --> 00:12:35.350
David Boder: Aha.

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.519
Henry Sochami: And...as soon as the situation improves.

00:12:38.519 --> 00:12:43.590
David Boder: Aha. And what do you do here for the journal? What are you doing now?

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:51.817
Henry Sochami: I work here in the [unintelligible], Where they receive heavy boxes. I carry them, I close envelopes...er...

00:12:51.817 --> 00:12:53.719
David Boder: So you do manual work.

00:12:53.719 --> 00:12:54.854
Henry Sochami: Yes. Manual work.

00:12:54.854 --> 00:12:58.252
David Boder: Do you have family here?

00:12:58.252 --> 00:13:13.554
Henry Sochami: Unfortunately, there were 27 members in my family: 3 brothers, one sister with their own families. And they all ended up in [crematories?], and I am the only one left in my whole family.

00:13:13.554 --> 00:13:13.886
David Boder: Aha.

00:13:13.886 --> 00:13:16.240
Henry Sochami: Out of 27, I am alone in the world.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.827
David Boder: And have you written to Greece?

00:13:36.655 --> 00:13:53.786
Henry Sochami: And one of my sister’s daughters...people say they saw her alive with other girls...but she left with some Belgians, and I have no idea whether she is dead or alive...I don’t know where she is...I was told she was sent to Belgium.

00:13:53.786 --> 00:13:55.977

00:14:08.683 --> 00:14:30.213
David Boder: [In English] That ends the report of Henry Sochami. Taking about...taking about twelve minutes of Spool number 43. We will leave the rest for another interviewee. Thank you very much.
