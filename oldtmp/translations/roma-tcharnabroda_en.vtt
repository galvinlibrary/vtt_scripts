00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:41.941
David Boder: [In English] Munich, September the 24th, at Deutsches Museum, the UNRRA University. We are going to interview now a Polish-Jewish girl, a student, Miss Roma Tcharna—...Tcharnabroda, of whom...who has lost both of her legs in a concentration camp. That is, she suffered from frozen legs, and they were amputated three days after the Americans came to liberate them. We are going to...I am passing the microphone to Roma.

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:45.240
David Boder: [In German]...and so Miss, it is Miss or Mrs?

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.857
Roma Tcharnabroda: Mrs.

00:00:47.857 --> 00:00:47.388
David Boder: Is your husband here?

00:00:47.388 --> 00:00:48.693
Roma Tcharnabroda: Lost

00:00:48.693 --> 00:00:50.334
David Boder: You have lost your husband, you are then a widow.

00:00:50.334 --> 00:00:50.788
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes.

00:00:50.788 --> 00:00:58.738
David Boder: Now then Mrs. Tcharnabroda, will you please tell me where you were, and what happened to you when the war started.

00:00:58.738 --> 00:01:10.248
Roma Tcharnabroda: In 1939 I was in Poland. Then when the Germans approached, my husband was subject to the draft and was a physician. So he was called to service.

00:01:10.248 --> 00:01:11.829
David Boder: In what city of Poland were you?

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:12.901
Roma Tcharnabroda: Kielce.

00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:13.703
David Boder: Kielce?

00:01:13.703 --> 00:01:14.040
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.755
David Boder: Is this the city where they recently had the pogrom?

00:01:15.755 --> 00:01:16.258
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes

00:01:16.258 --> 00:01:17.689
David Boder: Now go on

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:34.486
Roma Tcharnabroda: go on...Then my husband...he had to go with the army. However he was not enlisted, but received orders to, to move on eastward. I, as a “sister,” because in the gymnasium we also completed courses...

00:01:34.486 --> 00:01:35.951
David Boder: Then you were a nurse, a...

00:01:35.951 --> 00:01:38.664
Roma Tcharnabroda: No, my training was only from the gymnasium, what we completed in the gymnasium...

00:01:38.664 --> 00:01:40.219
David Boder: but as a nurse

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:42.213
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes, but one of those who are being called in emergency.

00:01:42.213 --> 00:01:44.277
David Boder: Yes. A kind of nurses aid

00:01:44.277 --> 00:01:45.131
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes...aids

00:01:45.131 --> 00:01:46.000
David Boder: Yes, [in English] a cadet nurse.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.367
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes

00:01:46.367 --> 00:01:46.843
David Boder: Go on.

00:01:46.843 --> 00:01:51.195
Roma Tcharnabroda: And so we both traveled east, in the eastern direction towards Lemberg.

00:01:51.195 --> 00:01:52.755
David Boder: Do you also speak Yiddish?

00:01:52.755 --> 00:01:53.718
Roma Tcharnabroda: Very badly [laughter]

00:01:53.718 --> 00:01:54.445
David Boder: Then speak German.

00:01:54.445 --> 00:02:11.065
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes. Also in the direction of Rovna. And then from Rovna—the Russians were already there. And then we traveled to Lemberg and from 1939 until 1941 I was under the rule of the Russians—in Lemberg.

00:02:11.065 --> 00:02:11.774
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:11.774 --> 00:02:46.803
Roma Tcharnabroda: In 1941, the Germans arrived in Lemberg. I sat through all the pogroms which took place in Lemberg right from the beginning. That means, from the first day when they arrived, and Brezizky [??] the prison, the famous prison was opened. The Germans have ascertained that there were many corpses, and that the Bolsheviks, before retreating have committed many atrocities, that is they had many...for example have cut off the legs, etc.

00:02:46.803 --> 00:02:46.803
David Boder: And Bolsheviks did that?

00:02:46.803 --> 00:02:51.218
Roma Tcharnabroda: That’s what the Germans said, that Bolksheviks had done that.

00:02:51.218 --> 00:02:51.619
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:51.619 --> 00:03:25.530
Roma Tcharnabroda: But a committee of physicians, of Polish and Ukrainian physicians, who entered together with the Germans the Brezizky prison, made the remarks that the corpses, on the corpses no blood was visible at the cut off limbs. They even observed very “comic” situations, that when a part of the body is cut off from a living [person], blood is visible. But on these people no blood was visible, so apparently that was done after they were dead.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.534
David Boder: And how did the dead get there?

00:03:27.534 --> 00:03:35.059
Roma Tcharnabroda: These were prisoners who were left behind in the prison when the Bolsheviks departed.

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:36.953
David Boder: And then who shot them.

00:03:36.953 --> 00:03:40.035
Roma Tcharnabroda: These were massacred apparently, by the Germans themselves.

00:03:40.035 --> 00:03:47.785
David Boder: If the Germans themselves had massacred them, then they could have cut off the legs and hands immediately, then blood would have been present?

00:03:47.785 --> 00:04:00.662
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes, it is possible that the bombs and the fragments of grenades which fell there, at the time when the Bolsheviks departed, as well as during battle, that [?] could happened.

00:04:00.662 --> 00:04:01.181
David Boder: Yes.

00:04:01.181 --> 00:04:04.802
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes, and so it was perfectly clear that they have arranged it so.

00:04:04.802 --> 00:04:05.079
David Boder: Yes.

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.982
Roma Tcharnabroda: And so, as reprisals, pogroms were perpetrated against the Jews. Naturally.

00:04:09.982 --> 00:04:10.197
David Boder: So.

00:04:10.197 --> 00:04:10.927
Roma Tcharnabroda: The Jews had to pay.

00:04:10.927 --> 00:04:12.262
David Boder: Yes.

00:04:12.262 --> 00:04:12.262
Roma Tcharnabroda: And then took place the first incidents when the Jews were dragged away to Bielsetz. The first extermination camps were then installed. One had no idea

00:04:12.262 --> 00:04:23.372
David Boder: Yes...

00:04:23.372 --> 00:04:24.261
Roma Tcharnabroda: about creamatories.

00:04:24.261 --> 00:04:28.411
David Boder: Now will you please tell me all about what happened to you.

00:04:28.411 --> 00:04:28.579
Roma Tcharnabroda: to me...

00:04:28.579 --> 00:04:29.984
David Boder: . . . to you, what happened to you [a few words not clear]

00:04:29.984 --> 00:04:38.929
Roma Tcharnabroda: Also in 1941 when the Germans arrived I was in a lager of Yanovska street, a labor lager...

00:04:38.929 --> 00:04:41.083
David Boder: You mean the Germans put you...

00:04:41.083 --> 00:04:43.965
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes, drafted for a labor lager...

00:04:43.965 --> 00:04:45.031
David Boder: Yes, and where was your husband?

00:04:45.031 --> 00:04:48.273
Roma Tcharnabroda: My husband too was in Lemberg, and he too was in the labor camp.

00:04:48.273 --> 00:04:48.820
David Boder: Go on...

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.946
Roma Tcharnabroda: Then I...

00:04:49.946 --> 00:04:50.902
David Boder: In the same lager?

00:04:50.902 --> 00:04:52.906
Roma Tcharnabroda: In the same lager that was a labor camp.

00:04:52.906 --> 00:04:53.922
David Boder: Were you able to see him?

00:04:53.922 --> 00:04:55.716
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes. Then I could still see him.

00:04:55.716 --> 00:04:56.093
David Boder: Continue

00:04:56.093 --> 00:05:04.282
Roma Tcharnabroda: Then I ran away from the labor lager and from my husband too. And we arrived “on the black” in the Governor’s General District.

00:05:04.282 --> 00:05:05.308
David Boder: What does it mean “on the black”?

00:05:05.308 --> 00:05:07.837
Roma Tcharnabroda: “On the black” means without permission of the German authorities.

00:05:07.837 --> 00:05:08.853
David Boder: Where did you arrive?

00:05:08.853 --> 00:05:11.845
Roma Tcharnabroda: Near Kielce in a small town, to Nielpe [??]

00:05:11.845 --> 00:05:14.904
David Boder: Yes. Why do you call it the “Governor General’s district”?

00:05:14.904 --> 00:05:18.842
Roma Tcharnabroda: Because then they established already the term “Governor General’s district.”

00:05:18.842 --> 00:05:18.952
David Boder: So. Continue.

00:05:18.952 --> 00:05:28.903
Roma Tcharnabroda: And then from the Governor’s...I then, I spent a few months in the Governor’s General district, that was at the end of 1941, 1942, and then the deportations began.

00:05:28.903 --> 00:05:29.891
David Boder: Hm...

00:05:29.891 --> 00:05:37.125
Roma Tcharnabroda: My Polish friends, when things started in Warsaw, so the Polish friends came to me and said: you all go in the “smelt”

00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:38.390
David Boder: They were all in Warsaw.

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.031
Roma Tcharnabroda: No, that was in a little town in the environs of Kielce...of Kielce...

00:05:42.031 --> 00:05:43.915
David Boder: Yes, and what did the Polish friends say, “you all go in...”

00:05:43.915 --> 00:05:47.406
Roma Tcharnabroda: The Jews of Warsaw go all to the “smelt”

00:05:47.406 --> 00:05:48.182
David Boder: What does that mean, to the “smelt.”

00:05:48.182 --> 00:05:51.204
Roma Tcharnabroda: To the smelt that is a German term: all go into the oven.

00:05:51.204 --> 00:05:51.711
David Boder: Aha...

00:05:51.711 --> 00:05:55.082
Roma Tcharnabroda: The Jews from Warsaw did[not]know yet anything for sure...

00:05:55.082 --> 00:05:56.520
David Boder: But these, the Poles knew already, because they knew where all these transports...Yes

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:10.818
Roma Tcharnabroda: . . . with Jews came from. And so I obtained Aryan papers, and fled to Warsaw. I was on the Aryan side until the end of 1942.

00:06:10.818 --> 00:06:13.260
David Boder: The Aryan side means outside, outside...?

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.968
Roma Tcharnabroda: Outside of the ghetto.

00:06:13.968 --> 00:06:14.720
David Boder: Yes. Outside the ghetto, yes

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.169
Roma Tcharnabroda: At the end of 1942 I was compelled to enter the ghetto.

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:21.063
David Boder: How come? If you had Aryan papers...

00:06:21.063 --> 00:06:21.063
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes...because there was an entirely special strata in Polish society which occupied itself with betraying of the Jews, very simple.

00:06:21.063 --> 00:06:33.628
David Boder: Go on.

00:06:33.628 --> 00:06:40.885
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes. And then simply I was compelled...I was robbed of everything and I was compelled to go to the ghetto.

00:06:40.885 --> 00:06:41.365
David Boder: Hm

00:06:41.365 --> 00:07:16.686
Roma Tcharnabroda: . . . naturally without a penny. That was after the so-called first deportation from Warsaw. The Warsaw
                        ghetto was already then very small. According to statistics it had only fifty thousand Jews. But some were still in hiding and there probably were more. I went through the second deportation in 1943, in January. Then there were the so-called “Value Conservation Installation,” that was a Germany Company; it occupied itself with sorting out of all the things that remained after the Jews.

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:18.071
David Boder: What was it called, “Value...

00:07:18.071 --> 00:07:20.065
Roma Tcharnabroda: Value Conservation

00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:20.841
David Boder: Value...

00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:21.610
Roma Tcharnabroda: Conservation

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:22.107
David Boder: Conservation

00:07:22.107 --> 00:07:22.424
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes.

00:07:22.424 --> 00:07:23.550
David Boder: That was a German Company?

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:28.857
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes. And the Jews were compelled to work there. It so happened that I worked on this installation.

00:07:28.857 --> 00:07:30.063
David Boder: And what were they doing there?

00:07:30.063 --> 00:07:35.291
Roma Tcharnabroda: What were they doing...they were sorting...bed linen, and such clothes, each

00:07:35.291 --> 00:07:36.527
David Boder: and where did they get it?

00:07:36.527 --> 00:07:42.044
Roma Tcharnabroda: From the ghetto proper. There was a big store-house of all the things that remained behind.

00:07:42.044 --> 00:07:42.741
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:42.741 --> 00:07:52.627
Roma Tcharnabroda: And so. There I went through the second deportation. There still remained people in Warsaw. May I tell something about those people in misery, whom I have seen...

00:07:52.627 --> 00:07:54.481
David Boder: Yes, yes, yes. What you have seen, you should tell.

00:07:54.481 --> 00:08:43.772
Roma Tcharnabroda: And so. During the actual deportation, troops were taken from us “for work.” That means I entered a room where an old woman was lying on a bed. She held in her hand a card; she apparently wanted to show that she was occupied somewhere. And with this card in her hand and her mouth open, she was shot. The cry of death was still “glaring”[?]from her face, and the open mouth, the last outcry...one should not forget it. Then we came, we saw the most varied scenes, which are completely indescribable, because this could last for long hours. The Jewish police has gathered together the bodies, which we still saw, saw them at work. The streets were full of blood.

00:08:43.772 --> 00:08:47.073
David Boder: What do you mean, bodies that you had seen, or people that you had seen?

00:08:47.073 --> 00:08:58.052
Roma Tcharnabroda: With bodies of people, because they were shooting during the march. All the columns which were led to the square, now the name of the square, that I have already forgotten.

00:08:58.052 --> 00:08:58.342
David Boder: Yes, go on.

00:08:58.342 --> 00:09:07.766
Roma Tcharnabroda: The square, that was a siding that led to the railroad. And from there all transports were sent to Treblinka.

00:09:07.766 --> 00:09:10.384
David Boder: Where is Treblinka?

00:09:10.384 --> 00:09:14.336
Roma Tcharnabroda: Treblinka is eastward from Warsaw.

00:09:14.336 --> 00:09:15.405
David Boder: How far about.

00:09:15.405 --> 00:09:17.189
Roma Tcharnabroda: A three hour trip.

00:09:17.189 --> 00:09:19.712
David Boder: Hm. Near what city is it.

00:09:19.712 --> 00:09:22.983
Roma Tcharnabroda: What city...towards Bialystok, in the direction of Bialystok.

00:09:22.983 --> 00:09:25.744
David Boder: Yes, now continue.

00:09:25.744 --> 00:10:06.579
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes. We had then already the first attempts at resistance in the 
                            Warsaw
                            Ghetto
                        . There were cases of shootings but not yet coordinated. The organizations worked, but it was not yet, the work was not yet coordinated, and the help from outside was very small. Second—we knew only one thing—that the struggle was lost. We are a last platoon that must die. At that time they took the children, the children’s home where the [rather ] famous Jewish...Jewish educator had worked. The Child of Poland—is his work.

00:10:06.579 --> 00:10:06.939
David Boder: Well...

00:10:06.939 --> 00:10:12.306
Roma Tcharnabroda: I have forgotten his name too...

00:10:12.306 --> 00:10:12.795
David Boder: Continue

00:10:12.795 --> 00:10:42.800
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes. The children were taken. The way in which the children were taken was also interesting. The Germans SS entered and gave the children chocolate, so that the children [would]be willing to go. The management of the hospital...of the childrens home went with them. There were even attempts to demand the release of a few. But they would not accept the demand. They would not accept the demand for release.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.497
David Boder: That means to return [the children]

00:10:43.497 --> 00:10:44.792
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes, the release...

00:10:44.792 --> 00:10:45.928
David Boder: Of the children or of them?

00:10:45.928 --> 00:10:50.351
Roma Tcharnabroda: The management. The management of the Jewish children’s home.

00:10:50.351 --> 00:10:50.924
David Boder: Nu...

00:10:50.924 --> 00:11:43.753
Roma Tcharnabroda: went with them...also then many went. Many however still remained. We were still needed for work. Not everything was yet in order. And so we continued working for a couple of months. In March came the last deportation. That was the day of the Jewish holiday, Easter, Pesach. And so we continued working for a couple of months. In March came the last deportation. That was the day of the Jewish holiday, Easter, Pesach. And so before Pesach.we were given a large [allotment]. That means a food allotment, a larger one, so that we should be more calm. The [first]...at night, at two o’clock, the signals were passed: “yes, there comes again a deportation.” The Ghetto was surrounded with various collaborators of the German SS. The “deportation” started.

00:11:43.753 --> 00:11:45.747
David Boder: And the Collaborators, who were they?

00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:48.949
Roma Tcharnabroda: Ukranians, Lithuanians.

00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:52.610
David Boder: Nu...go on

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:59.285
Roma Tcharnabroda: And there were many Ukrainians from Russia who changed over to the side of the Germans.

00:11:59.285 --> 00:12:00.740
David Boder: Now will you tell us...

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:05.768
Roma Tcharnabroda: Now about the deportation itself...that is the burning down of the ghetto and the revolt of the ghetto.

00:12:05.768 --> 00:12:07.513
David Boder: That we have. That has been

00:12:07.513 --> 00:12:07.800
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes, that you have

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:08.669
David Boder: . . . described.

00:12:08.669 --> 00:12:09.206
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes, also continuing...

00:12:09.206 --> 00:12:12.218
David Boder: Not that I am not interested, but my train leaves to-night.

00:12:12.218 --> 00:12:12.485
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes.

00:12:12.485 --> 00:12:13.943
David Boder: I want to know more about you...

00:12:13.943 --> 00:12:14.210
Roma Tcharnabroda: . . . from the lager

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.646
David Boder: Now were you deported, and what happened to you later.

00:12:16.646 --> 00:12:24.565
Roma Tcharnabroda: Deported—to Majdanek. The first transport during the last deportation went to Treblinka.

00:12:24.565 --> 00:12:57.500
David Boder: [In English] It is here...as I said before an interview at the university where I am forced to interview a certain number of students. I therefore have to give them a limited time. That is the first time in my procedure that I am doing it and am therefore insisting to get the personal story of Mrs. Tcharnabroda, to skip the possibly very important personal story about the ghetto and about the transportation to the concentration camp.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:58.832
David Boder: [In German] And so you were in Majdanek?

00:12:58.832 --> 00:12:59.399
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes.

00:12:59.399 --> 00:12:59.826
David Boder: Nu...

00:12:59.826 --> 00:13:05.872
Roma Tcharnabroda: And so the first transports went to Treblinka. The last, I was in the last, went to Majdanek.

00:13:05.872 --> 00:13:06.888
David Boder: And where was your husband?

00:13:06.888 --> 00:13:09.910
Roma Tcharnabroda: Always with me, together, to Majdanek.

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:10.487
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:10.487 --> 00:13:13.000
Roma Tcharnabroda: First we got to the airfield Plaza Lashkevich.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.059
David Boder: Have you no children?

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:32.788
Roma Tcharnabroda: No. First we were taken to the airfield Plaza Lashkevich, that is near Lublin. There, at this airfield, we already...the men were taken in another direction, and we in another direction. It was then that I lost the husband.

00:13:32.788 --> 00:13:35.321
David Boder: Oh. Did you ever hear from him?

00:13:35.321 --> 00:13:36.177
Roma Tcharnabroda: No.

00:13:36.177 --> 00:13:37.295
David Boder: Go on.

00:13:37.295 --> 00:13:38.792
Roma Tcharnabroda: Then we were...

00:13:38.792 --> 00:13:43.123
David Boder: How does that stand up legally and officially? Are you recognized as a widow?

00:13:43.123 --> 00:13:43.662
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes.

00:13:43.662 --> 00:13:44.299
David Boder: How come, in spite of that you...

00:13:44.299 --> 00:13:52.384
Roma Tcharnabroda: Because I had received later a message that he was sent to Travniki, and Travniki was so annihilated that not a single witness had remained.

00:13:52.384 --> 00:13:53.939
David Boder: Oh...continue.

00:13:53.939 --> 00:14:15.718
Roma Tcharnabroda: [pause] Then, the next day we were taken to Majdanek. That is two kilometers on the Kelmer [??] road, that is the read to Kelm [??]. We were led two kilometers along that road under guard [??] of the SS. That means that for every five women, four SS were marching along, [laughter] with their arms.

00:14:15.718 --> 00:14:17.764
David Boder: For every five women, or for every five rows?

00:14:17.764 --> 00:14:19.281
Roma Tcharnabroda: Five women.

00:14:19.281 --> 00:14:20.399
David Boder: . . . four SS.?

00:14:20.399 --> 00:14:21.615
Roma Tcharnabroda: Four SS were marching along, with arms.

00:14:21.615 --> 00:14:21.863
David Boder: Now continue.

00:14:21.863 --> 00:14:27.859
Roma Tcharnabroda: Of course we did not know, where we were going. We thought that straight into the ovens. We...

00:14:27.859 --> 00:14:29.685
David Boder: How come, did you know already that such things are happening.

00:14:29.685 --> 00:14:31.621
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes, then we knew that it happens.

00:14:31.621 --> 00:14:32.200
David Boder: Nu.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.336
Roma Tcharnabroda: . . . because many had already escaped from Treblinka.

00:14:34.336 --> 00:14:34.905
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:34.905 --> 00:14:44.518
Roma Tcharnabroda: Also, then we arrived there, first to the bathing installation. Then in the bathing installation they proceeded with a selection.

00:14:44.518 --> 00:14:46.263
David Boder: Describe that, how was that done.

00:14:46.263 --> 00:14:50.812
Roma Tcharnabroda: That means that there came an SS—man, and...we were completely naked...

00:14:50.812 --> 00:14:52.846
David Boder: and this SS was a man not a woman...

00:14:52.846 --> 00:14:56.758
Roma Tcharnabroda: No. Men, women also, but men with dogs.

00:14:56.758 --> 00:14:58.329
David Boder: Nu...

00:14:58.329 --> 00:15:20.894
Roma Tcharnabroda: And then they simply looked us over, like animals; looked into our teeth, tested our muscles simply with their hands. And the dogs barked, and then some [people] the older women and the sick were pushed to one side. These did not come out anymore from the bath house. Afterwards we were bathed, and we were...

00:15:20.894 --> 00:15:22.149
David Boder: In the same bath house?

00:15:22.149 --> 00:15:30.560
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes. But the bath house was divided in two parts. This was the old crematory. The new was not yet ready. That we ourselves constructed.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.389
David Boder: Nu.

00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:48.663
Roma Tcharnabroda: And so there...these never came out from there. We had our turn in the bath house, bathed, then we were given other clothes, everything was taken away. In addition we were told that we should conceal nothing, because we shall be gynecologically examined.

00:15:48.663 --> 00:15:50.128
David Boder: Men did that?

00:15:50.128 --> 00:15:50.638
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes.

00:15:50.638 --> 00:15:52.209
David Boder: And...[not clear]

00:15:52.209 --> 00:16:10.262
Roma Tcharnabroda: Some women, out of excitement, that they were standing for the first time completely naked [she giggles] before men [?] became hysterical. They cried terribly. But among us were such [women] who said: If they are not ashamed, why should we be ashamed. And so, later we were given other clothes...

00:16:10.262 --> 00:16:11.378
David Boder: Did they cut off your hair?

00:16:11.378 --> 00:16:21.983
Roma Tcharnabroda: . . . No...rags of course and we were sent off to Field 5. That is the renowned extermination field[Footnote: It is obvious that in an extermination camp, hair serves a purpose as a cultivating media for lice—[the main carriers of typhus—DPB.] There were...

00:16:21.983 --> 00:16:23.089
David Boder: In what year was that?

00:16:23.089 --> 00:16:55.495
Roma Tcharnabroda: 1943, March [Her voice sounds like a military command] And so...in this extermination camp, the first days everything was almost excellent. We were told everything will be allright. A propaganda was even conducted that we are going not in the ovens, but that we are here for work etc. They even brought in women with children. Among the women and children there were two barracks, which represented the so called quarantine, quarantine. Then we were naturally assigned boards and [word not clear]

00:16:55.495 --> 00:16:56.254
David Boder: What?

00:16:56.254 --> 00:16:57.120
Roma Tcharnabroda: Boards, in the barracks

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:57.735
David Boder: to sleep on...

00:16:57.735 --> 00:17:25.389
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes. The first days it was not so bad. Then it began. They have received orders to beat more, because too few of us were dying. The contingent of dead was too small, Right the first days. Then the sickness of diarrhea [?]. From this sickness very many died. Why? [??]—[in a positive tone] the Jewesses were not permitted to come to the revier.

00:17:25.389 --> 00:17:25.918
David Boder: . . . hospital?

00:17:25.918 --> 00:17:45.725
Roma Tcharnabroda: . . . to come to the hospital. For the Jewesses it was only one thing: healthy or dead. No revier, no sick...no help for the sick. There were also Polish women. They came from Warsaw, from Paviak [?] from the prison, political [prisoners]. And they were helping us.

00:17:45.725 --> 00:17:47.202
David Boder: What does it mean Polish political prisoner?

00:17:47.202 --> 00:18:21.838
Roma Tcharnabroda: Political prisoners, that means no such that were simply picked up on the street. But such who for politics [were] taken to the Paviak prison and later sent away to Majdanek. These were helping us. That means they brought us medicines, which were simply stolen from the revier, and they gave us [?] various medicines. Later is started, that every week there was a selection [the spool becomes noisy and in places indistinct]. The SS[?] for that selection [here is an empty streak on the reproduction and it should be checked with the original. It is also possible that we have turned away from the microphone. I apparently asked her about stoppage in menstruation].

00:18:21.838 --> 00:18:28.732
Roma Tcharnabroda: . . . about 90%. Right after we arrived in the lager we all stopped menstruating.

00:18:28.732 --> 00:18:31.051
David Boder: How was that explained?

00:18:31.051 --> 00:18:56.239
Roma Tcharnabroda: The German physicians explained it was due [??] to excitement, and also due to absence of men.[Footnote: There were various “medical” legends in the lagers and in the DP camps.—DPB.] Such was the explanation of the physicians. We were unable to detect whether there was something in the food or not. Of course we were too exhausted from the journey [?] to be able to notice, what was going on. At any rate up to 90% lost the menstruation.

00:18:56.239 --> 00:18:58.323
David Boder: And how long did that last.

00:18:58.323 --> 00:19:02.363
Roma Tcharnabroda: For some it was forever, for some, for quite a few it has returned.

00:19:02.363 --> 00:19:03.149
David Boder: After liberation?

00:19:03.149 --> 00:19:39.851
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes, after liberation. After nine, ten months. Also in Majdanek. [?] Each week begins with a selection, that means the theme in Majdanek was completely obvious [?]. We spent sixteen hours in the open air. We were not permitted to enter the barracks during the day. That means even if it rained or anything we had to stay outside. We could not enter the barracks—for full eighteen hours. Only eight hours...

00:19:39.851 --> 00:19:40.817
David Boder: Nu.

00:19:40.817 --> 00:19:42.863
Roma Tcharnabroda: . . . eight hours in the barracks.

00:19:42.863 --> 00:19:44.109
David Boder: What kind of work were you doing.

00:19:44.109 --> 00:20:25.189
Roma Tcharnabroda: No. I must tell you still about the climate. Such was the climate. It was windy, and then again sun. And it burned very hot [?] so that the legs would swell, and at that time during selection he looked only at the legs: whether they were swollen or not. So that many completely healthy and strong women, only because their feet were swollen—were compelled to go into the oven. [With didactic expression] And then exactly every week, a whole transport went into the oven. The SS man stood there eating candy bonbons. And, with the bonbon in his mouth, he pointed, this one to the right, and this one to the left. And what that meant—we knew already.

00:20:25.189 --> 00:20:46.818
David Boder: [In English] This concludes Spool 155 [B] with the interview of Ms. Roma Tcharna— Tcharnabroda. In spite of...[spool ends abruptly]

00:20:46.818 --> 00:21:10.825
David Boder: Munich, September the 24th. We are working...we are working under very great pressure. I am leaving tonight and it’s four o’clock. The Senate of the UNRRA University, the International University of displaced people is expecting that I will attend a short meeting of theirs; and I have here a most interesting interviewee, Ms. Roma Tcharnabroda.

00:21:10.825 --> 00:21:12.825
David Boder: [In German] Now continue.

00:21:12.825 --> 00:21:27.336
Roma Tcharnabroda: After this selection, a few hundred women disappeared from the warehouse. In the evening we saw a big fire and the next day, the whole day we felt the smoke of burning flesh.

00:21:27.336 --> 00:21:29.636
David Boder: Were they burned in the oven or in the crematoria?

00:21:29.636 --> 00:21:59.126
Roma Tcharnabroda: In the creamatories. And then—the creamtories were not yet completed. For that reason they gas-killed them in the bath house, and then they laid the bodies out in the field. There was a big ditch in the field, such as in a [word not clear] and there they were burned. For that reason we every week right after the selection, we observed a large square fire, and then we “felt” the smoke of burned flesh.

00:21:59.126 --> 00:22:00.294
David Boder: That was in Majdanek

00:22:00.294 --> 00:22:02.907
Roma Tcharnabroda: And then

00:22:02.907 --> 00:22:04.013
David Boder: How do you spell Majdanek?

00:22:04.013 --> 00:22:08.462
Roma Tcharnabroda: Maj-da-nek. M-a-j-d-a-...that is known—Majdanek

00:22:08.462 --> 00:22:09.011
David Boder: Yes, I know

00:22:09.011 --> 00:22:10.576
Roma Tcharnabroda: Maj-da-nek

00:22:10.576 --> 00:22:12.340
David Boder: . . . nek. Continue.

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:46.805
Roma Tcharnabroda: And then a few days later, we would go as a working crew to that place, and carried the ashes into the fields. The fields of Majdanek are now fructiferous, from the ashes of the burned people, Now then...these selections were insufficient. They had to present us with another spectacle, and that was the hanging in Majdanek. It was supposedly as punishment for escape, allegedly some had attempted to escape. That was also not true. Because it was impossible to imagine that such a thing could be attempted there.

00:22:46.805 --> 00:22:48.522
David Boder: Were there women and men, or...

00:22:48.522 --> 00:22:50.905
Roma Tcharnabroda: Women. I am speaking about the women’s field.

00:22:50.905 --> 00:22:53.111
David Boder: And women were hanged?

00:22:53.111 --> 00:22:53.468
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes.

00:22:53.468 --> 00:22:54.347
David Boder: Now what...

00:22:54.347 --> 00:23:13.193
Roma Tcharnabroda: A...that happened...that was soon...two months...March...April, May, in May, a woman was brought in. She must have...all at once we noticed that in the middle of the field some- thing was standing. We really did not know what it meant. And so they had...what do you call it?

00:23:13.193 --> 00:23:13.762
David Boder: The gallows...

00:23:13.762 --> 00:23:33.637
Roma Tcharnabroda: the gallows erected, and this woman...we all had to stand for appell, we stood forming a square, facing the gallows, and then...the woman was compelled to fetch the chair herself. She stood upon the chair and then the SS man asked: what would be her last wish.

00:23:33.637 --> 00:23:34.478
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:34.478 --> 00:24:22.600
Roma Tcharnabroda: I stood then very near. She said she had no wish from the Germans. So he asked her whether she regretted her deed. So she said, she was not attempting to escape, because that was absurd. But if she only had a chance, she would have done it. She regrets nothing at all, because life at any rate has no worth, and she dies readily. But to slap him in the face, she probably was too weak. She died calmly without a single outcry. That woman was twenty three years old. Then we had to stand as punishment,—we don’t know what for—but as punishment we had to stand and look at the dead [woman] for three hours. When the appell was over...

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.325
David Boder: Who performed the hanging?

00:24:24.325 --> 00:24:26.279
Roma Tcharnabroda: An SS man. He...

00:24:26.279 --> 00:24:27.584
David Boder: Did she suffer much?

00:24:27.584 --> 00:24:34.774
Roma Tcharnabroda: No. He only swung the noose around her neck and pushed the chair away with his foot.

00:24:34.774 --> 00:24:36.780
David Boder: Did he first cover her face?

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:39.523
Roma Tcharnabroda: No. She died with open eyes.

00:24:39.523 --> 00:24:42.784
David Boder: So you saw the dead woman afterwards and the face of the dead woman?

00:24:42.784 --> 00:24:50.087
Roma Tcharnabroda: I stood for two hours afterwards, directly in front of her at a distance of about ten meters.

00:24:50.087 --> 00:24:51.744
David Boder: How did she look?

00:24:51.744 --> 00:24:55.846
Roma Tcharnabroda: Perfectly calm. Her hands were stretched downward and folded.

00:24:55.846 --> 00:24:56.533
David Boder: And her face?

00:24:56.533 --> 00:25:05.092
Roma Tcharnabroda: . . . her face downward, fixed like this [one word not clear] looking downward and perfectly alm as if she would have been...no, perfectly calm as if she slept.

00:25:05.092 --> 00:25:06.647
David Boder: Nu.

00:25:06.647 --> 00:25:18.645
Roma Tcharnabroda: Afterwards we had to stand for several hours and look at the dead. When the appell was over we did not go away. There were at that time twenty thousand women at the appell.

00:25:18.645 --> 00:25:19.174
David Boder: Twenty thousand...?

00:25:19.174 --> 00:25:21.459
Roma Tcharnabroda: [emphatically]...thousand women, prisoners, for appell.

00:25:21.459 --> 00:25:22.767
David Boder: Now how do you know the number?

00:25:22.767 --> 00:25:25.350
Roma Tcharnabroda: [irritated] It was...we carried numbers.

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:28.671
David Boder: But not all were there. Many were annihilated...

00:25:28.671 --> 00:25:33.066
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes, sure, but how many...few were missing because every day they take count.

00:25:33.066 --> 00:25:33.528
David Boder: And...

00:25:33.528 --> 00:25:34.729
Roma Tcharnabroda: And each block was counted.

00:25:34.729 --> 00:25:36.111
David Boder: And you knew how many there were?

00:25:36.111 --> 00:26:06.174
Roma Tcharnabroda: I know exactly. [emphatically] There were over twenty thousand in the lager at that time. We all remained standing, without having agreed upon. We all remained standing for several minutes. The SS even thought [giggling] that we had attempted a revolt. We only remained standing to honor the dead [woman]. And even all [of us]. That time there were already Russian [women], Polish [women] and Jewesses. And all remained standing like dead after the end of the appell. Afterwards it started...

00:26:06.174 --> 00:26:09.565
David Boder: Did you not have there a clergyman, a rabbi?

00:26:09.565 --> 00:26:10.072
Roma Tcharnabroda: Where?

00:26:10.072 --> 00:26:13.244
David Boder: . . . to give the woman the last rites?

00:26:13.244 --> 00:26:23.022
Roma Tcharnabroda: Oh God, the SS does not recognize, did not recognize any clergy. They had torn down from the Polish women all the medallions, and all such objects; they said, “Here one needs no God any more.”

00:26:23.022 --> 00:26:23.854
David Boder: Nu...

00:26:23.854 --> 00:26:25.954
Roma Tcharnabroda: ‘God won’t help you anyway:

00:26:25.954 --> 00:26:29.734
David Boder: You see I do know it, to be sure; but I am asking it for my American friends...

00:26:29.734 --> 00:26:31.896
Roma Tcharnabroda: [laughing] Yes, they know very little about this [laughter]

00:26:31.896 --> 00:26:33.541
David Boder: Now continue.

00:26:33.541 --> 00:26:39.601
Roma Tcharnabroda: Interesting, a chapter by itself is the qurantanne, the quarantanne where...

00:26:39.601 --> 00:26:40.188
David Boder: the quarantine?

00:26:40.188 --> 00:27:45.136
Roma Tcharnabroda: the quarantine, the quarantine, yes, where there were women with children. There were no multiple level plankbeds, because the children could not climb up there. All children were lying on the floor. We were not permitted there, but we wanted to see what that really was. So at times we would enter with one cleaning detail to sprinkle around the chlorine. And the children were lying on the floor and it was full of excrements, because the children could not step out at night. And a child does not look out. In hell one does not see such sights as one has seen there. Dirty, hungry children, like animals, everything, they all looked. And then one “nice” morning, all the children with...with their mothers were taken in such a vehicle, in automobiles, a few automobiles, arrived, they were all taken [to] the creamtory and that was all. Then they brought into the quarantine Greek Jewesses, [didactically] two hundred women from Salonika. These were brought from Auschwitz. We could understand each other very little, because they spoke only Greek.

00:27:45.136 --> 00:27:46.079
David Boder: What?

00:27:46.079 --> 00:27:47.484
Roma Tcharnabroda: . . . they spoke Greek. Some of them understood Hebrew.

00:27:47.484 --> 00:27:47.848
David Boder: Nu...

00:27:47.848 --> 00:28:17.349
Roma Tcharnabroda: And with these one could communicate a bit. After a month, these too had disappeared from the lager. The quarantine came to an end. The two hundred Greek women from Salonika were killed in Majdanek. Then they brought in Russian women, Russian [women] from Smolensk, from that district, from that region. This was a part.

00:28:17.349 --> 00:28:18.797
David Boder: Russian Christian women?

00:28:18.797 --> 00:28:27.582
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes. This was only a part, who had come alive from the battle of Smolensk. They too went to the “smelt.”

00:28:27.582 --> 00:28:28.358
David Boder: Nu...

00:28:28.358 --> 00:28:57.917
Roma Tcharnabroda: Later, the strongest from among twenty thousand women were sent away in several transports. I was in the first transport, which was sent to a factory. I belonged that time to the strongest women and therefore I was sent away. Also this selection was terrible. We were looked at like at horses, the muscles tested like...the teeth, all that inspected...completely naked; this the SS men did.

00:28:57.917 --> 00:29:04.759
David Boder: Did they ever make a gynecological examination in search for coins, money or the like?

00:29:04.759 --> 00:29:08.682
Roma Tcharnabroda: . . . for money. A few of the women were picked out at that time and examined.

00:29:08.682 --> 00:29:09.708
David Boder: Yes, now...

00:29:09.708 --> 00:29:10.355
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes. And...

00:29:10.355 --> 00:29:15.912
David Boder: I mean not at this particular occasion, but in general...did they just threaten with...

00:29:15.912 --> 00:29:17.557
Roma Tcharnabroda: No, at that time that was done

00:29:17.557 --> 00:29:19.837
David Boder: They performed gynecological...Who was doing that?

00:29:19.837 --> 00:29:22.612
Roma Tcharnabroda: A physician. A German physician in uniform.

00:29:22.612 --> 00:29:26.612
David Boder: And that means they really searched for...

00:29:26.612 --> 00:29:27.929
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes...yes, yes.

00:29:27.929 --> 00:29:29.307
David Boder: No go on.

00:29:29.307 --> 00:30:13.761
Roma Tcharnabroda: And then I was gone to a labor lager, to Skarzysko-Kamienna. There was a lager only for Jews who worked in a factory, an ammunition factory. Most of...there were already not SS, that is the lager were SS and Ukrainians, but as shop- shupes [shop-guards] we had Ukrainians and then there were German foremen, not SS. That was chateristic of the German psyche, that not only SS have all that perpetrated, but German foremen as well. There is known the name of a German foreman Krause, who out of Malice [?]

00:30:13.761 --> 00:30:14.470
David Boder: What was the name?

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:18.181
Roma Tcharnabroda: Skarzysko-Kamienna [one word not clear].

00:30:18.181 --> 00:30:19.786
David Boder: Do you know his first name?

00:30:19.786 --> 00:30:43.066
Roma Tcharnabroda: No. Krause. That was the most terrible [thing] in the factory. When Krause would go by [laughter], then the machinery would go differently, even that [laughter]. He could [treat] women...sometime he would come drunk, pick a few women and rape them, and later they were shot—so that there [would] be no race polution.

00:30:43.066 --> 00:30:44.090
David Boder: Yes. [three words not clear]

00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:56.851
Roma Tcharnabroda: There was a well known SS Waffenschlager, Waffen- schlager [the name really means gunsmith but schlagen also means beating]. He did the same thing. The brother of such a raped woman lives here in Germany.

00:30:56.851 --> 00:30:58.106
David Boder: I should like to ask you something in general...

00:30:58.106 --> 00:31:08.112
Roma Tcharnabroda: [interrupting] And here one more interesting thing. There was work of the furnaces [?? This word is either not clear or is a colloquialism which she did not clear up even when asked about it. One could not be too persistent with such questions]. The so called “yellow labor” [with pathos], at this yellow labor at the factory people perished.

00:31:08.112 --> 00:31:09.577
David Boder: What kind of work was that?

00:31:09.577 --> 00:31:11.483
Roma Tcharnabroda: At the furnaces [??] That is so...

00:31:11.483 --> 00:31:12.222
David Boder: Oh, furnaces [??]

00:31:12.222 --> 00:31:33.728
Roma Tcharnabroda: Furnaces [??] Yes. One must take precautions, otherwise one perishes. And at these...at these furnaces [??]...at these furnaces the Jews worked, and perished in a few months. When they were already badly sick, they were...they were led away somewhere, led into the woods and there they were exterminated.

00:31:33.728 --> 00:31:45.591
David Boder: I want to ask you one question: in general to what extent did women suffer from attempts of rape, or other advances of the guards?

00:31:45.591 --> 00:31:55.024
Roma Tcharnabroda: Officially it was prohibited. But it only appeared that way. For instance, from Majdanek, the most beautiful girls had disappeared.

00:31:55.024 --> 00:31:56.040
David Boder: [a pause] Now go on.

00:31:56.040 --> 00:33:29.655
Roma Tcharnabroda: And then from Skarzysko we were taken to Czestochowa, also to a munitions factory. In Czestochowa there was a repetition of the beatings at work. The provisions were such that several died from hunger. The people from Majdanek suffered most. From twelve hundred women who came from Majdanek to Skarzysko and Czestochowa only very few remained. From the twenty thousand women at Majdanek there are now here—as far as I am able to ascertain—there remain approximately fifty. Then from Czestochowa we were transported to Germany, when the Russians approached. The first...I was in the first transport. The others remained behind, because they were already unable to drive them out. I came to Ravensbruck. In Ravensbruck the lager was prepared for approximately three thousand people. Afterwards by the end of nineteen forty-five...no 1944 and at the beginning of 1945 there were over sixteen thousand...sixty thousand people. I can not give the exact number. All the transports from the east were sent to Ravensbruck. The conditions were terrible. Four persons on one plankbed. Lice and the food, terrible. My work was chopping wood. At this wood chopping I had my feet frozen.

00:33:29.655 --> 00:33:31.130
David Boder: That was in what year?

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:34.456
Roma Tcharnabroda: At the beginning of 19...in January 1945.

00:33:34.456 --> 00:33:35.596
David Boder: Nu.

00:33:35.596 --> 00:33:46.576
Roma Tcharnabroda: The SS woman saw that I am walking without, without stockings. And when I once reported to her that I am unable to work in the woods, I was given twenty five [strokes].

00:33:46.576 --> 00:33:47.854
David Boder: What does that mean you have...

00:33:47.854 --> 00:33:50.337
Roma Tcharnabroda: Twenty five strokes on the bare back.

00:33:50.337 --> 00:33:52.732
David Boder: When did that happen? As soon as you told her?

00:33:52.732 --> 00:33:53.678
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes right away.

00:33:53.678 --> 00:33:54.716
David Boder: Not during the appell.

00:33:54.716 --> 00:33:56.243
Roma Tcharnabroda: Not at the appell, right away.

00:33:56.243 --> 00:33:57.758
David Boder: Who administered the twenty five strokes?

00:33:57.758 --> 00:33:58.704
Roma Tcharnabroda: An SS woman.

00:33:58.704 --> 00:34:01.189
David Boder: Another, not the same to whom you spoke.

00:34:01.189 --> 00:34:04.133
Roma Tcharnabroda: The same, the same. [pause]

00:34:04.133 --> 00:34:05.438
David Boder: [timidly] Now did you permit it?

00:34:05.438 --> 00:34:13.150
Roma Tcharnabroda: What do you mean “permit”? [loud laughter] “permit”? What does that mean “permit”? Can you imagine that “permit”? [laughter]

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:13.729
David Boder: Well.

00:34:13.729 --> 00:34:19.807
Roma Tcharnabroda: In a lager there is no more resistance. About resistance we could speak only in the WarsawGhetto, but not here.

00:34:19.807 --> 00:34:20.965
David Boder: Were they holding you?

00:34:20.965 --> 00:34:25.250
Roma Tcharnabroda: [still laughing] But of course, they stretched me out and gave me twenty five.

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:26.205
David Boder: Nu.

00:34:26.205 --> 00:34:30.967
Roma Tcharnabroda: [the laughter has subsided] I have from it still now a very large scar.

00:34:30.967 --> 00:34:30.967
David Boder: What were you beaten with?

00:34:30.967 --> 00:34:35.498
Roma Tcharnabroda: With a horse whip [riding whip].

00:34:35.498 --> 00:34:37.233
David Boder: So.

00:34:37.233 --> 00:34:56.670
Roma Tcharnabroda: By that time I was already sick but I continued to go to work in the woods. There I worked for several months and had my legs frozen. When the Americans approached we were sent from Ravensbruck in the direction of Dachau.

00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:57.586
David Boder: On foot or by...

00:34:57.586 --> 00:34:59.213
Roma Tcharnabroda: No, on vehicles.

00:34:59.213 --> 00:35:01.027
David Boder: In automobiles?

00:35:01.027 --> 00:35:03.043
Roma Tcharnabroda: No, in locked box cars.

00:35:03.043 --> 00:35:04.979
David Boder: Oh yes, by train, by railroad...

00:35:04.979 --> 00:35:13.723
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes. And for eight days we were given nothing. That means not even water.

00:35:13.723 --> 00:35:16.177
David Boder: Now tell me, how does one live eight days without water.

00:35:16.177 --> 00:35:49.251
Roma Tcharnabroda: That is interesting. [with apparent hostility]. Of course you are unable to imagine how much a human being can stand. That we know [ironic smile—revealed in a hm, continues accentuating every word] Eight days without water. At the end, that was near Bayreuth, we decided, there were already many dead, out of hunger, and of course, out of exhaustion, we decided to knock. Let them shoot. And we knocked so that they were afraid we will break up, smash up the whole boxcar.

00:35:49.251 --> 00:35:49.929
David Boder: Hm.

00:35:49.929 --> 00:36:05.400
Roma Tcharnabroda: They threatened: ‘we are going to shoot,’ and we said; ‘shoot,’ and so then they brought us ? from the Red Cross. And they said [she ironically imitates a supposedly friendly tone]: ‘children, we want to help you, why are you so restless?’ Then we...

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.536
David Boder: That was the Red Cross?

00:36:06.536 --> 00:36:20.262
Roma Tcharnabroda: No, the SS. Then we were already children, because they saw, that with us it is not so easy. And then we continued traveling. We arrived in Burgau, a branch of Dachau.

00:36:20.262 --> 00:36:21.527
David Boder: Not far from Dachau?

00:36:21.527 --> 00:36:22.635
Roma Tcharnabroda: A branch of Dachau. I don’t know how far...

00:36:22.635 --> 00:36:23.282
David Boder: . . . a branch?

00:36:23.282 --> 00:36:24.707
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes, a branch from Dachau.

00:36:24.707 --> 00:36:27.092
David Boder: That is not very far from here.

00:36:27.092 --> 00:36:39.760
Roma Tcharnabroda: I cannot orientate myself, because I don’t get around much on account of my amputated legs. We arrived there. It was still very cold, in white mantles, without underwear.

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:40.716
David Boder: What does that mean in white mantles?

00:36:40.716 --> 00:36:42.942
Roma Tcharnabroda: Such...no, what do you call them...

00:36:42.942 --> 00:36:43.698
David Boder: Cotton...

00:36:43.698 --> 00:36:46.902
Roma Tcharnabroda: Not cotton, such smocks.

00:36:46.902 --> 00:36:47.710
David Boder: Oh smocks.

00:36:47.710 --> 00:37:55.022
Roma Tcharnabroda: They gave us such mantles. No stockings. If one would get stockings—one was yellow and one black. And when we arrived we looked so terrible, that when the foremen from the Messerschmidt factory arrived to look us over and to take some of us for work, they openly stated: ‘That is an outrage.’ And then we came to Burgau. In Burgau were to be five hundred persons. But they sent in another transport. So there were a thousand women. And it started—spotted fever typhus. Very many women died from spotted fever. The Hungarian Jewesses suffered most, from spotted fever and from diarrhea. The lice were so spread out that one could not stand it. Then I came down with spotted fever, and with...and it commenced with my legs. I was unable to get up any more. From Burgau we were sent to Kirkheim.

00:37:55.022 --> 00:37:56.250
David Boder: And how did they send you? You...

00:37:56.250 --> 00:38:18.553
Roma Tcharnabroda: I was carried. The prisoners carried me, to Kirkheim. And from Kirkheim...I was completely sick, the legs were already black, so I was sent to the lager-revier, lager four, near Landsberg. The famous lager-revier in which thousands, more than thousands of people have died from spotted fever.

00:38:18.553 --> 00:38:19.731
David Boder: That is not very far from here.

00:38:19.731 --> 00:38:52.686
Roma Tcharnabroda: No, not far, Landsberg. There I already...there it started already to fester—and they could not help me any more. The physicians came of course. They told me nothing, but I saw it was the end. Then evacuation from the lager. Whoever could still walk was chased away. I of course could not get up anymore. The first...the SS came and brought a horse cart. I told him then ‘shoot me.’ So he said: ‘no child, now you will live, it is I who will be hanged.’

00:38:52.686 --> 00:38:54.253
David Boder: Why, did he know already.

00:38:54.253 --> 00:39:05.668
Roma Tcharnabroda: [laughter in her voice] He know already that the Americans are approaching. And there...it is interesting about the SS. If somebody comes forward and pleads to die, then you must live. But if you wish to live—then you must die.

00:39:05.668 --> 00:39:06.457
David Boder: Nu.

00:39:06.457 --> 00:39:53.608
Roma Tcharnabroda: And because I told him with complete indifference that I wish to die—then he says—you must live. Then I was taken again to another lager, lager one, and in lager one I was liberated by the Americans. The last day before liberation,—the SS had run away, and we remained. The front passed through our lager. On one side were the Germans, on the other the Americans. And they were shooting at each other. Those who could get out, got out. I had to lie there. Then by accident the barracks of the SS caught fire, which stood nearby. And I thought then that the barracks were set on fire by us. Everybody who could still drag his legs, ran out. I did not know what to do, because such a death in...

00:39:53.608 --> 00:39:53.955
David Boder: . . . fire.

00:39:53.955 --> 00:40:01.716
Roma Tcharnabroda: . . . in fire I did not want. Then I threw off all the blankets, and threw myself down...from the plankbed. And so I slid out.

00:40:01.716 --> 00:40:03.223
David Boder: Was it a high plankbed or a low one?

00:40:03.223 --> 00:40:05.938
Roma Tcharnabroda: These were such earth barracks...

00:40:05.938 --> 00:40:07.283
David Boder: Yes, what kind?

00:40:07.283 --> 00:40:10.028
Roma Tcharnabroda: . . . built into ground, very deep in the ground...

00:40:10.028 --> 00:40:10.295
David Boder: Oh.

00:40:10.295 --> 00:40:25.929
Roma Tcharnabroda: Like for dogs. And then, it was after the rain, I slid out, and it was after the rain. I did not have a good bandage, but only a paper dressing, and the...dirt and all that got in [into the wounds] and then everything came to an end and went kaput.

00:40:25.929 --> 00:40:26.486
David Boder: Nu.

00:40:26.486 --> 00:40:49.785
Roma Tcharnabroda: Two days after liberation the Americans took me to a German hospital, and physicians said, I will live only ten days. But I told them that I will stand ten operations. And I did stand it. However due to the beating that I got, as well as from lying—that spot was not completely [searches for words] nu...

00:40:49.785 --> 00:40:50.751
David Boder: Not completely healed?

00:40:50.751 --> 00:41:03.330
Roma Tcharnabroda: . . . was not healed, and due to the lying it became irritated, and I developed a decubitus, and a hole [was formed] and still today the scar is that big. And I got through three operations. I got through three amputations.

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:05.077
David Boder: What do you say, a decubitus?

00:41:05.077 --> 00:41:07.031
Roma Tcharnabroda: Decubitus, that is the scar, here such...

00:41:07.031 --> 00:41:10.833
David Boder: Go on. Did they operate under chloroform?

00:41:10.833 --> 00:41:11.601
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes.

00:41:11.601 --> 00:41:12.160
David Boder: Nu.

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:14.916
Roma Tcharnabroda: And the physicians predicted that I will die in ten days.

00:41:14.916 --> 00:41:15.440
David Boder: Yes.

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:18.138
Roma Tcharnabroda: I had thirty two kilos after liberation [weighed thirty two kilograms].

00:41:18.138 --> 00:41:19.244
David Boder: How much do you weigh now?

00:41:19.244 --> 00:41:21.817
Roma Tcharnabroda: Now? [laughter] Approximately over sixty. My height is one meter, sixty four [cm].

00:41:21.817 --> 00:41:22.274
David Boder: Yes.

00:41:22.274 --> 00:41:35.645
Roma Tcharnabroda: And I had thrity-two and in spite of that I pulled through. After liberation still very many died. From diarrhea. Because they started eating. It was terrible. People saw food for the first time [smiling].

00:41:35.645 --> 00:41:39.004
David Boder: In what lager was that, in Landsberg?

00:41:39.004 --> 00:41:42.527
Roma Tcharnabroda: That was in the lager, I was in lager one at the end.

00:41:42.527 --> 00:41:43.992
David Boder: But you were in the hospital in Landsberg?

00:41:43.992 --> 00:41:54.318
Roma Tcharnabroda: No, no. First I was in Holzhausen. There they cared for me very well. And from Holzhausen—to Landsberg to Schwaben [??] in Munich.

00:41:54.318 --> 00:42:02.668
Roma Tcharnabroda: . . . the lower leg, twenty centimeters below the knee. Right here, touch it.

00:42:02.668 --> 00:42:04.303
David Boder: Yes. Twenty centimeters under the knee. Now.

00:42:04.303 --> 00:42:06.597
Roma Tcharnabroda: That is called lower leg amputation.

00:42:06.597 --> 00:42:07.054
David Boder: Yes.

00:42:07.054 --> 00:42:08.568
Roma Tcharnabroda: . . . both are lost.

00:42:08.568 --> 00:42:09.196
David Boder: And...

00:42:09.196 --> 00:42:13.515
Roma Tcharnabroda: And now I walk very well. In spite of the fact that the Germans said I won’t be able to walk.

00:42:13.515 --> 00:42:15.222
David Boder: And what are you doing here at the university?

00:42:15.222 --> 00:42:16.807
Roma Tcharnabroda: I study pharmacy.

00:42:16.807 --> 00:42:19.280
David Boder: Yes. And how are things here?

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:31.151
Roma Tcharnabroda: I am very satisfied with the university. The professors are very good to us, and they are so friendly. The relations between professors and students is so great, that indeed one could not find it at any other university.

00:42:31.151 --> 00:42:32.828
David Boder: And how do the students get along?

00:42:32.828 --> 00:42:42.477
Roma Tcharnabroda: Very well. It is interesting. One was able to see that it is possible to live together. And when man lives with man then nationality plays no part. What matters is the person not the nationality.

00:42:42.477 --> 00:42:44.052
David Boder: Have you relatives in America?

00:42:44.052 --> 00:42:44.559
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes.

00:42:44.559 --> 00:42:45.884
David Boder: Do they write to you?

00:42:45.884 --> 00:42:46.274
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes.

00:42:46.274 --> 00:42:47.120
David Boder: Where do they live?

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:49.595
Roma Tcharnabroda: In Chicago. I received affidavits from Chicago.

00:42:49.595 --> 00:42:51.531
David Boder: I am from Chicago, could I look them up?

00:42:51.531 --> 00:42:51.961
Roma Tcharnabroda: [laughing] Yes.

00:42:51.961 --> 00:42:52.678
David Boder: What is their name?

00:42:52.678 --> 00:42:55.480
Roma Tcharnabroda: [cheerfully] La Salle Street...Helberg

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:56.169
David Boder: Write down their address.

00:42:56.169 --> 00:42:57.117
Roma Tcharnabroda: I bring it right away.

00:42:57.117 --> 00:42:58.744
David Boder: What is their name?

00:42:58.744 --> 00:42:59.940
Roma Tcharnabroda: Helberg.

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:01.441
David Boder: Helberg. The first name?

00:43:01.441 --> 00:43:02.549
Roma Tcharnabroda: Charles Helberg.

00:43:02.549 --> 00:43:03.038
David Boder: What?

00:43:03.038 --> 00:43:04.316
Roma Tcharnabroda: Charl Helberg.

00:43:04.316 --> 00:43:04.783
David Boder: Charl?

00:43:04.783 --> 00:43:05.562
Roma Tcharnabroda: Charles.

00:43:05.562 --> 00:43:07.935
David Boder: And that is an office on La Salle street.

00:43:07.935 --> 00:43:12.842
David Boder: What is his profession?

00:43:12.842 --> 00:43:11.387
Roma Tcharnabroda: I don’t know anything about that.

00:43:11.387 --> 00:43:12.842
David Boder: Yes. Is it his office?

00:43:12.842 --> 00:43:13.479
Roma Tcharnabroda: I don’t know.

00:43:13.479 --> 00:43:14.235
David Boder: What number on La Salle.

00:43:14.235 --> 00:43:16.611
Roma Tcharnabroda: La Salle, North, 224.

00:43:16.611 --> 00:43:17.377
David Boder: 225?

00:43:17.377 --> 00:43:18.365
Roma Tcharnabroda: 24.

00:43:18.365 --> 00:43:19.102
David Boder: 224, La Salle, North.

00:43:19.102 --> 00:43:21.286
Roma Tcharnabroda: North La Salle Street.

00:43:21.286 --> 00:43:24.398
David Boder: Now I shall see that man in two weeks.

00:43:24.398 --> 00:43:24.925
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes, that will be very...

00:43:24.925 --> 00:43:25.811
David Boder: I shall transmit regards from you.

00:43:25.811 --> 00:43:30.034
Roma Tcharnabroda: You may tell that I have received the affidavit.

00:43:30.034 --> 00:43:30.650
David Boder: Yes.

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:35.966
Roma Tcharnabroda: But I must wait for the quota. And “two legs” are not enough to get any preference.

00:43:35.966 --> 00:43:39.080
David Boder: How long...under quota do you come? The Polish?

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:45.345
Roma Tcharnabroda: On the Polish quota, and it is filled. Probably I have still to wait a year. And if by then UNNRA is out of existence then I have nothing to...

00:43:45.345 --> 00:43:48.516
David Boder: Oh, we’ll arrange that with the Nias. I myself will take care of it.

00:43:48.516 --> 00:43:53.720
Roma Tcharnabroda: [with friendly and somewhat skeptical laughter] Ya, they told me there that the quota [she means waiting list] is very large and that I can’t get over.

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:55.946
David Boder: And the name is Charles Helberg.

00:43:55.946 --> 00:43:56.114
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes.

00:43:56.114 --> 00:43:56.942
David Boder: You don’t know what his business is.

00:43:56.942 --> 00:43:57.404
Roma Tcharnabroda: No.

00:43:57.404 --> 00:43:58.747
David Boder: What is he to you?

00:43:58.747 --> 00:44:05.212
Roma Tcharnabroda: He is the uncle of my mother. But he was interested very much from the beginning, but he is unable to do [much] and...

00:44:05.212 --> 00:44:06.727
David Boder: What do you mean—unable, no money?

00:44:06.727 --> 00:44:10.817
Roma Tcharnabroda: No, it is not the money. But besides what can that help me [her voice fades, she mumbles].

00:44:10.817 --> 00:44:11.943
David Boder: You have what.

00:44:11.943 --> 00:44:15.514
Roma Tcharnabroda: [disconcerted] here I have nothing. I am maintained by UNRRA but...

00:44:15.514 --> 00:44:16.789
David Boder: Does he send you packages?

00:44:16.789 --> 00:44:25.404
Roma Tcharnabroda: No, because he can’t send. Because they sent me a few times, [but] I did not receive them.

00:44:25.404 --> 00:44:27.428
David Boder: Hm. Now is that all that you want to tell us?

00:44:27.428 --> 00:44:28.594
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes that is all that I want...

00:44:28.594 --> 00:44:30.468
David Boder: What do you want to tell to the American students. [laughingly]

00:44:30.468 --> 00:44:38.529
Roma Tcharnabroda: [also laughingly] To tell the students?—I want to say we have learned very much. Still we are not pessimists. That is we have come to learn...

00:44:38.529 --> 00:44:38.816
David Boder: Yes.

00:44:38.816 --> 00:44:58.540
Roma Tcharnabroda: . . . that there is only one reality. The reality of the Evil. But in spite of that we are not pessimists. We have also learned that the potentiality of the human soul is very great. One can stand very much [laughter]. And that is told by a human being who runs around on false limbs. Life is more interesting than death, possibly not easier.

00:44:58.540 --> 00:44:59.469
David Boder: How old are you?

00:44:59.469 --> 00:45:01.962
Roma Tcharnabroda: Thirty.

00:45:01.962 --> 00:45:04.327
David Boder: I shall look up that man. Charles Helberger?

00:45:04.327 --> 00:45:05.076
Roma Tcharnabroda: Helberg.

00:45:05.076 --> 00:45:08.644
David Boder: Hellberg, 224 North La Salle Street.

00:45:08.644 --> 00:45:09.094
Roma Tcharnabroda: Yes.

00:45:09.094 --> 00:45:11.160
David Boder: Chicago. And you don’t know his occupation.

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:11.657
Roma Tcharnabroda: No.

00:45:11.657 --> 00:45:44.111
David Boder: [In English] This concludes the most interesting spool, number 155 at the UNRRA University. [Pause. Knocking sound.] These knocks are the knocks of the artificial legs of the young girl, who just talked to me, and she is now leaving the room.
