00:01:14.782 --> 00:01:17.220

00:01:38.283 --> 00:01:38.829

00:01:49.575 --> 00:01:52.258
David Boder: And [with] your parents there were...?

00:01:52.258 --> 00:01:52.945
Esther Krueger: Too...

00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:54.320
David Boder: Nine persons in the family?

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.929
Esther Krueger: Yes.

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:59.710
David Boder: Speak a little louder. Yes. Nu, what was your father’s occupation?

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.804

00:02:02.804 --> 00:02:04.257

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:04.694
Esther Krueger: Yes.

00:02:04.694 --> 00:02:05.428
David Boder: Did he have a store?

00:02:05.428 --> 00:02:06.788
Esther Krueger: Yes. The mother too.

00:02:06.788 --> 00:02:09.756
David Boder: The mother was also in the store.

00:02:09.756 --> 00:02:10.099
Esther Krueger: Yes.

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.349
David Boder: Nu, did they earn well?

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.802
Esther Krueger: But yes. [They] earned well, but still....[We] led a good life.

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:19.052
David Boder: A good life. What sort of an education did you receive?

00:02:19.052 --> 00:02:21.067
Esther Krueger: I went to school.

00:02:21.067 --> 00:02:21.974
David Boder: What kind of school?

00:02:21.974 --> 00:02:24.661
Esther Krueger: Elementary school. I was still young.

00:02:24.661 --> 00:02:25.130
David Boder: Yes

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.723

00:02:28.848 --> 00:02:29.035
Esther Krueger: Yes.

00:02:29.035 --> 00:02:29.597
David Boder: . . . elementary school.

00:02:29.597 --> 00:02:31.034
Esther Krueger: And afterwards I was taken to the lager.

00:02:31.034 --> 00:02:37.554
David Boder: And so wait a moment. Not so fast. And so when the war began you were in a Kielce.

00:02:37.554 --> 00:02:38.393
Esther Krueger: Yes.

00:02:38.393 --> 00:02:41.502
David Boder: Who marched in? Did the German march into Kielce?

00:02:41.502 --> 00:02:42.471
Esther Krueger: The Germans.

00:02:42.471 --> 00:02:50.987
David Boder: The Germans. And so tell me what happened when the Germans entered Kielce. What happened to you [plural]? Nu? Speak.

00:02:50.987 --> 00:02:55.565
Esther Krueger: When the German came to Kielce they grabbed for forced labor.

00:02:55.565 --> 00:02:58.893
David Boder: And so tell me, how soon? Immediately or a few days...

00:02:58.893 --> 00:02:59.424
Esther Krueger: Immediately.

00:02:59.424 --> 00:03:01.830
David Boder: . . . a few days later? How was it?

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.815
Esther Krueger: When [?]?

00:03:03.815 --> 00:03:05.315
David Boder: Nu, not exactly...

00:03:05.315 --> 00:03:06.503
Esther Krueger: In the year ’42.

00:03:06.503 --> 00:03:07.644
David Boder: In the year ’42.

00:03:07.644 --> 00:03:08.222
Esther Krueger: Yes.

00:03:08.222 --> 00:03:10.035
David Boder: How did they grab for forced labor? How did...

00:03:10.035 --> 00:03:13.706
Esther Krueger: They grabbed for the munitions factory, to Skarzysko.

00:03:13.706 --> 00:03:14.175
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:14.175 --> 00:03:17.550
Esther Krueger: They grabbed [for] forced labor, to munitions.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:18.518
David Boder: Yes. Nu, how was...

00:03:18.518 --> 00:03:19.190
Esther Krueger: At that time...

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.534
David Boder: . . . one grabbed? What happened to you?

00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:24.815
Esther Krueger: At that time a Jewish Community Council was established.

00:03:24.815 --> 00:03:25.502
David Boder: A Community Council, yes.

00:03:25.502 --> 00:03:30.799
Esther Krueger: Yes. A Jewish one. And sent out forced-labor tickets for work.

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:31.580
David Boder: Hm.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.819
Esther Krueger: I, too, was taken to work. But I have...a few times I escaped. I wanted to remain together with my parents.

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:38.256
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:38.256 --> 00:03:41.272
Esther Krueger: So I was taken forcibly by the police, the Jewish [police].

00:03:41.272 --> 00:03:42.568
David Boder: By the Jewish police.

00:03:42.568 --> 00:03:43.146
Esther Krueger: Police.

00:03:43.146 --> 00:03:48.489
David Boder: And so when you were at forced labor did you work and return home every day?

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:54.395
Esther Krueger: Yes. Everyday we drove [to work] at seven o’clock and returned home at five o’clock.

00:03:54.395 --> 00:03:54.739
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.973
Esther Krueger: For a certain time, maybe two months, I worked thus.

00:03:56.973 --> 00:03:57.504
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:57.504 --> 00:04:03.347
Esther Krueger: And then it was said that there is to be a resettlement [population removal].

00:04:03.347 --> 00:04:10.269
David Boder: Aha. Nu, go on. And so, [let’s go] on. How did the deportation come off? Tell about everything in detail. Nu?

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:24.378
Esther Krueger: I got up in the morning and said good bye to my mutti. Afterwards I didn’t want to go to work, but my mutti was crying very much. If I don’t go to work then I will be kept in the barracks.

00:04:24.378 --> 00:04:24.972
David Boder: Hm.

00:04:24.972 --> 00:04:26.174
Esther Krueger: So I had to go to work.

00:04:26.174 --> 00:04:30.330
David Boder: Now wait a moment. Where? In which barracks? Was your mother already in the barracks?

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.627
Esther Krueger: No. My mutti was at home.

00:04:32.627 --> 00:04:33.768
David Boder: Yes? Did...

00:04:33.768 --> 00:04:34.127
Esther Krueger: But...

00:04:34.127 --> 00:04:35.284
David Boder: . . . people knew that the deportation was coming?

00:04:35.284 --> 00:04:37.784
Esther Krueger: We did not know exactly.

00:04:37.784 --> 00:04:38.237
David Boder: Hm.

00:04:38.237 --> 00:04:45.612
Esther Krueger: People in town were talking. Today will be a deportation. And when the deportation was about to be, then the block [the workers] were detained in the barracks.

00:04:45.612 --> 00:04:46.471
David Boder: Hm.

00:04:46.471 --> 00:04:48.190
Esther Krueger: So I became afraid to go to work.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.924
David Boder: Yes?

00:04:48.924 --> 00:04:54.143
Esther Krueger: But my mother said, ‘Don’t be afraid. Today they will not [?] detain in the barracks.’ And I went to work.

00:04:54.143 --> 00:04:55.111
David Boder: Hm.

00:04:55.111 --> 00:04:58.955
Esther Krueger: And when I went to work on the same day they detained us.

00:04:58.955 --> 00:04:59.689
David Boder: Whom?

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:01.548
Esther Krueger: Us. All the girls [words not clear].

00:05:01.548 --> 00:05:02.673
David Boder: Oh, the girls who were...

00:05:02.673 --> 00:05:03.235
Esther Krueger: Yes.

00:05:03.235 --> 00:05:03.798
David Boder: . . . at work.

00:05:03.798 --> 00:05:04.173
Esther Krueger: At work.

00:05:04.173 --> 00:05:06.376
David Boder: Oh, you were kept back at work. Nu?

00:05:06.376 --> 00:05:09.001
Esther Krueger: Kept us back in the barracks. Did [not] let any more [go] home.

00:05:09.001 --> 00:05:09.813
David Boder: Hm.

00:05:09.813 --> 00:05:12.966
Esther Krueger: Because every day at five o’clock we came home

00:05:12.966 --> 00:05:13.341
David Boder: Yes?

00:05:13.341 --> 00:05:15.760
Esther Krueger: But this day they did not let us go home any more.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.272
David Boder: Where was that barrack? Near the factory?

00:05:19.272 --> 00:05:22.019
Esther Krueger: The barrack was in...near the factory.

00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:22.487
David Boder: Aha.

00:05:22.487 --> 00:05:23.298
Esther Krueger: In Skarzysko.

00:05:23.298 --> 00:05:24.187
David Boder: Aha. Nu.

00:05:24.187 --> 00:05:31.258
Esther Krueger: And afterwards I have seen the worst. And I imagined that I am being left alone without my parents.

00:05:31.258 --> 00:05:31.695
David Boder: Hm.

00:05:31.695 --> 00:05:41.989
Esther Krueger: I cried very much. I cried so much I then received from an SS man in the face that I...I couldn’t hear, on my ear.

00:05:41.989 --> 00:05:43.207
David Boder: What does it mean ‘you received’?

00:05:43.207 --> 00:05:43.972
Esther Krueger: Received such a...a...

00:05:43.972 --> 00:05:45.610
David Boder: Slap in the face. He hit you in the face.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.015
Esther Krueger: Yes, yes.

00:05:47.015 --> 00:05:47.389
David Boder: Nu?

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.803
Esther Krueger: I did not feel well then, but I still could not control my crying.

00:05:49.803 --> 00:05:50.271
David Boder: Hm.

00:05:50.271 --> 00:05:54.969
Esther Krueger: Because this was the worst that could happen in life.

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:55.937
David Boder: What?

00:05:55.937 --> 00:05:58.022
Esther Krueger: To be left without parents, without sisters and brothers.

00:05:58.022 --> 00:05:58.600
David Boder: Nu?

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:09.994
Esther Krueger: But that didn’t do [help] anything. I had to remain in the barrack. And my parents were still at home for perhaps four weeks.

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:13.100
David Boder: Yes. And where did you remain? In the barrack for those four weeks?

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:22.172
Esther Krueger: And I remained in the barrack, and later on I received letters from home. I also wrote, through Poles.

00:06:22.172 --> 00:06:22.640
David Boder: Hm.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:35.971
Esther Krueger: And my mutti wrote me that the deportation was put off for three months. But it was not true. My mutti wrote [it] in order that I should not have so many...eh...

00:06:35.971 --> 00:06:36.877
David Boder: Worries?

00:06:36.877 --> 00:06:37.470
Esther Krueger: Worries.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:38.126
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:38.126 --> 00:06:40.407
Esther Krueger: And afterwards...

00:06:40.407 --> 00:06:41.922
David Boder: Did your mother write through the mail?

00:06:41.922 --> 00:06:44.983
Esther Krueger: The mail, yes. Through...through Poles.

00:06:44.983 --> 00:06:47.419
David Boder: Yes. And so one was not supposed to receive letters.

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:48.418
Esther Krueger: Pardon?

00:06:48.418 --> 00:06:50.136
David Boder: They didn’t allow to receive letters.

00:06:50.136 --> 00:06:51.667
Esther Krueger: Did not allow. No.

00:06:51.667 --> 00:06:52.823
David Boder: No.

00:06:52.823 --> 00:06:53.448
Esther Krueger: It wasn’t allowed.

00:06:53.448 --> 00:06:54.788
David Boder: But they were sent through the Polish clandestine ‘post.’

00:06:54.788 --> 00:06:56.819
Esther Krueger: Yes. They would bring it into the lager.

00:06:56.819 --> 00:06:57.584
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:06:57.584 --> 00:07:00.708
Esther Krueger: And afterwards was Yom Kippur [ Day of Atonement].

00:07:00.708 --> 00:07:01.114
David Boder: Yes?

00:07:01.114 --> 00:07:05.254
Esther Krueger: I had also written how a paper a day earlier.

00:07:05.254 --> 00:07:05.582
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:05.582 --> 00:07:15.480
Esther Krueger: And I was supposed to receive a letter a day the next day. The Poles came and they said that they could not get a letter any more because all had been deported.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.464
David Boder: On Yom Kippur?

00:07:16.464 --> 00:07:18.260
Esther Krueger: On Yom Kippur. On the same day.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.792
David Boder: Hm.

00:07:18.792 --> 00:07:21.900
Esther Krueger: At dawn, at three o’clock at night, they were awakened.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:22.463
David Boder: Hm.

00:07:22.463 --> 00:07:28.509
Esther Krueger: And mutti had to get up with the small children, take everything, and leave the house.

00:07:28.509 --> 00:07:35.375
David Boder: And so did people still go to Synagogue on Yom Kippur in the evening? Did people still go to Kol Nidrei [special services for the Day of Atonement]?

00:07:35.375 --> 00:07:41.297
Esther Krueger: Yes. They still had gone in the evening. And they came home. And they did not know anything.

00:07:41.297 --> 00:07:41.703
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:41.703 --> 00:07:46.234
Esther Krueger: At three o’clock came that deportation.

00:07:46.234 --> 00:07:50.421
David Boder: Yes. Who were...and how old were the small children?

00:07:50.421 --> 00:07:53.936
Esther Krueger: The youngest, my sister, was four years [old].

00:07:53.936 --> 00:07:56.233
David Boder: And your father was also taken?

00:07:56.233 --> 00:08:03.233
Esther Krueger: My father too, was in a larger, but on another shop. I was in shop ‘B’ and my father was in Shop ‘A’.

00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:04.905
David Boder: Oh, already from before.

00:08:04.905 --> 00:08:15.624
Esther Krueger: Before. But I didn’t know about my father. I was told that my father had gone home because my [his] eyes had become weak. I was very happy because my father will be...

00:08:15.624 --> 00:08:16.827
David Boder: Whose eyes became weak.

00:08:16.827 --> 00:08:17.577
Esther Krueger: . . . together. Yes.

00:08:17.577 --> 00:08:17.874
David Boder: And?

00:08:17.874 --> 00:08:18.593
Esther Krueger: With my mutti.

00:08:18.593 --> 00:08:19.702
David Boder: Yes. Was it so?

00:08:19.702 --> 00:08:33.601
Esther Krueger: No. I wrote home. My mutti did not answer me anything about the father. And afterwards, a year later, I was told that my father had died in the hospital before the deportation of Skarzysko.

00:08:33.601 --> 00:08:36.851
David Boder: Hm. And so your father was also taken to a barrack?

00:08:36.851 --> 00:08:37.538
Esther Krueger: Yes.

00:08:37.538 --> 00:08:38.069
David Boder: Hm.

00:08:38.069 --> 00:08:40.991
Esther Krueger: My father was also in the barrack, but he was working on wood.

00:08:40.991 --> 00:08:42.194
David Boder: How old was he?

00:08:42.194 --> 00:08:44.272
Esther Krueger: My father was forty-one years.

00:08:44.272 --> 00:08:45.538
David Boder: Forty-one years?

00:08:45.538 --> 00:08:45.944
Esther Krueger: Forty-one years.

00:08:45.944 --> 00:08:46.444
David Boder: Yes.

00:08:46.444 --> 00:08:53.703
Esther Krueger: Yes. My father was working on wood in the Karl [?] forest, and a big tree fell on [his] leg and my father was...

00:08:53.703 --> 00:08:55.563
David Boder: A big what? A big tree.

00:08:55.563 --> 00:08:56.126
Esther Krueger: Tree. Yes.

00:08:56.126 --> 00:08:56.595
David Boder: Yes.

00:08:56.595 --> 00:08:58.783
Esther Krueger: Fell on [his] leg and it broke my father’s leg.

00:08:58.783 --> 00:08:59.564
David Boder: Hm.

00:08:59.564 --> 00:09:03.814
Esther Krueger: Then the father went to the hospital, and he died

00:09:03.814 --> 00:09:10.877
David Boder: Hm. Nu? And so what happened on Yom Kippur night? You were not there. You had been told.

00:09:10.877 --> 00:09:11.236
Esther Krueger: No.

00:09:11.236 --> 00:09:11.877
David Boder: What were you told?

00:09:11.877 --> 00:09:23.832
Esther Krueger: I was told thus. When my mutti and my brothers had gone to Kol Nidrei, they came home. They knew nothing. They went to sleep as any other day.

00:09:23.832 --> 00:09:25.222
David Boder: Was there a ghetto?

00:09:25.222 --> 00:09:27.597
Esther Krueger: It had been partitioned off.

00:09:27.597 --> 00:09:28.691
David Boder: Yes. It had been partitioned off.

00:09:28.691 --> 00:09:29.050
Esther Krueger: Yes.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:29.472
David Boder: In Kielce.

00:09:29.472 --> 00:09:30.222
Esther Krueger: Yes.

00:09:30.222 --> 00:09:30.753
David Boder: Nu.

00:09:30.753 --> 00:09:51.705
Esther Krueger: And later on, at three o’clock, the Jewish police came, and they began waking. My mutti didn’t know what was happening, what was going on, but she understood that it must be already....there had arrived SS men, and they sur...surrounded the whole town with SS men.

00:09:51.705 --> 00:09:55.158
David Boder: Who were those SS men? Germans or Ukrainians?

00:09:55.158 --> 00:10:15.088
Esther Krueger: There were Germans and there were Ukrainians, too, but mostly Germans. They badly beat the Jews. The worst that could happen. Without any distinction whether a woman or a man, they would beat badly. And my mutti arose, got up the children, and left the house, at about six o’clock. That is what I heard. I don’t know it exactly.

00:10:15.088 --> 00:10:15.869
David Boder: Yes.

00:10:15.869 --> 00:10:27.615
Esther Krueger: Around six o’clock they led them to the train, and they shipped them away, in closed wagons [railroad cars], lime spread inside [word not clear]. They received no water.

00:10:27.615 --> 00:10:30.021
David Boder: Nu, yes. You didn’t see that yourself.

00:10:30.021 --> 00:10:30.989
Esther Krueger: I heard about all that.

00:10:30.989 --> 00:10:34.645
David Boder: Yes. That we already have from the others. Nu, what happened to you?

00:10:34.645 --> 00:10:38.614
Esther Krueger: And I remained in the lager. At that time I didn’t know anything any more.

00:10:38.614 --> 00:10:39.302
David Boder: In the barracks?

00:10:39.302 --> 00:10:53.818
Esther Krueger: In the barracks, yes. I didn’t know anything any more, what will be with my life, whether I will survive, or if it will be the end of me. But I worked at machines. I worked very diligently so I got a good eye [fell in favor] by the German foreman.

00:10:53.818 --> 00:10:54.537
David Boder: A what?

00:10:54.537 --> 00:10:57.553
Esther Krueger: By the German foreman I got a good eye. I worked well.

00:10:57.553 --> 00:10:58.147
David Boder: A good eye?

00:10:58.147 --> 00:10:58.428
Esther Krueger: Yes.

00:10:58.428 --> 00:11:00.053
David Boder: By him. Nu?

00:11:00.053 --> 00:11:03.459
Esther Krueger: And I worked by a brush machine.

00:11:03.459 --> 00:11:06.381
David Boder: What did they do? What did...

00:11:06.381 --> 00:11:09.492
Esther Krueger: The brush machines shined the shells.

00:11:09.492 --> 00:11:10.648
David Boder: Yes, the ammunition shells.

00:11:10.648 --> 00:11:22.835
Esther Krueger: The ammunition shells. And afterwards I was given more soup. The most important thing in the lager was to keep oneself clean. Always clean, ne to keep oneself, and too take care of the work.

00:11:22.835 --> 00:11:23.320
David Boder: Hm.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:40.226
Esther Krueger: And all that was by me in order. I conducted myself very well. Clean. I have...we received [for every] seven people a kilo ninety (1.90) of bread. So I had to, together with my friend — I had one girl from home for a friend — [we] had to sell one portion of bread.

00:11:40.226 --> 00:11:40.820
David Boder: Yes?

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.414
Esther Krueger: For that to buy soap.

00:11:42.414 --> 00:11:42.914
David Boder: What kind...

00:11:42.914 --> 00:11:43.352
Esther Krueger: For washing.

00:11:43.352 --> 00:11:46.977
David Boder: What kind of bread was it. Was it baked every day?

00:11:46.977 --> 00:11:52.645
Esther Krueger: It was so: Some days it night be fresh, but it could be moldy, too.

00:11:52.645 --> 00:11:53.270
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:54.879
Esther Krueger: Old bread.

00:11:54.879 --> 00:11:55.941
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:55.941 --> 00:11:56.941
Esther Krueger: It varied. So we...

00:11:56.941 --> 00:11:58.128
David Boder: So you sold the bread to buy soap.

00:11:58.128 --> 00:12:00.923
Esther Krueger: So we sold one portion of bread, two people [men] to buy soap.

00:12:00.923 --> 00:12:02.782
David Boder: You mean two women.

00:12:02.782 --> 00:12:03.188
Esther Krueger: Two.

00:12:03.188 --> 00:12:04.000
David Boder: Two girls. [Chuckle.] Yes.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.781
Esther Krueger: Yes, two girls. And one portion of bread we ate.

00:12:04.781 --> 00:12:05.187
David Boder: Hm.

00:12:05.187 --> 00:12:29.663
Esther Krueger: Everyday. We received the bread in the evening. We were very hungry, so we ate it in the evening. And in the morning we had to wait till twelve o’clock till dinner. The dinner varied. One day there was plain water. The next day might be already a little pea soup or a little potatoes. The soup varied.

00:12:29.663 --> 00:12:31.818
David Boder: Did they give bread for dinner again?

00:12:31.818 --> 00:12:33.317
Esther Krueger: [With emphasis] No. For dinner...

00:12:33.317 --> 00:12:35.332
David Boder: The bread was given once for a whole day

00:12:35.332 --> 00:12:45.552
Esther Krueger: . . . they didn’t give us any more bread. In the evening we received bread for the whole day. And twice a day we...and twice a week we received marmalade with the bread.

00:12:45.552 --> 00:12:46.176
David Boder: Hm.

00:12:46.176 --> 00:12:55.213
Esther Krueger: One spoon of marmalade. And thus we lived all that time, a year and a half, in Shop ‘B.’ And then...

00:12:55.213 --> 00:12:56.915
David Boder: In shop what?

00:12:56.915 --> 00:13:03.473
Esther Krueger: Shop ‘B’ It was...Skarzysko had three shops, Shop ‘A’, Shop ‘B’ and Shop ‘C.’

00:13:03.473 --> 00:13:04.831
David Boder: Hm. And you lived in Shop ‘B.’

00:13:04.831 --> 00:13:05.440
Esther Krueger: Shop ‘B.’

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:05.893
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:05.893 --> 00:13:14.050
Esther Krueger: The worst shop was Shop ‘C.’ People worked with ‘Pikrina’ at ‘yellow labor.’ [Note: On work ‘C’ two ingredients were used in the manufacturing or ammunition: ‘Trotyl’ and ‘Pikrina.’ From these substances people were covered with bright yellow pigment. They were named ‘canaries,’ hence the ‘yellow labor.’ B.W.] From this work many people died.

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:15.081
David Boder: What sort of labor?

00:13:15.081 --> 00:13:17.205
Esther Krueger: ‘Pikrina.’ This is such a ‘yellow labor.’

00:13:17.205 --> 00:13:18.455
David Boder: What does that mean?

00:13:18.455 --> 00:13:21.329
Esther Krueger: That is such a yellow...from which ammunition is manufactured.

00:13:21.329 --> 00:13:22.485
David Boder: Shells?.

00:13:22.485 --> 00:13:25.565
Esther Krueger: Such a yellow labor. Yellow. A man immediately become yellow from the work

00:13:25.565 --> 00:13:27.033
David Boder: Oh, one become yellow...

00:13:27.033 --> 00:13:27.486
Esther Krueger: Yes.

00:13:27.486 --> 00:13:29.454
David Boder: . . . from that work. What sort of work is it that one becomes yellow?

00:13:29.454 --> 00:13:32.312
Esther Krueger: I didn’t work at that. I was in the second shop.

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:32.890
David Boder: Hm.

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:34.936
Esther Krueger: But I saw the people who were so yellow.

00:13:34.936 --> 00:13:35.811
David Boder: Aha. Nu.

00:13:35.811 --> 00:13:49.335
Esther Krueger: And our shop was not the worst, but the German foreman of our work were the worst. There was foreman Herrick. Every day he used to beat Jews to death. Many Jews did he kill. Every two...

00:13:49.335 --> 00:13:51.382
David Boder: Did he really beat to death?

00:13:51.382 --> 00:13:58.671
Esther Krueger: [With Emphasis] Beat to death. When a Jew didn’t do something right by the machines, perhaps he made sabotage, they called it sabotage.

00:13:58.671 --> 00:13:59.249
David Boder: Yes?

00:13:59.249 --> 00:14:06.149
Esther Krueger: He didn’t do it on purpose. He [ the foreman] would come running, and he would kick him so hard in the stomach that his guts would drop down.

00:14:06.149 --> 00:14:07.977
David Boder: One moment. With what did he do that?

00:14:07.977 --> 00:14:08.446
Esther Krueger: Pardon?

00:14:08.446 --> 00:14:09.821
David Boder: With what did he do that?

00:14:09.821 --> 00:14:11.102
Esther Krueger: With the foot. With the boots.

00:14:11.102 --> 00:14:11.477
David Boder: With the foot.

00:14:11.477 --> 00:14:11.884
Esther Krueger: Yes.

00:14:11.884 --> 00:14:12.384
David Boder: With the boots.

00:14:12.384 --> 00:14:17.699
Esther Krueger: He would kick him so hard [his] guts would drop down, and then the person dropped. He would live perhaps another three or four days.

00:14:17.699 --> 00:14:18.402
David Boder: And...

00:14:18.402 --> 00:14:19.121
Esther Krueger: Then he died.

00:14:19.121 --> 00:14:19.965
David Boder: Hm.

00:14:19.965 --> 00:14:31.651
Esther Krueger: And besides these things, also every two weeks there were also...eh...in Polish it is...what is called...

00:14:31.651 --> 00:14:32.808
David Boder: Say it in Polish.

00:14:32.808 --> 00:14:35.386
Esther Krueger: Eh...Przebiurki [selections].

00:14:35.386 --> 00:14:36.230
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:38.195
Esther Krueger: Every two weeks the people were re-sorted.

00:14:38.195 --> 00:14:39.132
David Boder: Hm. Selection.

00:14:39.132 --> 00:14:43.304
Esther Krueger: There were selections every two weeks. They were taken into the woods and shot.

00:14:43.304 --> 00:14:44.882
David Boder: Right there?

00:14:44.882 --> 00:14:46.492
Esther Krueger: Yes, right in Shop ‘B’

00:14:46.492 --> 00:14:47.398
David Boder: Who saw it?

00:14:47.398 --> 00:14:56.264
Esther Krueger: Many Jews saw it. When the two weeks came, he said, ‘These, these,’ because maybe she would look bad...

00:14:56.264 --> 00:14:56.795
David Boder: Aha.

00:14:56.795 --> 00:15:03.366
Esther Krueger: . . . or perhaps she wasn’t dressed so nicely. Their numbers were written down, because everyone had her [own] number...

00:15:03.366 --> 00:15:03.804
David Boder: Yes?

00:15:03.804 --> 00:15:22.489
Esther Krueger: . . . and written down by names. They all knew that she is being taken into the woods to death. When there came the third day, there they came, the Jewish police, and said, ‘This name, this name,’ and they all would be reported. They would say good bye to the rest of the Jews and were led into the forest.

00:15:22.489 --> 00:15:24.755
David Boder: What did the Jewish police do there?

00:15:24.755 --> 00:15:29.322
Esther Krueger: There had to be Jewish police to lead out the Jews to work, to the factory...

00:15:29.322 --> 00:15:29.728
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:29.728 --> 00:15:31.368
Esther Krueger: . . . and led them back in the evening...

00:15:31.368 --> 00:15:31.868
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:31.868 --> 00:15:34.368
Esther Krueger: . . . so that no Jew should escape from the lager.

00:15:34.368 --> 00:15:38.118
David Boder: Yes? Nu, what did the Jewish police have to do with the shootings?

00:15:38.118 --> 00:15:43.712
Esther Krueger: The Jewish police didn’t shoot. They would take the Jews and lead them over, with the shop guards, the Ukranians...

00:15:43.712 --> 00:15:44.400
David Boder: Yes?

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.335
Esther Krueger: . . . and would lead them into the forest, and afterwards we...

00:15:46.335 --> 00:15:48.007
David Boder: The Jewish police had to do it?

00:15:48.007 --> 00:15:51.476
Esther Krueger: Yes. Then the Ukranians took over those Jews and shot them all.

00:15:51.476 --> 00:15:52.288
David Boder: Hm.

00:15:52.288 --> 00:15:53.319
Esther Krueger: We could here the shots and later...

00:15:53.319 --> 00:15:54.554
David Boder: You did hear the shots?

00:15:54.554 --> 00:16:00.539
Esther Krueger: We heard it in the barracks. It was not far from our barracks. And afterwards they did not return any more.

00:16:00.539 --> 00:16:07.055
David Boder: Hm. And what does it mean ‘look nice,’ ‘dressed nicely’? Did you have your own clothing? Were you able to dress nicely?

00:16:07.055 --> 00:16:12.393
Esther Krueger: We had to [see] that the clothes which we did have should not be torn, dirty.

00:16:12.393 --> 00:16:12.877
David Boder: Hm.

00:16:12.877 --> 00:16:16.471
Esther Krueger: And a few, from hunger, could not keep themselves so...

00:16:16.471 --> 00:16:17.096
David Boder: Yes.

00:16:17.096 --> 00:16:17.628
Esther Krueger: . . . clean

00:16:17.628 --> 00:16:17.941
David Boder: Yes.

00:16:17.941 --> 00:16:29.926
Esther Krueger: They neglected themselves because they were badly starved. And I...I have...I was already so used to it, and I only...because I knew that in the first place one has to keep clean.

00:16:29.926 --> 00:16:31.051
David Boder: One moment.

00:16:31.051 --> 00:16:32.660
Esther Krueger: But not all were able to keep themselves so.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:17:14.190
David Boder: [In English] Esther is chubby, good looking, now plump and young girl of twenty. She is not understanding what I am saying. And I caught her...I got her in interrupting her on the way towards washing, and she has put down here on the table a piece of soap. She was going to do either some washing, to groom herself, or to wash some....to do some laundry. She is very well groomed. There is no rouge or anything, but she has a very healthy and pleasant look. [In German] Well, go on. Did you understand what I said? No. [Chuckle. Words not clear.] Go on. [In English] Her teeth are exceptionally good. [In German] You have very nice teeth.

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:15.283
Esther Krueger: [Words not clear.]

00:17:15.283 --> 00:17:17.815
David Boder: Nu, yes [words not clear]. Go on.

00:17:17.815 --> 00:17:20.159
Esther Krueger: [Whispers. Sounds like] I was in the hospital.

00:17:20.159 --> 00:17:21.378
David Boder: And so they were shot.

00:17:21.378 --> 00:17:21.752
Esther Krueger: Yes.

00:17:21.752 --> 00:17:22.284
David Boder: The girls.

00:17:22.284 --> 00:17:33.900
Esther Krueger: It could happen also many times that a girl would be cooking some soup for herself. She had received a few potatoes. She would take from the mill...there was a mill for flakes. From these flakes soup would be made. [Note: On Shop ‘B’ was a mill in which potato flakes were made. Occasionally these flakes were used to thicken the soup of the lager. B.W.]

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:34.525
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:34.525 --> 00:17:42.562
Esther Krueger: She would take a few potatoes, and she would cook a soup. She didn’t know a thing. She [her name] had been written down, but she didn’t know which day she would be called to death.

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:43.124
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:43.124 --> 00:17:44.764
Esther Krueger: And while cooking...

00:17:44.764 --> 00:17:46.909
David Boder: Where did you cook? Eh...where did she cook the soup?

00:17:46.909 --> 00:17:53.096
Esther Krueger: Yes. By us in the barracks there were in the winter....We had small stoves for heating...

00:17:53.096 --> 00:17:53.439
David Boder: Yes?

00:17:53.439 --> 00:17:54.939
Esther Krueger: . . . so that it shouldn’t be so cold.

00:17:54.939 --> 00:17:56.236
David Boder: Hm. Nu, go on.

00:17:56.236 --> 00:18:17.822
Esther Krueger: So we could cook. So she was cooking that little soup, and she didn’t know anything. In that moment comes in a Jewish policeman and says the [her] name. She had to leave behind the soup. She knew that soup she will not eat any more. It is not for her any more. She said good bye, and she had to leave everything. She knew exactly that it is to death, but she had no way out.

00:18:17.822 --> 00:18:18.415
David Boder: Hm.

00:18:18.415 --> 00:18:26.510
Esther Krueger: There had also happened a few times that the Jewish boys would fight with the police. When they were going to be taken into the wood, they would...

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:27.947
David Boder: With the Jewish police?

00:18:27.947 --> 00:18:44.097
Esther Krueger: With the Jewish police. They didn’t want to go , but the Jewish police couldn’t help anything. When the SS man said, ‘You are to bring these and these people,’ they had to bring them immediately. And those boys knew that they are going to death anyway, so they didn’t want to go. So several times they fought with the Jewish...

00:18:44.097 --> 00:18:47.283
David Boder: Did the Jewish police have revolvers, rifles?

00:18:47.283 --> 00:18:52.562
Esther Krueger: No. They had nothing whatsoever. But a piece...so...

00:18:52.562 --> 00:18:53.187
David Boder: Stick.

00:18:53.187 --> 00:18:54.436
Esther Krueger: A stick. Nothing more.

00:18:54.436 --> 00:18:55.248
David Boder: Hm.

00:18:55.248 --> 00:19:42.989
Esther Krueger: And so it was. Thus we were living, that was all. We didn’t know how long we would live. And the time could have come when I, too, will be picked out for death. But I didn’t make anything of it. I already knew, parents I didn’t have, sisters and brothers neither. From the family nobody remained but I alone. So I didn’t make anything of it. If to death, then to death. But today [then] I live and what will happen tomorrow, I knew nothing. Later on Shop ‘B’ was transferred to Shop ‘A,’ also in Skarzysko. And I remained in Shop ‘A.’ Shop ‘A’ was much better because we could...I had learned to knit.

00:19:42.989 --> 00:19:44.348
David Boder: Hm.

00:19:44.348 --> 00:19:48.379
Esther Krueger: Handwork. Socks and mittens

00:19:48.379 --> 00:19:48.910
David Boder: Gloves.

00:19:48.910 --> 00:20:02.839
Esther Krueger: Gloves, yes. I earned a little and was already able to buy an additional piece of bread and make a dress or to make something over, and I could buy soap. I didn’t have to sell the portion of bread anymore. And...

00:20:02.839 --> 00:20:09.390
David Boder: And so you had learned to knit in your spare time, not in the fact-...factory you didn’t knit.

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:12.483
Esther Krueger: I had learned to knit in the barracks.

00:20:12.483 --> 00:20:12.936
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:12.936 --> 00:20:18.576
Esther Krueger: When I came from work at seven o’clock I learned knitting till nine o’clock, two hours.

00:20:18.576 --> 00:20:23.542
David Boder: Did the Germans allow [one] to bring in wool or such things?

00:20:23.542 --> 00:20:25.291
Esther Krueger: This the Germans didn’t know.

00:20:25.291 --> 00:20:25.728
David Boder: Hm.

00:20:25.728 --> 00:20:36.207
Esther Krueger: The Germans only watched at work in the factory, but when we returned home we were guarded just by...[from] the first day we were guarded by Jewish police.

00:20:36.207 --> 00:20:37.082
David Boder: Men or women?

00:20:37.082 --> 00:20:38.504
Esther Krueger: Men. Only men.

00:20:38.504 --> 00:20:39.785
David Boder: Yes. And later on

00:20:39.785 --> 00:20:53.037
Esther Krueger: And later on I learned to knit. I would...with my...with my comrade, that girl, too, thus earn. And thus I lived the whole time. I was also in the shop.

00:20:53.037 --> 00:20:54.474
David Boder: Did they pay for the work?

00:20:54.474 --> 00:21:02.389
Esther Krueger: Yes. For the work we would receive from the others [other prisoners?] bread or we would get money, Polish money.

00:21:02.389 --> 00:21:05.562
David Boder: No, no. I mean for the work in the factory. Did they pay?

00:21:05.562 --> 00:21:11.874
Esther Krueger: No. For the work in the factory we didn’t get anything. We prayed for only one thing, [that] we should remain alive from the work.

00:21:11.874 --> 00:21:12.608
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:12.608 --> 00:21:13.139
Esther Krueger: Nothing more.

00:21:13.139 --> 00:21:15.732
David Boder: Nu. And so you had learned to knit.

00:21:15.732 --> 00:21:29.402
Esther Krueger: And later on we learned to knit. When I already knew how to knit, I earned a little. I already had for soap to make some clothing, and I was able to buy an additional piece of bread.

00:21:29.402 --> 00:21:30.089
David Boder: Nu?

00:21:30.089 --> 00:21:32.339
Esther Krueger: And then...

00:21:32.339 --> 00:21:35.308
David Boder: Where did you buy the bread?

00:21:35.308 --> 00:21:47.338
Esther Krueger: The bread was brought by the...the Poles. They brought it for themselves. They would bring it so that the Germans would not know, and they sold it to us for much more money than it cost in town.

00:21:47.338 --> 00:21:49.650
David Boder: What would you pay with, money or things?

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:58.150
Esther Krueger: We would pay in money and things. Whoever had money gave money, and whoever had things from home paid with things.

00:21:58.150 --> 00:21:58.759
David Boder: Hm.

00:21:58.759 --> 00:22:03.915
Esther Krueger: I also had things from home. Then I became sick with spotted typhus.

00:22:03.915 --> 00:22:04.821
David Boder: Spotted typhus.

00:22:04.821 --> 00:22:05.165
Esther Krueger: Spotted typhus.

00:22:05.165 --> 00:22:06.430
David Boder: Did you have lice?

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:24.991
Esther Krueger: No. [Note: Skarzysko was crawling with lice. B.W.] It was so: When one had it [typhus], and then got it from hunger or from filth, and the next one...My girl friend became sick with spotted typhus, and then I got it, because I was helping her very much. I accompanied her to the bath. I comber her. So I took all that over from her.

00:22:24.991 --> 00:22:26.116
David Boder: Did she have lice?

00:22:26.116 --> 00:22:41.381
Esther Krueger: Of course. When she got spotted typhus she was in the hospital. And I had to go to work. I didn’t have the time to be with her all day, because I had to be at work. And she couldn’t wash herself. I had to wash her.

00:22:41.381 --> 00:22:41.975
David Boder: In the hospital?

00:22:41.975 --> 00:22:46.053
Esther Krueger: In the hospital. Before, [when] she was lying in the barrack, then in the hospital.

00:22:46.053 --> 00:22:49.069
David Boder: And where did you wash her? When she was in the hospital or when she...

00:22:49.069 --> 00:22:54.506
Esther Krueger: When she was in the barrack I washed her. And then she was taken to the hospital, to the second shop.

00:22:54.506 --> 00:22:55.506
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:55.506 --> 00:23:25.708
Esther Krueger: And I came to...to her, to the hospital, also. I was already sick. I had a forty degree fever. I came to her, to the hospital. She couldn’t recognize me. She had such high fever that she didn’t know anything. Off her mind. She knew nothing. She recognized me. She thought that I came to wash her. She started screaming, ‘Esther, wash me.’ But I fell on the bad from the bad fever.

00:23:25.708 --> 00:23:29.833
David Boder: Did you sleep together with that girl in the barrack, or did you have separate beds?

00:23:29.833 --> 00:23:35.239
Esther Krueger: No. In the barrack we slept together, two people [to a bed]. I slept with her.

00:23:35.239 --> 00:23:36.177
David Boder: Hm.

00:23:36.177 --> 00:23:37.021
Esther Krueger: And...

00:23:37.021 --> 00:23:37.896
David Boder: How was it, in one bed, or how?

00:23:37.896 --> 00:23:40.036
Esther Krueger: In one bed, such plank beds.

00:23:40.036 --> 00:23:40.504
David Boder: Yes?

00:23:40.504 --> 00:23:43.113
Esther Krueger: Tierred, or two-tierred.

00:23:43.113 --> 00:23:43.488
David Boder: Yes

00:23:43.488 --> 00:23:45.409
Esther Krueger: And in one bed two people slept.

00:23:45.409 --> 00:23:47.393
David Boder: Yes. Two women.

00:23:47.393 --> 00:23:53.033
Esther Krueger: Yes. And in the hospital there slept already ten people on one bunk.

00:23:53.033 --> 00:23:53.893
David Boder: On one bunk.

00:23:53.893 --> 00:23:55.658
Esther Krueger: On one bunk ten people. And...

00:23:55.658 --> 00:23:58.407
David Boder: How wide...how large was the bunk?

00:23:58.407 --> 00:24:01.391
Esther Krueger: That bunk might have been ten meters [wide].

00:24:01.391 --> 00:24:02.251
David Boder: Yes.

00:24:02.251 --> 00:24:16.875
Esther Krueger: The number of people varied. I had in the hospital a separate bed, because when my girl friend came, there was one bed, so she slept [on it]. When she became well, then I...that bed remained for me. Then I slept in that bed.

00:24:16.875 --> 00:24:19.218
David Boder: Did people otherwise sleep in the hospital two in a bed?

00:24:19.218 --> 00:24:23.405
Esther Krueger: Yes. In the hospital people slept five, six in the bed then.

00:24:23.405 --> 00:24:25.905
David Boder: Well, and who were the doctors?

00:24:25.905 --> 00:24:39.779
Esther Krueger: There were also Jewish orderlies and doctors. There were two or three doctors, also Jewish. And every few days there were controls by Germans. They picked out many for death.

00:24:39.779 --> 00:24:41.154
David Boder: What does that mean?

00:24:41.154 --> 00:24:53.031
Esther Krueger: When the sick one lay there five days or six, the Germans said he is not recoverable any more. Immediately [they wrote] wrote down [his name] and afterwards an auto came. [He was] taken on the auto, and [he] was driven to the woods and did not return any more.

00:24:53.031 --> 00:24:57.564
David Boder: And so how were they...how were they murdered? Were they shot, or...

00:24:57.564 --> 00:25:02.658
Esther Krueger: That I don’t know any more, because I was in work ‘A’ and they were taken to work ‘C.’

00:25:02.658 --> 00:25:05.221
David Boder: What does it mean ‘they were taken to work ‘C?’

00:25:05.221 --> 00:25:07.158
Esther Krueger: That was another shop in Skarzysko.

00:25:07.158 --> 00:25:10.105
David Boder: Yes, but you were in the hospital, in the sick ward. Were those people.

00:25:10.105 --> 00:25:10.793
Esther Krueger: Yes.

00:25:10.793 --> 00:25:11.605
David Boder: . . . taken from the hospital?

00:25:11.605 --> 00:25:12.668
Esther Krueger: They were taken alive, and...

00:25:12.668 --> 00:25:14.152
David Boder: And they were brought over where?

00:25:14.152 --> 00:25:16.105
Esther Krueger: Brought over to work ‘C.’

00:25:16.105 --> 00:25:16.464
David Boder: Hm.

00:25:16.464 --> 00:25:17.907
Esther Krueger: And then they didn’t return any more. [Note: On work ‘C’ were the execution grounds and the mass graves. B.W.]

00:25:17.907 --> 00:25:20.800
David Boder: Hm. And so you don’t know if they were given injections, or you don’t know that?

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.472
Esther Krueger: That I know nothing about.

00:25:22.472 --> 00:25:23.754
David Boder: And...

00:25:23.754 --> 00:25:24.520
Esther Krueger: That I have not seen.

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.114
David Boder: Nu.

00:25:25.114 --> 00:25:30.332
Esther Krueger: And later I, too, recovered from typhus.

00:25:30.332 --> 00:25:31.739
David Boder: How long were you in the hospital?

00:25:31.739 --> 00:25:33.911
Esther Krueger: I was in the hospital fourteen days, until...

00:25:33.911 --> 00:25:38.208
David Boder: But you said that one couldn’t be [there] more than five days.

00:25:38.208 --> 00:25:47.145
Esther Krueger: Nu, yes. I couldn’t tell the Germans that I am there so long. When they came I didn’t look so bad, so I said that I am only three days.

00:25:47.145 --> 00:25:48.895
David Boder: And the nurse didn’t tell?

00:25:48.895 --> 00:25:53.099
Esther Krueger: No, the Jewish nurses said, ‘Don’t say more than two, three days.’

00:25:53.099 --> 00:25:53.615
David Boder: Hm.

00:25:53.615 --> 00:26:00.775
Esther Krueger: But when she [a sick girl] looked already very bad, she couldn’t say so, because they could recognize. ‘You look so bad. You are [here] more than three, four days.’

00:26:00.775 --> 00:26:03.603
David Boder: Didn’t the same ones come? Didn’t they recognize you?

00:26:03.603 --> 00:26:09.665
Esther Krueger: No. They didn’t know so well because there were so many, so many sick. There were several hundred sick. They could not recognize.

00:26:09.665 --> 00:26:21.758
David Boder: [In English] We see here that I am trying to give them some searching questions when [it appears that] the horrible story does not make any sense. [In German] Well go on. Yes? So you...in fourteen days you have recovered.

00:26:21.758 --> 00:26:37.814
Esther Krueger: Yes. The crisis had passed, and I recovered. I also sold my clothes that I had from home for...for mush to have something to cook after the sickness. I myself was doing the cooking. I was very weak, but I, myself was doing the cooking.

00:26:37.814 --> 00:26:38.908
David Boder: Nu?

00:26:38.908 --> 00:26:59.485
Esther Krueger: And later on I got well. I went back to work immediately. It was on work ‘A’ one year later, and on work ‘B’ a year and a half. It was already two and a half years. And then the lager
                        Skarzysko was transferred to Czenstokhov.

00:26:59.485 --> 00:27:00.063
David Boder: Yes.

00:27:00.063 --> 00:27:06.734
Esther Krueger: When we heard that the Russians are approaching, the Germans took us, transferred the whole factory to Skar-...to Czenstokhov.

00:27:06.734 --> 00:27:07.405
David Boder: Yes?

00:27:07.405 --> 00:27:08.217
Esther Krueger: Czenstokhov...

00:27:08.217 --> 00:27:09.405
David Boder: How were you transferred?

00:27:09.405 --> 00:27:11.483
Esther Krueger: From Skarzysko to Czenstokhov.

00:27:11.483 --> 00:27:13.343
David Boder: No I mean...

00:27:13.343 --> 00:27:14.014
Esther Krueger: By train.

00:27:14.014 --> 00:27:15.936
David Boder: By train?

00:27:15.936 --> 00:27:17.186
Esther Krueger: Yes, in railroad cards.

00:27:17.186 --> 00:27:18.920
David Boder: How many were loaded in RR-car?

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:22.826
Esther Krueger: In one RR-car were loaded a hundred people, eighty...

00:27:22.826 --> 00:27:23.920
David Boder: A hundred girls, you mean?

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:31.670
Esther Krueger: Yes. A hundred girls and then there were RR-cars for men, because it had been a lager for girls and for...

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:32.295
David Boder: Yes.

00:27:32.295 --> 00:27:32.732
Esther Krueger: . . . men.

00:27:32.732 --> 00:27:33.060
David Boder: Yes.

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:40.229
Esther Krueger: Together. We were traveling, and we were given for the journey a small piece of bread. We were hungry on the journey, but that...

00:27:40.229 --> 00:27:41.729
David Boder: How long did you travel?

00:27:41.729 --> 00:27:43.822
Esther Krueger: We traveled only one day

00:27:43.822 --> 00:27:44.415
David Boder: Hm.

00:27:44.415 --> 00:27:47.305
Esther Krueger: One day and...half a night.

00:27:47.305 --> 00:27:50.008
David Boder: Did they let you out to go to the toilet or where?

00:27:50.008 --> 00:27:53.164
Esther Krueger: [Pause.] No.

00:27:53.164 --> 00:27:54.164
David Boder: When people had to go out?

00:27:54.164 --> 00:27:57.539
Esther Krueger: No. Not at all. Everybody stayed locked in the RR-cars.

00:27:57.539 --> 00:28:00.289
David Boder: And what did people do when they had to go out?

00:28:00.289 --> 00:28:05.969
Esther Krueger: Oh, all that varied. They had pots from...from the lager yet, and they took them for the road.

00:28:05.969 --> 00:28:06.907
David Boder: Hm.

00:28:06.907 --> 00:28:07.845
Esther Krueger: There were no boys...

00:28:07.845 --> 00:28:08.298
David Boder: What?

00:28:08.298 --> 00:28:09.095
Esther Krueger: Only women.

00:28:09.095 --> 00:28:09.642
David Boder: Only women.

00:28:09.642 --> 00:28:31.219
Esther Krueger: Yes. One wasn’t embarassed in front of the other. There was no way out. Then we came to Czenstokhov. We were taken to Warta. In Czenstokhov there were also three works, Czenstokhovianka, Warta, and Pelcery. I remained located in Warta. This is the work where there is the river Warta.

00:28:31.219 --> 00:28:31.969
David Boder: Hm.

00:28:31.969 --> 00:28:53.093
Esther Krueger: We also worked at the same machines as in Skarzysko. It was already much better. We received half a kilo of bread for each person, usually every day in the evening, and a better soup, a thicker one, and much more than in Skarzysko . Life was already much better.

00:28:53.093 --> 00:28:54.092
David Boder: And who was guarding you?

00:28:54.092 --> 00:28:57.326
Esther Krueger: We were guar-...the Germans watched us from all sides.

00:28:57.326 --> 00:28:59.341
David Boder: Were they of the SS or the Wehrmacht?

00:28:59.341 --> 00:29:02.914
Esther Krueger: No. Wehrmacht. And Ukranians, factory guards.

00:29:02.914 --> 00:29:03.977
David Boder: Yes.

00:29:03.977 --> 00:29:13.591
Esther Krueger: And we...life was already much better than in Skarzysko . We already knew that the front is coming closer and closer. Maybe we will be liberated. But we didn’t think...

00:29:13.591 --> 00:29:15.169
David Boder: Did they beat you?

00:29:15.169 --> 00:29:22.450
Esther Krueger: Not that much any more. We didn’t get [beaten] as much as a Skarzysko . They were already much better Germans than in Skarzysko .

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:24.215
David Boder: Which year was that in?

00:29:24.215 --> 00:29:26.668
Esther Krueger: It was in the year ’45.

00:29:26.668 --> 00:29:27.902
David Boder: In the year ’45.

00:29:27.902 --> 00:29:28.246
Esther Krueger: Yes.

00:29:28.246 --> 00:29:28.683
David Boder: Yes.

00:29:28.683 --> 00:29:59.453
Esther Krueger: From ’44 to ’45. It was already towards the end of ’45 [apparently ’44], because we were liberated in the year ’45. And we were living that way in Czenstokhov. Life wasn’t as bad any more as is Skarzysko . We got much more soup to eat, half a kilo of bread, and thus we lived. And then we also knew that the front is coming always closer, and we will be liberated. But we didn’t believe that it is poss-...[a pause apparently due to something wrong with the wire].

00:29:59.453 --> 00:30:00.172
David Boder: Nu?

00:30:00.172 --> 00:30:13.693
Esther Krueger: We didn’t believe that we will live through it, because everybody was saying to all the Jews, ‘If freedom will come at twelve...at twelve o’clock, then at half past eleven the Germans will make an end of all the Jews.

00:30:13.693 --> 00:30:14.349
David Boder: An end.

00:30:14.349 --> 00:30:33.413
Esther Krueger: Yes, an end. Then we didn’t want to believe that we will survive this war. But unexpectedly, [on] Monday it was, the Germans led all the Jews, men, out to Germany. It was on the fifth the first [month].

00:30:33.413 --> 00:30:34.194
David Boder: Yes.

00:30:34.194 --> 00:32:39.425
Esther Krueger: And on Tuesday, on the second day, they were supposed to lead away all the women. They locked us in the armories. There were severe frosts at that time, very cold, but a miracle happened in that there were no RR-cars, [so] they could not transport us away, and we remained in Czenstokhov. Later on, it was at five o’clock in the evening, the bombardment began. We were bombed. The Russian bombed all of Czenstokhov. And at night they entered Czenstokhov, the Russians. The Germans abandoned the lager. There was great joy for the Jews when the Russians arrived. I, myself, didn’t want to believe. I could see the Jews were taking and putting on rifles, but I didn’t want to believe. I could see the Jews were taking and putting on rifles, but I didn’t want to believe that all that is possible, and that it is true that we have survived this war, this terrible war. But all that was true. In the morning we left the lager. We got out on the street in Czenstokhov. We found many German soldiers, all dead, and we saw freedom. Russians came. We met many Jewish...many Jewish Russians who were in the Russian army. They told us that to us freedom had arrived. We had survived all that, it is true, and we want to journey home and look for our relatives, our family. For me it was very painful. I knew I have no one from the family, but I thought maybe...perhaps...perhaps someone did remain from my family. Three days later I traveled home. I entered our house. There wa-...there was a Polish woman living there. He told me that from my family nobody, not one, had remained. I remained living with this Christian woman. I lived...I lived [there] a few months. And later on I found out that there exist Kibbutzim for Jews.

00:32:39.425 --> 00:32:41.065
David Boder: You didn’t know it before?

00:32:41.065 --> 00:32:57.794
Esther Krueger: I did...I did not know at all that there are Kibbutz.m. I didn’t know what to do, to remain by this Polish woman, or to go. I didn’t know anything, but later on I went to Kibbutz. I met [there] many Jews, many Jewish girls.

00:32:57.794 --> 00:32:59.247
David Boder: Where did you go to Kibbutz?

00:32:59.247 --> 00:33:02.231
Esther Krueger: I went to Sosnowie.

00:33:02.231 --> 00:33:03.544
David Boder: Oh, Sosnowie.

00:33:03.544 --> 00:33:03.856
Esther Krueger: Yes.

00:33:03.856 --> 00:33:04.263
David Boder: Yes?

00:33:04.263 --> 00:33:22.582
Esther Krueger: In Sosnowie I remained in the Kibbutz, well, all the...There were many girls and boys. We started to settle down. The way...the way a Kibbutz had been before today it was much better. There was enough food. Slowly we made for ourselves everything.

00:33:22.582 --> 00:33:23.831
David Boder: Who gave that food?

00:33:23.831 --> 00:33:30.268
Esther Krueger: The food was...there was an official. He brought money, and we did our own cooking and did all our buying.

00:33:30.268 --> 00:33:31.768
David Boder: And from where did he get the money?

00:33:31.768 --> 00:33:34.174
Esther Krueger: That I don’t know.

00:33:34.174 --> 00:33:34.923
David Boder: You don’t know.

00:33:34.923 --> 00:33:36.251
Esther Krueger: He [only] brought the money.

00:33:36.251 --> 00:33:38.594
David Boder: Yes. Nu? And then?

00:33:38.594 --> 00:33:57.547
Esther Krueger: And from America came money from Joint. And we...with that we bought. We lived, received food and clothing. We were in Sosnowie a few months. Then we went. We wanted to go to Italy, but we couldn’t go to Italy.

00:33:57.547 --> 00:33:58.203
David Boder: Yes?

00:33:58.203 --> 00:34:07.140
Esther Krueger: The border was closed. So [we] remained in Austria. In Austria it was very bad. We had no food. We got very little [food].

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:09.639
David Boder: Who held Austria, the English or the Amer-...

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:10.076
Esther Krueger: The English.

00:34:10.076 --> 00:34:10.811
David Boder: Yes.

00:34:10.811 --> 00:34:18.452
Esther Krueger: We had nothing to eat. We went around very hungry. We got as much as in the lager during the times of Hitler.

00:34:18.452 --> 00:34:19.733
David Boder: You mean as little as in the lager.

00:34:19.733 --> 00:34:25.638
Esther Krueger: Very little. Little bread and little soup. Then we went from Austria to Germany.

00:34:25.638 --> 00:34:30.075
David Boder: Did they let you cross the border or did you steal across?

00:34:30.075 --> 00:34:32.716
Esther Krueger: We stole the border. Each border we would...

00:34:32.716 --> 00:34:33.997
David Boder: [Words not clear.] How many people together?

00:34:33.997 --> 00:34:37.263
Esther Krueger: It varied. Sometimes there would go...

00:34:37.263 --> 00:34:38.934
David Boder: You with your group.

00:34:38.934 --> 00:34:42.856
Esther Krueger: There had gone a hundred and twenty. We went across the mountains on foot.

00:34:42.856 --> 00:34:43.981
David Boder: Hm.

00:34:43.981 --> 00:34:50.465
Esther Krueger: Russian soldiers caught us. We went back and then once again across the mountains, and we got through the border.

00:34:50.465 --> 00:34:52.731
David Boder: To where? To Germany?

00:34:52.731 --> 00:34:53.497
Esther Krueger: To Germany.

00:34:53.497 --> 00:34:55.106
David Boder: And where did you go from Germany?

00:34:55.106 --> 00:35:03.168
Esther Krueger: [In] Germany we remained a few weeks, and then we went to Italy. And now we are in Italy.

00:35:03.168 --> 00:35:08.699
David Boder: Hm. And now you are waiting. What is the name of your Kibbutz?

00:35:08.699 --> 00:35:10.668
Esther Krueger: Our Kibbutz is named Nocham.

00:35:10.668 --> 00:35:11.825
David Boder: The Kibbutz-Nocham.

00:35:11.825 --> 00:35:14.012
Esther Krueger: Nocham. Noah-Chalutzim Meichad.

00:35:14.012 --> 00:35:18.949
David Boder: Write it sown. [Pause.] Noah?

00:35:18.949 --> 00:35:21.027
Esther Krueger: Noah Chalutzim Meichad.

00:35:21.027 --> 00:35:24.434
David Boder: Hm. And what does it mean in German, in Yiddish?

00:35:24.434 --> 00:35:28.356
Esther Krueger: It is an...an...assembly of young Chalutzim.

00:35:28.356 --> 00:35:31.638
David Boder: Hm. And now you are waiting to go to...

00:35:31.638 --> 00:35:35.199
Esther Krueger: Now we are here. We don’t know what will happen next.

00:35:35.199 --> 00:35:36.933
David Boder: And what do people do here all day?

00:35:36.933 --> 00:35:47.120
Esther Krueger: The whole day here? It varies. There is also an appell, and we...I also knit. I make socks...

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:47.714
David Boder: Hm.

00:35:47.714 --> 00:35:48.869
Esther Krueger: . . . today [at present], too

00:35:48.869 --> 00:35:49.244
David Boder: Hm.

00:35:49.244 --> 00:35:53.275
Esther Krueger: And various things. What job one has he does. He washes and...

00:35:53.275 --> 00:35:55.509
David Boder: Do you understand Hebrew? Do you understand Hebrew?

00:35:55.509 --> 00:36:03.305
Esther Krueger: I don’t understand Hebrew so well. I studied it after the war, not for long. I do read, but I do not understand too well.

00:36:03.305 --> 00:36:36.931
David Boder: [In English] This concludes Spool one hundred...this concludes...this concludes spool one hundred and nine. Esther Krueger who belongs to a Kibbutz, who went through her...her work in a slave labor situation. She has no tatoo. She was in reasonably clean conditions although she went through typhus, and she is here in Tradate, Italy, expecting by...legally or illegally to reach Palestine.

00:36:36.931 --> 00:36:37.803
David Boder: [In German] Are you married?

00:36:37.803 --> 00:36:38.678
Esther Krueger: No.

00:36:38.678 --> 00:36:39.288
David Boder: No.

00:36:39.288 --> 00:36:42.585
Esther Krueger: All that has been related briefly.

00:36:42.585 --> 00:36:43.288
David Boder: Yes.

00:36:43.288 --> 00:36:44.601
Esther Krueger: About all the experiences.

00:36:44.601 --> 00:36:45.897
David Boder: Yes.

00:36:45.897 --> 00:36:50.085
Esther Krueger: But if one were to write it, one would have to write very much more.

00:36:50.085 --> 00:37:00.053
David Boder: Yes, of course. I would have liked you not to have been so brief, but I will see. Maybe [we] will get together again. [A possible break in the wire.]...to write.

00:37:00.053 --> 00:37:04.535
Esther Krueger: In the future we describe all that, make large books about all the experiences.
