Nelly Bondy: And I had a kind of sauf-conduit for the prefecture....

00:07:31.976 --> 00:07:32.188
David Boder: Yes...

00:07:32.188 --> 00:07:36.947
Nelly Bondy: . . . which didn’t show anything. Just my name and address, and my name is very French.

00:07:36.947 --> 00:07:41.814
David Boder: Ja...but say, what kind of a Force Passive? That was the old Force Passive?

00:07:41.814 --> 00:07:45.018
Nelly Bondy: No. Force Passive [?] means...anti-aircraft, you see.

00:07:45.018 --> 00:07:46.699
David Boder: Oh, the anti-aircraft.

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:55.021
Nelly Bondy: Yes, I was a volunteer there, and I had a safe conduit from the prefecture which...which...I don’t know how to say...

00:07:55.021 --> 00:07:56.886
David Boder: Which gave you safe conduct or something?

00:07:56.886 --> 00:08:02.092
Nelly Bondy: Yes, a safe conduct; and I was authorized to circulate in Paris with all anti-aircraft...

00:08:02.092 --> 00:08:02.423
David Boder: Yes...

00:08:02.423 --> 00:08:03.852
Nelly Bondy: It was to give more special help for circulating.

00:08:03.852 --> 00:08:05.617
David Boder: Now for which prefecture was that?

00:08:05.617 --> 00:08:07.228
Nelly Bondy: The French Prefecture de Police.

00:08:07.228 --> 00:08:07.891
David Boder: Before the Germans?

00:08:07.891 --> 00:08:08.859
Nelly Bondy: Before the Germans came in.

00:08:08.859 --> 00:08:09.534
David Boder: Oh, that’s what I meant.

00:08:09.534 --> 00:08:10.018
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:08:10.018 --> 00:08:11.440
David Boder: Yes...now...

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.291
Nelly Bondy: Alors, I showed them this paper and it worked out all right.

00:08:14.291 --> 00:08:16.729
David Boder: Yes...

00:08:16.729 --> 00:08:30.921
Nelly Bondy: Well, in Nievre we didn’t...we did stay for two or three months and then we left. And we lived in a small place till March...’43. Then I had no more money.

00:08:30.921 --> 00:08:33.446
David Boder: What become of all you property? You say you had a jewelry business?

00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:36.430
Nelly Bondy: It’s all...everything we left. Everything was left in Paris.

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:38.061
David Boder: Everything was left in Paris.

00:08:38.061 --> 00:08:40.999
Nelly Bondy: Well, I just took along the ready money I had.

00:08:40.999 --> 00:08:41.513
David Boder: What?

00:08:41.513 --> 00:08:44.406
Nelly Bondy: I just took along the ready money I had.

00:08:44.406 --> 00:08:45.484
David Boder: Oh, yes. All right.

00:08:45.484 --> 00:08:46.119
Nelly Bondy: Yes...

00:08:46.119 --> 00:08:47.651
David Boder: Go ahead.

00:08:47.651 --> 00:08:52.065
Nelly Bondy: And...well, the money lasted till March ’43. Then I had no more left.

00:08:52.065 --> 00:08:52.710
David Boder: Yes

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:58.293
Nelly Bondy: And in March ’43, the demarcation line was opened to French citizens.

00:08:58.293 --> 00:08:59.160
David Boder: Yes...

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.156
Nelly Bondy: As I had a French identity card...

00:09:01.156 --> 00:09:01.741
David Boder: Yes...

00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:05.360
Nelly Bondy: I went back quite openly with the train from Lyon to Paris.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.751
David Boder: With false paper?

00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:07.361
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:09:07.361 --> 00:09:08.488
David Boder: Yes...

00:09:08.488 --> 00:09:08.821
Nelly Bondy: Well...

00:09:08.821 --> 00:09:10.190
David Boder: Well, your name was still the same, wasn’t it?

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.890
Nelly Bondy: My name, yes. I couldn’t change my name because of the children.

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:13.190
David Boder: Yes.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.592
Nelly Bondy: Because if somebody asked them how...

00:09:14.592 --> 00:09:14.973
David Boder: Yes...

00:09:14.973 --> 00:09:15.810
Nelly Bondy: How’s your name?

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:16.675
David Boder: Yes...

00:09:16.675 --> 00:09:20.312
Nelly Bondy: They...they couldn’t— I couldn’t teach them overnight that they had to change their names.

00:09:20.312 --> 00:09:20.665
David Boder: Yes:

00:09:20.665 --> 00:09:22.447
Nelly Bondy: I couldn’t, so I thought, anyway it’s French.

00:09:22.447 --> 00:09:24.201
David Boder: Yes...

00:09:24.201 --> 00:09:27.931
Nelly Bondy: And...I came back to Paris.

00:09:27.931 --> 00:09:28.074
David Boder: Yes...

00:09:28.074 --> 00:09:31.009
Nelly Bondy: And in Paris I got arrested at the Gare de Lyon...

00:09:31.009 --> 00:09:31.269
David Boder: Why?

00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:35.362
Nelly Bondy: . . . because I had two identity cards. I had my other one, too.

00:09:35.362 --> 00:09:38.989
David Boder: Oh, and from the other it was known that you were Jewish, or what?

00:09:38.989 --> 00:09:42.598
Nelly Bondy: Yes, of course. There was...there was a stamp on it: ‘Jew.”

00:09:42.598 --> 00:09:43.775
David Boder: Who stamped that?

00:09:43.775 --> 00:09:45.227
Nelly Bondy: The prefecture...

00:09:45.227 --> 00:09:45.328
David Boder: Oh!

00:09:45.328 --> 00:09:46.707
Nelly Bondy: . . . after the Germans came back, you see.

00:09:46.707 --> 00:09:47.433
David Boder: After the Germans...

00:09:47.433 --> 00:09:50.516
Nelly Bondy: After the Germans came in there. Before there was nothing on the card.

00:09:50.516 --> 00:09:51.845
David Boder: Nothing. Yes.

00:09:51.845 --> 00:09:55.512
Nelly Bondy: Well, I was arrested and I was sent to Drancy, that famous camp near Paris.

00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:56.752
David Boder: Yes...

00:09:56.752 --> 00:09:58.728
Nelly Bondy: And I stayed there for three months.

00:09:58.728 --> 00:10:00.029
David Boder: And the children?

00:10:00.029 --> 00:10:03.225
Nelly Bondy: The children had remained in the non-occupied zone with their governess.

00:10:03.225 --> 00:10:04.060
David Boder: Yes...

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:10.913
Nelly Bondy: And as soon as she knew that I had been arrested she moved them on to quite another part of France and she left them there.

00:10:10.913 --> 00:10:11.838
David Boder: With whom?

00:10:11.838 --> 00:10:16.042
Nelly Bondy: Well, with a lady—a French lady—who didn’t know that they were Jewish children.

00:10:16.042 --> 00:10:16.546
David Boder: Yes...

00:10:16.546 --> 00:10:20.311
Nelly Bondy: And they have kept them all the time and they are even now...they’re over there.

00:10:20.311 --> 00:10:22.368
David Boder: Ja...they are now over there?

00:10:22.368 --> 00:10:22.537
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:10:22.537 --> 00:10:24.160
David Boder: But you have all three children?

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:24.937
Nelly Bondy: I have all my three children.

00:10:24.937 --> 00:10:26.729
David Boder: I was afraid to ask, you know [laughing].

00:10:26.729 --> 00:10:28.715
Nelly Bondy: Yes. I have them. I found them.

00:10:28.715 --> 00:10:32.002
David Boder: Yes...now...

00:10:32.002 --> 00:10:34.077
Nelly Bondy: Ah...

00:10:34.077 --> 00:10:35.971
David Boder: Ah...so you were arrested...and came to Drancy.

00:10:35.971 --> 00:10:37.423
Nelly Bondy: . . . and I went to Drancy. Yes.

00:10:37.423 --> 00:10:37.723
David Boder: Yes...

00:10:37.723 --> 00:10:40.818
Nelly Bondy: Well, I was sent along on the next...ah...transport.

00:10:40.818 --> 00:10:42.229
David Boder: How long were you in Drancy?

00:10:42.229 --> 00:10:43.459
Nelly Bondy: Three months.

00:10:43.459 --> 00:10:46.627
David Boder: And did anybody try to get you out?

00:10:46.627 --> 00:10:47.210
Nelly Bondy: No.

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:48.266
David Boder: No. You had no friends to...

00:10:48.266 --> 00:10:49.375
Nelly Bondy: I haven’t...got anybody.

00:10:49.375 --> 00:10:51.956
David Boder: The...some people were getting out?

00:10:51.956 --> 00:10:58.129
Nelly Bondy: Yes. I don’t know how they managed it, but I remember on old lady whose son was a South American citizen and...

00:10:58.129 --> 00:10:58.349
David Boder: Did he...

00:10:58.349 --> 00:11:00.827
Nelly Bondy: . . . he, by the consulate...he could get her out.

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:01.319
David Boder: Oh...yes.

00:11:01.319 --> 00:11:08.787
Nelly Bondy: And there was some special categories there, for example, people who were authorized Hungarian...Hungarians...

00:11:08.787 --> 00:11:09.188
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:09.188 --> 00:11:12.323
Nelly Bondy: . . . recognized Hungarians [unintelligible]...

00:11:12.323 --> 00:11:13.160
David Boder: Yes...

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.212
Nelly Bondy: . . . and they...they could get out.

00:11:16.212 --> 00:11:22.974
David Boder: Yes. Now tell me this...three months you were there?

00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:23.567
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:11:23.567 --> 00:11:26.105
David Boder: Did you meet a Mrs. Falk there?

00:11:26.105 --> 00:11:27.234
Nelly Bondy: No, I don’t remember.

00:11:27.234 --> 00:11:27.910
David Boder: You don’t remember.

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:28.190
Nelly Bondy: No.

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:28.987
David Boder: I’m just trying to help people.

00:11:28.987 --> 00:11:30.840
Nelly Bondy: I’m sorry. I don’t remember names.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:31.412
David Boder: Ja...that’s all right.

00:11:31.412 --> 00:11:32.148
Nelly Bondy: You see...

00:11:32.148 --> 00:11:38.833
David Boder: I’m asking because sometimes like before some people tell me, now if you see somebody from there ask something.

00:11:38.833 --> 00:11:39.182
Nelly Bondy: Yes. I understand.

00:11:39.182 --> 00:11:40.155
David Boder: You see, that’s why I’m doing it.

00:11:40.155 --> 00:11:41.010
Nelly Bondy: Yes, I understand, but...

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:43.568
David Boder: All right. Now three months you were in Drancy.

00:11:43.568 --> 00:11:43.740
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:46.107
David Boder: What were you doing in Drancy for three months?

00:11:46.107 --> 00:11:52.940
Nelly Bondy: Nothing. There was nothing to do. I was taking care of the room. I was sweeping the floor and the...

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.216
David Boder: How many people were you in the room?

00:11:55.216 --> 00:12:02.073
Nelly Bondy: There was quite a big dormitory. There were...there must have been...well, eighty or so.

00:12:02.073 --> 00:12:03.656
David Boder: Did you sleep each one in a separate bed ?

00:12:03.656 --> 00:12:04.602
Nelly Bondy: Yes, we did.

00:12:04.602 --> 00:12:05.618
David Boder: You had a separate bed for you?

00:12:05.618 --> 00:12:06.092
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:12:06.092 --> 00:12:07.884
David Boder: Were there women with children?

00:12:07.884 --> 00:12:09.195
Nelly Bondy: Yes, women and children.

00:12:09.195 --> 00:12:10.130
David Boder: There were women and children.

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:10.927
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:12:10.927 --> 00:12:14.201
David Boder: And...did they let you write any letters?

00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:14.806
Nelly Bondy: No.

00:12:14.806 --> 00:12:15.320
David Boder: No...

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:20.776
Nelly Bondy: We had...yes, we had the right to write...one postcard a month, but we could manage to get out letters secretly, you see.

00:12:20.776 --> 00:12:22.052
David Boder: Yes, you could manage to get it out the other way.

00:12:22.052 --> 00:12:23.617
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:12:23.617 --> 00:12:26.165
David Boder: All right. Then what happened?

00:12:26.165 --> 00:12:33.771
Nelly Bondy: Well, in June ’43, I was...loaded into a car. There were forty-nine other people who were taken on the van...

00:12:33.771 --> 00:12:34.941
David Boder: All women?

00:12:34.941 --> 00:12:36.713
Nelly Bondy: No. That was quite mixed up.

00:12:36.713 --> 00:12:37.600
David Boder: Men, women, and children?

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.749
Nelly Bondy: Men, women, and children.

00:12:38.749 --> 00:12:39.546
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:39.546 --> 00:12:44.856
Nelly Bondy: Well, we remained in this car for three nights; two days and three nights.

00:12:44.856 --> 00:12:46.459
David Boder: What kind of car was it?

00:12:46.459 --> 00:12:49.114
Nelly Bondy: Well, a big car. You know, a van you call it in English, I think.

00:12:49.114 --> 00:12:50.604
David Boder: Well, it was a freight car?

00:12:50.604 --> 00:12:51.550
Nelly Bondy: Yes, a freight car.

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:52.052
David Boder: En...did it have...

00:12:52.052 --> 00:12:53.695
Nelly Bondy: Eight horses or forty men.

00:12:53.695 --> 00:12:58.264
David Boder: Yes.... Do they write here to...’Huit et quarante’ and call these eight horses and forty men?

00:12:58.264 --> 00:12:59.484
Nelly Bondy: Yes, I think so.

00:12:59.484 --> 00:13:05.707
David Boder: Because we have in the American Legion...[it] has a special detachment that they call the Eight and Forty.

00:13:05.707 --> 00:13:06.300
Nelly Bondy: I don’t know that.

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:10.723
David Boder: Yes...well, it is a comic kind of detachment of the Legion, you see.

00:13:10.723 --> 00:13:10.975
Nelly Bondy: I see.

00:13:10.975 --> 00:13:14.779
David Boder: And they call themselves the Eight and Forty or the Forty and Eight.

00:13:14.779 --> 00:13:15.536
Nelly Bondy: I see. Yes...

00:13:15.536 --> 00:13:20.473
David Boder: Now tell me. It was a...it was then a...freight car?

00:13:20.473 --> 00:13:21.351
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:13:21.351 --> 00:13:23.345
David Boder: Did it have any benches, anything to...

00:13:23.345 --> 00:13:24.210
Nelly Bondy: Nothing at all.

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:24.531
David Boder: Nothing to sit on.

00:13:24.531 --> 00:13:25.497
Nelly Bondy: Absolutely nothing.

00:13:25.497 --> 00:13:28.136
David Boder: All right. Did it have toilet facilities?

00:13:28.136 --> 00:13:28.862
Nelly Bondy: No.

00:13:28.862 --> 00:13:33.094
David Boder: No...did they open the cars at the stations for you to go out?

00:13:33.094 --> 00:13:42.824
Nelly Bondy: Well,...in France, yes. As soon as we had crossed the border, very...very rarely, you see. I think once or twice.

00:13:42.824 --> 00:13:44.939
David Boder: Did you get water into the car?

00:13:44.939 --> 00:13:47.911
Nelly Bondy: We got...one small bottle of water...

00:13:47.911 --> 00:13:48.119
David Boder: Yes...

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:49.226
Nelly Bondy: . . . for fifty people.

00:13:49.226 --> 00:13:51.603
David Boder: And then how would you drink it?

00:13:51.603 --> 00:13:55.030
Nelly Bondy: Well, we had taken along some bowls and...ah...glasses, you see.

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:56.211
David Boder: Glasses and cups...?

00:13:56.211 --> 00:13:57.509
Nelly Bondy: . . . and cups. From Drancy.

00:13:57.509 --> 00:14:02.278
David Boder: All right. And...there were no toilet facilities in the car?

00:14:02.278 --> 00:14:02.891
Nelly Bondy: No. No.

00:14:02.891 --> 00:14:04.522
David Boder: So what were people doing?

00:14:04.522 --> 00:14:10.046
Nelly Bondy: Well, they had another bucket. That was all. We had...a cover on it...that was...all we could do.

00:14:10.046 --> 00:14:14.570
David Boder: Yes, but where were you...where were you satisfying you need?

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:17.675
Nelly Bondy: Well, I...I told you. There was a second bucket for that.

00:14:17.675 --> 00:14:19.870
David Boder: Yes, but it was open, or was it covered?

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:25.374
Nelly Bondy: Well, it was open; but we had to...we threw it out. There was a quite a small window.

00:14:25.374 --> 00:14:25.648
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:25.648 --> 00:14:28.121
Nelly Bondy: And it was...[we] threw it down, low...

00:14:28.121 --> 00:14:31.264
David Boder: But...I mean, was the bucket in any way...

00:14:31.264 --> 00:14:33.411
Nelly Bondy: No, nothing. No, no. [her voice becomes high in pitch and irritable]

00:14:33.411 --> 00:14:34.813
David Boder: . . . that people had privacy?

00:14:34.813 --> 00:14:38.238
Nelly Bondy: No, nothing. I told you. We just wrapped a cover around us.

00:14:38.238 --> 00:14:38.672
David Boder: Yes...

00:14:38.672 --> 00:14:39.033
Nelly Bondy: That was all.

00:14:39.033 --> 00:14:42.267
David Boder: Oh, you wrapped...you wrapped a cover around you when used it...as you went to use it.

00:14:42.267 --> 00:14:43.192
Nelly Bondy: Yes. Yes, when we used it.

00:14:43.192 --> 00:14:46.711
David Boder: Yes. All right. And then?

00:14:46.711 --> 00:14:53.975
Nelly Bondy: Well, finally we arrived...in some kind of open place. There wasn’t even a station, just a shed.

00:14:53.975 --> 00:14:55.818
David Boder: Yes...

00:14:55.818 --> 00:14:58.135
Nelly Bondy: And we were told to get down...off the car.

00:14:58.135 --> 00:14:58.929
David Boder: Ja...

00:14:58.929 --> 00:15:00.895
Nelly Bondy: And to take along our luggage.

00:15:00.895 --> 00:15:02.135
David Boder: To take along your luggage.

00:15:02.135 --> 00:15:02.589
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:15:02.589 --> 00:15:03.121
David Boder: Yes...

00:15:03.121 --> 00:15:03.847
Nelly Bondy: Well, the next thing...

00:15:03.847 --> 00:15:05.077
David Boder: How much luggage were you having?

00:15:05.077 --> 00:15:07.099
Nelly Bondy: I just had a brief knapsack. That was all.

00:15:07.099 --> 00:15:08.914
David Boder: Yes. All right.

00:15:08.914 --> 00:15:14.063
Nelly Bondy: And...ah...when we had gotten down from the cars we were told to leave the luggage behind...

00:15:14.063 --> 00:15:14.255
David Boder: Yes...

00:15:14.255 --> 00:15:15.301
Nelly Bondy: . . . in the rain.

00:15:15.301 --> 00:15:15.654
David Boder: Yes...

00:15:15.654 --> 00:15:17.963
Nelly Bondy: And then we were chosen out...just...

00:15:17.963 --> 00:15:18.838
David Boder: “Selected” is the word.

00:15:18.838 --> 00:15:19.302
Nelly Bondy: Select, yes.

00:15:19.302 --> 00:15:19.764
David Boder: Yes...

00:15:19.764 --> 00:15:21.062
Nelly Bondy: But we didn’t know then, you see.

00:15:21.062 --> 00:15:22.413
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:22.413 --> 00:15:24.591
Nelly Bondy: They took out old and sick people...

00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:24.801
David Boder: Yes...

00:15:24.801 --> 00:15:26.896
Nelly Bondy: . . . and put them on cars— on...ah...those...

00:15:26.896 --> 00:15:27.630
David Boder: Trucks?

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:28.313
Nelly Bondy: . . . trucks. Yes.

00:15:28.313 --> 00:15:29.019
David Boder: Yes...

00:15:29.019 --> 00:15:34.876
Nelly Bondy: And the others—we were taken into ranges of five each, and we were marched into the camp.

00:15:34.876 --> 00:15:35.761
David Boder: Yes...

00:15:35.761 --> 00:15:39.380
Nelly Bondy: Ah...for the others, we never heard about them again.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:40.963
David Boder: You did not hear about the other people?

00:15:40.963 --> 00:15:41.384
Nelly Bondy: No.

00:15:41.384 --> 00:15:42.695
David Boder: No...

00:15:42.695 --> 00:15:49.114
Nelly Bondy: Well, we got into the camp. It was terrible. The first impression of this camp...it was Birkenau.

00:15:49.114 --> 00:15:51.994
David Boder: Oh, it was Birkenau. Yes...where is Birkenau?

00:15:51.994 --> 00:15:55.248
Nelly Bondy: Birkenau is some...some kilometers from Aus—...from Auschwitz.

00:15:55.248 --> 00:15:56.921
David Boder: And Auschwitz is where?

00:15:56.921 --> 00:15:58.625
Nelly Bondy: In east Upper Silesia.

00:15:58.625 --> 00:15:59.323
David Boder: In east Upper Silesia...

00:15:59.323 --> 00:16:00.192
Nelly Bondy: . . . Upper Silesia...

00:16:00.192 --> 00:16:01.712
David Boder: Who has it now?

00:16:01.712 --> 00:16:02.448
Nelly Bondy: Poland

00:16:02.448 --> 00:16:03.486
David Boder: Poland has it now?

00:16:03.486 --> 00:16:03.950
Nelly Bondy: Yes...Yes

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:08.886
David Boder: So that means from France, from Drancy—how you call it in elegant French—you travelled...

00:16:08.886 --> 00:16:12.170
Nelly Bondy: I couldn’t...I couldn’t tell you the exact distance, but I know it was...

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:16.203
David Boder: Yes, I know. I couldn’t...but you went all through Germany...

00:16:16.203 --> 00:16:17.078
Nelly Bondy: Yes, yes.

00:16:17.078 --> 00:16:18.489
David Boder: . . . into Poland?

00:16:18.489 --> 00:16:19.114
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:16:19.114 --> 00:16:20.374
David Boder: Into occupied Poland...

00:16:20.374 --> 00:16:20.838
Nelly Bondy: That’s right.

00:16:20.838 --> 00:16:23.036
David Boder: And there you were put down in...

00:16:23.036 --> 00:16:23.609
Nelly Bondy: Yes...

00:16:23.609 --> 00:16:24.343
David Boder: Birkenau?

00:16:24.343 --> 00:16:24.774
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:16:24.774 --> 00:16:30.410
David Boder: And they separated some people and so on. Who do you think they separated—the older people?

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:32.343
Nelly Bondy: Well, yes. Older and sick people.

00:16:32.343 --> 00:16:33.573
David Boder: And children?

00:16:33.573 --> 00:16:34.602
Nelly Bondy: Children, too [her voice becomes low].

00:16:34.602 --> 00:16:35.679
David Boder: And they took the children?

00:16:35.679 --> 00:16:36.201
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:16:36.201 --> 00:16:39.356
David Boder: And then you, who did they leave on the other side?

00:16:39.356 --> 00:16:41.967
Nelly Bondy: Well, they left people who were able to work...

00:16:41.967 --> 00:16:42.804
David Boder: Yes...

00:16:42.804 --> 00:16:43.826
Nelly Bondy: . . . who were in good health—who were strong.

00:16:43.826 --> 00:16:49.411
David Boder: Now can you [tell] us [about] the first day you started in Birkenau.

00:16:49.411 --> 00:16:57.182
Nelly Bondy: We arrived in the evening. It was about six o’clock and...[pause]

00:16:57.182 --> 00:16:58.634
David Boder: Yes, yes.

00:16:58.634 --> 00:17:04.227
Nelly Bondy: The first thing to be done was to be tattooed. You see, they preferred...they tattooed the number on our left forearm.

00:17:04.227 --> 00:17:05.727
David Boder: You have a tattoo number?

00:17:05.727 --> 00:17:08.832
Nelly Bondy: No. I got it cut...I got it cut out when I came back. [she shows a rather bad scar]

00:17:08.832 --> 00:17:10.403
David Boder: How did you take it out?

00:17:10.403 --> 00:17:13.798
Nelly Bondy: It was quite an operation. It had to be cut out. It was very deep.

00:17:13.798 --> 00:17:18.082
David Boder: It was...it was cut out and then you had some skin re-grafted?

00:17:18.082 --> 00:17:18.941
Nelly Bondy: Yes, yes. That’s it.

00:17:18.941 --> 00:17:23.405
David Boder: Aha...also you have then on your left arm...

00:17:23.405 --> 00:17:24.018
Nelly Bondy: Yes...

00:17:24.018 --> 00:17:27.081
David Boder: . . . left arm you have a scar.

00:17:27.081 --> 00:17:28.470
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:30.547
David Boder: From the removal of the tattoo.

00:17:30.547 --> 00:17:30.868
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:17:30.868 --> 00:17:32.509
David Boder: Who did that for you?

00:17:32.509 --> 00:17:34.939
Nelly Bondy: In the Hospital San Louis in Paris.

00:17:34.939 --> 00:17:36.570
David Boder: Did they charge you any money for it?

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:37.931
Nelly Bondy: No.

00:17:37.931 --> 00:17:39.915
David Boder: . . . did many people remove their tattoos?

00:17:39.915 --> 00:17:42.524
Nelly Bondy: No, almost none of them.

00:17:42.524 --> 00:17:45.254
David Boder: And where did they graft the skin from? It must have...

00:17:45.254 --> 00:17:47.853
Nelly Bondy: Well, he just...he...no, he cut it out and “grafted” it together.

00:17:47.853 --> 00:17:49.282
David Boder: And sewed it together.

00:17:49.282 --> 00:17:49.635
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:17:49.635 --> 00:17:51.218
David Boder: He cut out and sewed it together.

00:17:51.218 --> 00:17:51.922
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:17:51.922 --> 00:17:58.351
David Boder: All right....and then...eh...you had the tattoo taken...they tattooed you the first day.

00:17:58.351 --> 00:18:00.292
Nelly Bondy: Yes. It was the first thing.

00:18:00.292 --> 00:18:02.006
David Boder: Yes...and?

00:18:02.006 --> 00:18:10.828
Nelly Bondy: And then we went up to [unintelligible]. We did get nothing to eat, just the little bottles of so-called tea. It...I don’t know; it was some concoction from herbs, you see.

00:18:10.828 --> 00:18:11.856
David Boder: Yes.

00:18:11.856 --> 00:18:18.792
Nelly Bondy: And...then we were left alone. There was no commodity, nothing at all. There was the bare floor—that was the sand which was stamped hard.

00:18:18.792 --> 00:18:21.260
David Boder: “Commodity,” you mean no toilet facilities?

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:25.976
Nelly Bondy: No toilet facilities, no...no wrappers, no rags, no...no bed, nothing at all.

00:18:25.976 --> 00:18:26.791
David Boder: Ja.

00:18:26.791 --> 00:18:29.097
Nelly Bondy: Well, we were so tired that we slept all the same.

00:18:29.097 --> 00:18:29.813
David Boder: On the floor.

00:18:29.813 --> 00:18:30.257
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:18:30.257 --> 00:18:32.392
David Boder: Were you separated already—men and women?

00:18:32.392 --> 00:18:34.741
Nelly Bondy: Yes, yes. We were separated immediately upon arriving.

00:18:34.741 --> 00:18:38.509
David Boder: Yes. Now?

00:18:38.509 --> 00:18:46.270
Nelly Bondy: Then...then...we were...we were awakened the next morning. It was quite dark yet.

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:48.075
David Boder: Yes...

00:18:48.075 --> 00:18:48.898
Nelly Bondy: And...

00:18:48.898 --> 00:18:54.460
David Boder: You can help me greatly if you now and then look. If it, the light here, lights up a bit [on the recorder]...

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:55.045
Nelly Bondy: I see.

00:18:55.045 --> 00:18:57.848
David Boder: . . . that means you are speaking loud enough, you see.

00:18:57.848 --> 00:18:58.320
Nelly Bondy: Oh, I see. Yes.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.223
David Boder: Just at times. You get it? All right, go ahead.

00:19:00.223 --> 00:19:01.473
Nelly Bondy: Yes, I understand what you want.

00:19:01.473 --> 00:19:05.889
David Boder: Yes. [coughs] See now, from the cough it went very well [the light]. All right?

00:19:05.889 --> 00:19:06.639
Nelly Bondy: Oh, I see now.

00:19:06.639 --> 00:19:09.893
David Boder: Yes. Yes, you were...eh...

00:19:09.893 --> 00:19:28.915
Nelly Bondy: Yes, I just reflected. Ah...I was...I was think[ing] over what we did there and, yes, the first thing we were searched and we were taken...They took away what we still had left from...from handkerchiefs or some small things, and then we were all taken away all our things. All our clothing was taken away.

00:19:28.915 --> 00:19:29.306
David Boder: Yes...

00:19:29.306 --> 00:19:30.496
Nelly Bondy: Absolutely everything.

00:19:30.496 --> 00:19:31.169
David Boder: Yes...

00:19:31.169 --> 00:19:33.306
Nelly Bondy: And then they cut our hair.

00:19:33.306 --> 00:19:33.710
David Boder: Ja...

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:36.137
Nelly Bondy: They...ah...with razor.

00:19:36.137 --> 00:19:37.236
David Boder: With an electric razor?

00:19:37.236 --> 00:19:37.650
Nelly Bondy: Yes, we...

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:38.596
David Boder: They sheared you completely?

00:19:38.596 --> 00:19:40.449
Nelly Bondy: Yes, we were quite shaved.

00:19:40.449 --> 00:19:43.572
David Boder: Yes...eh...your hair from the and...

00:19:43.572 --> 00:19:44.558
Nelly Bondy: Every...everything.

00:19:44.558 --> 00:19:45.393
David Boder: The whole body?

00:19:45.393 --> 00:19:46.248
Nelly Bondy: Yes, the whole body.

00:19:46.248 --> 00:19:47.244
David Boder: Yes...abdominal hair?

00:19:47.244 --> 00:19:47.806
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:19:47.806 --> 00:19:49.601
David Boder: Why did they do that?

00:19:49.601 --> 00:19:53.752
Nelly Bondy: I can’t tell you. I thought first it was because of...

00:19:53.752 --> 00:19:54.004
David Boder: Lice?

00:19:54.004 --> 00:19:54.892
Nelly Bondy: . . . vermin or so.

00:19:54.892 --> 00:19:55.441
David Boder: Yes...

00:19:55.441 --> 00:19:59.964
Nelly Bondy: But...later on I changed my mind. I think it was the sheer malice or so.

00:19:59.964 --> 00:20:00.893
David Boder: Chicanery?

00:20:00.893 --> 00:20:01.609
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:20:01.609 --> 00:20:03.645
David Boder: Tell me, who did the shearing?

00:20:03.645 --> 00:20:05.082
Nelly Bondy: They were deportees. They were...

00:20:05.082 --> 00:20:05.920
David Boder: Men or women?

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:06.646
Nelly Bondy: Women.

00:20:06.646 --> 00:20:07.047
David Boder: Women did the shaving?

00:20:07.047 --> 00:20:07.676
Nelly Bondy: Yes

00:20:07.676 --> 00:20:08.001
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:08.001 --> 00:20:13.494
Nelly Bondy: Women did it but men passed...through the room all the time. You see, that was the most horrible experience.

00:20:13.494 --> 00:20:16.271
David Boder: Who were these deputies? Were they themselves...eh...

00:20:16.271 --> 00:20:16.987
Nelly Bondy: Deportees.

00:20:16.987 --> 00:20:17.165
David Boder: Deportees.

00:20:17.165 --> 00:20:18.561
Nelly Bondy: No, they were deported people, yes.

00:20:18.561 --> 00:20:20.211
David Boder: Were they Jewish deportees?

00:20:20.211 --> 00:20:23.160
Nelly Bondy: For the most...yes. Most of them were Slovakian or Polian...or Polish.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.155
David Boder: Slovakian or Polish?

00:20:24.155 --> 00:20:24.379
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:20:24.379 --> 00:20:26.922
David Boder: All right.

00:20:26.922 --> 00:20:27.481
Nelly Bondy: Then we had to...

00:20:27.481 --> 00:20:29.344
David Boder: Did they take...took off all your hair?

00:20:29.344 --> 00:20:35.593
Nelly Bondy: All your hair. Absolutely everything. It took me three days to recognize my fellow...the fellow...[prisoner] with whom I had arrived.

00:20:35.593 --> 00:20:36.502
David Boder: Oh, you couldn’t recognize the face?

00:20:36.502 --> 00:20:46.863
Nelly Bondy: I couldn’t recognize them. First of all, [for] three days at least. People from...with whom I had been together in Drancy for months, for three months. I couldn’t recognize for seven days.

00:20:46.863 --> 00:20:49.716
David Boder: Yes. All right.

00:20:49.716 --> 00:20:53.965
Nelly Bondy: Well, [pauses] do you want...

00:20:53.965 --> 00:20:56.853
David Boder: Yes...go ahead. What happened then?

00:20:56.853 --> 00:21:01.199
Nelly Bondy: Well, next we were waiting for so-called douche, a shower bath.

00:21:01.199 --> 00:21:02.158
David Boder: Yes...

00:21:02.158 --> 00:21:06.392
Nelly Bondy: We had to wait...in a very huge room. The room was overheated.

00:21:06.392 --> 00:21:08.509
David Boder: What do you mean? They took you to another room?

00:21:08.509 --> 00:21:15.083
Nelly Bondy: Yes. We were taken to another room then, and there we were [unintelligible]; the others [?] sat down and we were waiting.

00:21:15.083 --> 00:21:16.834
David Boder: Yes...

00:21:16.834 --> 00:21:20.723
Nelly Bondy: Finally we got into the shower bath. It was cold.

00:21:20.723 --> 00:21:20.891
David Boder: Yes...

00:21:20.891 --> 00:21:23.586
Nelly Bondy: No soap and no towels. Nothing at all.

00:21:23.586 --> 00:21:24.825
David Boder: Yes...

00:21:24.825 --> 00:21:41.401
Nelly Bondy: Well, you see, after three days and three nights on the train or so, we were dirty and we felt very uncomfortable. Nothing to be done. And there we had the first experience of how things were going on there. There was one woman who wanted a towel and she was beaten terribly because she had asked for it.

00:21:41.401 --> 00:21:42.386
David Boder: Who beat her?

00:21:42.386 --> 00:21:46.071
Nelly Bondy: That was a German deportee that knew Jewish.

00:21:46.071 --> 00:21:46.816
David Boder: A man or a woman?

00:21:46.816 --> 00:21:47.781
Nelly Bondy: No, a woman.

00:21:47.781 --> 00:21:49.847
David Boder: Yes...

00:21:49.847 --> 00:21:50.441
Nelly Bondy: Well, afterwards...

00:21:50.441 --> 00:21:52.304
David Boder: The “deputy” beat her?

00:21:52.304 --> 00:21:53.629
Nelly Bondy: A deportee. Well, a deported woman.

00:21:53.629 --> 00:21:54.607
David Boder: Yes, a deportee. Yes...

00:21:54.607 --> 00:21:55.208
Nelly Bondy: Ja...yes...

00:21:55.208 --> 00:21:57.071
David Boder: How did she beat her? What did she beat her with?

00:21:57.071 --> 00:21:58.985
Nelly Bondy: With a stick. With a big stick.

00:21:58.985 --> 00:22:00.716
David Boder: All right.

00:22:00.716 --> 00:22:09.132
Nelly Bondy: Then we were taken to another room, and we got clothing. That’s to say we got men’s underwear, a shirt and a trou—...a pair of trousers.

00:22:09.132 --> 00:22:09.604
David Boder: Hum...

00:22:09.604 --> 00:22:12.609
Nelly Bondy: And then we got old Russian uniforms.

00:22:12.609 --> 00:22:13.157
David Boder: Yes...

00:22:13.157 --> 00:22:14.061
Nelly Bondy: A pair pants...uniforms.

00:22:14.061 --> 00:22:15.112
David Boder: Old Russian uniforms?

00:22:15.112 --> 00:22:18.437
Nelly Bondy: Yes. Old Russian uniforms, pants and a jacket.

00:22:18.437 --> 00:22:18.579
David Boder: Yes...

00:22:18.579 --> 00:22:21.960
Nelly Bondy: And we got a kind of a foulard to put on our heads.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.864
David Boder: Oh, you got a kind of headgear?

00:22:23.864 --> 00:22:24.397
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:22:24.397 --> 00:22:25.600
David Boder: Yes...a...yes?

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:26.666
Nelly Bondy: Just a...

00:22:26.666 --> 00:22:28.565
David Boder: A little...scarf?

00:22:28.565 --> 00:22:29.565
Nelly Bondy: A little scarf. Yes.

00:22:29.565 --> 00:22:30.844
David Boder: Yes...

00:22:30.844 --> 00:22:38.031
Nelly Bondy: Well, as for shoes, personally, they left my own shoes because I had arrived with...ah...my skiing shoes, you see.

00:22:38.031 --> 00:22:38.960
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:44.965
Nelly Bondy: But the others had to take off their shoes, and they got...they got old shoes with...ah...wooden soles.

00:22:44.965 --> 00:22:45.107
David Boder: Ja...

00:22:45.107 --> 00:22:47.769
Nelly Bondy: But much too big, so most of them lost them.

00:22:47.769 --> 00:22:48.693
David Boder: Yes...

00:22:48.693 --> 00:22:54.013
Nelly Bondy: The soil was sticky and...ah...they clung to the soil and they lost most of them there, and went barefooted along.

00:22:54.013 --> 00:22:57.967
David Boder: Ja...That was in what month again?

00:22:57.967 --> 00:22:58.455
Nelly Bondy: Pardon?

00:22:58.455 --> 00:22:59.831
David Boder: What month was it?

00:22:59.831 --> 00:23:00.729
Nelly Bondy: It was June.

00:23:00.729 --> 00:23:01.237
David Boder: June. Ja...

00:23:01.237 --> 00:23:13.777
Nelly Bondy: Yes, it was June. Then we came...to another block and there we were arranged into kind of a...well, quarters—sleeping quarters.

00:23:13.777 --> 00:23:15.305
David Boder: Yes...

00:23:15.305 --> 00:23:20.183
Nelly Bondy: They were...they were three...three—I don’t know. My English is not good enough for that.

00:23:20.183 --> 00:23:21.310
David Boder: Three shifts?

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:21.696
Nelly Bondy: Yes. Three...

00:23:21.696 --> 00:23:22.858
David Boder: Three tiers. Yes?

00:23:22.858 --> 00:23:23.244
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:23:23.244 --> 00:23:24.412
David Boder: One over the other in three shifts?

00:23:24.412 --> 00:23:25.128
Nelly Bondy: That’s it. Yes.

00:23:25.128 --> 00:23:26.483
David Boder: Yes...

00:23:26.483 --> 00:23:26.859
Nelly Bondy: Well, anyone...

00:23:26.859 --> 00:23:28.752
David Boder: But they were separate beds.

00:23:28.752 --> 00:23:36.294
Nelly Bondy: No, of course not. In each of them could...two people could have slept comfortably, but we were eight for each.

00:23:36.294 --> 00:23:39.781
David Boder: Ja...Wait a moment. What were they, board...boards?

00:23:39.781 --> 00:23:42.502
Nelly Bondy: They were woo—...yes, wood, shelves...wooden shelves.

00:23:42.502 --> 00:23:43.791
David Boder: Wood...platforms...like little platforms?

00:23:43.791 --> 00:23:46.791
Nelly Bondy: Yes, wood platforms with very little straw on it.

00:23:46.791 --> 00:23:47.278
David Boder: Yes...

00:23:47.278 --> 00:23:49.522
Nelly Bondy: And that’s all, and we were eight people in bed.

00:23:49.522 --> 00:23:52.776
David Boder: How was it, about the width of a double bed here in France?

00:23:52.776 --> 00:23:53.715
Nelly Bondy: Yes, about that.

00:23:53.715 --> 00:23:56.040
David Boder: Ja...and they put eight people in one...

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:56.918
Nelly Bondy: Eight people to a bed...

00:23:56.918 --> 00:23:57.730
David Boder: . . . on one board?

00:23:57.730 --> 00:23:58.603
Nelly Bondy: Yes, with a...

00:23:58.603 --> 00:23:59.669
David Boder: . . . On the same level?

00:23:59.669 --> 00:24:01.710
Nelly Bondy: On the same level with three covers [?].

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:03.375
David Boder: That means on the upper level were two [?]...

00:24:03.375 --> 00:24:04.601
Nelly Bondy: [speaking at the same time]...on the upper level...ah...

00:24:04.601 --> 00:24:06.154
David Boder: . . . and on the top level?

00:24:06.154 --> 00:24:06.276
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:24:06.276 --> 00:24:06.855
David Boder: And the middle level.

00:24:06.855 --> 00:24:08.667
Nelly Bondy: And the middle and then the...yes, that’s it.

00:24:08.667 --> 00:24:10.231
David Boder: What level did you get?

00:24:10.231 --> 00:24:11.292
Nelly Bondy: The upper, the most upper.

00:24:11.292 --> 00:24:15.064
David Boder: You got the upper...the most upper one. Yes?

00:24:15.064 --> 00:24:32.898
Nelly Bondy: Well, then we remained there for a day. It was Saturday and we didn’t do anything. We just lulled and they fed a kind of soup which was...which was concocted from herbs. How do you say in English, “ortice,” Brenn-nesseln [burning, stinging nettles].

00:24:32.898 --> 00:24:40.208
David Boder: Eh...ja...ah...oh...ah...from...”Bren-nessel.” Well, I will have to translate that word. It is a...

00:24:40.208 --> 00:24:41.310
Nelly Bondy: I don’t know the word in English.

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:41.498
David Boder: Yes...

00:24:41.498 --> 00:24:42.437
Nelly Bondy: You see, my English is rather...

00:24:42.437 --> 00:24:45.787
David Boder: Yes. All right. And?

00:24:45.787 --> 00:24:54.217
Nelly Bondy: Well, we remained there the whole time. Next day it was Sunday and we got a...vaccination against typhoid fever.

00:24:54.217 --> 00:24:55.110
David Boder: Yes...

00:24:55.110 --> 00:25:00.202
Nelly Bondy: I wasn’t quite sure if it was really a vaccination but it...it seems...it appears to have really been one.

00:25:00.202 --> 00:25:00.837
David Boder: Injection?

00:25:00.837 --> 00:25:02.081
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:25:02.081 --> 00:25:04.198
David Boder: Yes...

00:25:04.198 --> 00:25:09.614
Nelly Bondy: Well then, next day we started to work. It was “out of work,” “Aussenarbeit” they called it...

00:25:09.614 --> 00:25:10.619
David Boder: Yes. Outdoor work [off-camp work].

00:25:10.619 --> 00:25:19.387
Nelly Bondy: Outdoor work, yes. We had to walk about...ah...an hour and a half to get to the working place, and we had to demolish a house.

00:25:19.387 --> 00:25:19.586
David Boder: Oh, demolish...

00:25:19.586 --> 00:25:21.641
Nelly Bondy: To take off bricks and...and rubbish...

00:25:21.641 --> 00:25:21.748
David Boder: Ja...

00:25:21.748 --> 00:25:23.672
Nelly Bondy: . . . and so on, with our hands, of course.

00:25:23.672 --> 00:25:25.180
David Boder: In the city?

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:30.160
Nelly Bondy: No, it was not in the city. It was some...some deserted spot out in the woods or...so I couldn’t tell you exactly where it was.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.008
David Boder: What do you mean, with your hands? They gave you some hammers? They gave you some...

00:25:33.008 --> 00:25:36.769
Nelly Bondy: Well, not very much. We had some shovel and some spikes. That was all.

00:25:36.769 --> 00:25:39.236
David Boder: And the house had to be taken apart, demolished?

00:25:39.236 --> 00:25:39.714
Nelly Bondy: Pardon?

00:25:39.714 --> 00:25:40.998
David Boder: They had...you had to demolish that?

00:25:40.998 --> 00:25:42.399
Nelly Bondy: Yes, we had to demolish a house.

00:25:42.399 --> 00:25:43.841
David Boder: To wreck it—what we call it.

00:25:43.841 --> 00:25:45.958
Nelly Bondy: Yes. Yes, that’s it, wreck it.

00:25:45.958 --> 00:25:46.735
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:46.735 --> 00:25:53.177
Nelly Bondy: I remember, we had to sink in a well which was quite ready to function. Well, we had to destroy it. They took a big...

00:25:53.177 --> 00:25:54.045
David Boder: A well?

00:25:54.045 --> 00:25:55.111
Nelly Bondy: A well, yes.

00:25:55.111 --> 00:25:55.832
David Boder: Ja...

00:25:55.832 --> 00:25:58.284
Nelly Bondy: They took a big trunk of a tree.

00:25:58.284 --> 00:25:58.431
David Boder: Yes...

00:25:58.431 --> 00:26:00.979
Nelly Bondy: We had to...we, about twenty people, to lift it...

00:26:00.979 --> 00:26:01.284
David Boder: Ja...

00:26:01.284 --> 00:26:04.289
Nelly Bondy: . . . and to...well, to...

00:26:04.289 --> 00:26:05.182
David Boder: To break the wall?

00:26:05.182 --> 00:26:06.027
Nelly Bondy: To break the wall of this...

00:26:06.027 --> 00:26:07.976
David Boder: Well, like the old Romans used to take...

00:26:07.976 --> 00:26:09.672
Nelly Bondy: Yes, something [in] this kind of way [chuckle].

00:26:09.672 --> 00:26:11.068
David Boder: Ja...used to take cities...

00:26:11.068 --> 00:26:11.205
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:26:11.205 --> 00:26:12.312
David Boder: . . . with a battering ram.

00:26:12.312 --> 00:26:14.002
Nelly Bondy: [laughs] That’s it exactly. Yes.

00:26:14.002 --> 00:26:16.875
David Boder: Ja...Yes, all right.

00:26:16.875 --> 00:26:34.268
Nelly Bondy: Well, we did that for a week or so; but personally I didn’t remain there. Jus—...when we had arrived, even before we were tattooed, there was a young Nazi. He was quite a boy. He came to ask for somebody who knew English.

00:26:34.268 --> 00:26:34.908
David Boder: Ja...

00:26:34.908 --> 00:26:44.543
Nelly Bondy: We were three, and he took down our names; and he chose me afterwards. And so I was removed from there, and I came to Auschwitz to the Staatsgebaude.

00:26:44.543 --> 00:26:45.132
David Boder: Yes...

00:26:45.132 --> 00:26:47.503
Nelly Bondy: . . . to be...to be working in the office.

00:26:47.503 --> 00:26:49.335
David Boder: Yes. Why did they need English there?

00:26:49.335 --> 00:26:52.462
Nelly Bondy: Well, he had [apparently someone?] who wanted to take English lessons.

00:26:52.462 --> 00:26:53.569
David Boder: Oh!

00:26:53.569 --> 00:26:54.244
Nelly Bondy: He learned...

00:26:54.244 --> 00:26:56.173
David Boder: He didn’t...they didn’t need you as a interpreter there?

00:26:56.173 --> 00:26:59.280
Nelly Bondy: No, but anyway I was...safe, so...

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:02.514
David Boder: Ja...They wanted somebody...take English lessons. All right.

00:27:02.514 --> 00:27:05.209
Nelly Bondy: Yes. One of the Nazis wanted to take English lessons.

00:27:05.209 --> 00:27:05.352
David Boder: Yes...

00:27:05.352 --> 00:27:08.616
Nelly Bondy: He never did afterwards, but anyway I was working in the office.

00:27:08.616 --> 00:27:10.895
David Boder: Yes...

00:27:10.895 --> 00:27:17.057
Nelly Bondy: And so...so I came to the office, and I have been working in the administration of the camp.

00:27:17.057 --> 00:27:18.717
David Boder: Did they give you other clothes?

00:27:18.717 --> 00:27:21.676
Nelly Bondy: Yes, I got better clothing. I got these striped clothes, you see.

00:27:21.676 --> 00:27:23.098
David Boder: Ja...

00:27:23.098 --> 00:27:29.062
Nelly Bondy: And then I was allowed to grow my hair a bit, not very...very much, but until the...

00:27:29.062 --> 00:27:31.472
David Boder: . . . the bare skull disappeared?

00:27:31.472 --> 00:27:32.477
Nelly Bondy: Yes. Yes.

00:27:32.477 --> 00:27:33.960
David Boder: All right.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:40.452
Nelly Bondy: And while I’ve been working there ever since the evacuation of Auschwitz.

00:27:40.452 --> 00:27:41.457
David Boder: Until the...

00:27:41.457 --> 00:27:45.806
Nelly Bondy: Until Auschwitz was evacuated on January the 18th in ’45.

00:27:45.806 --> 00:27:46.014
David Boder: And did the...

00:27:46.014 --> 00:27:47.253
Nelly Bondy: When the Russians appeared...

00:27:47.253 --> 00:27:50.405
David Boder: And [to] where was Auschwitz...evacuated?

00:27:50.405 --> 00:27:55.025
Nelly Bondy: Well...we went...I was personally sent to Ravensbrück.

00:27:55.025 --> 00:27:55.213
David Boder: Yes...

00:27:55.213 --> 00:27:59.949
Nelly Bondy: Others were sent to other camps. The men were sent to Gross-Rosen, to Dachau...

00:27:59.949 --> 00:28:00.436
David Boder: Yes...

00:28:00.436 --> 00:28:01.716
Nelly Bondy: . . . to Mauthausen.

00:28:01.716 --> 00:28:03.153
David Boder: Yes...

00:28:03.153 --> 00:28:05.463
Nelly Bondy: Well, all kinds of camps.

00:28:05.463 --> 00:28:08.148
David Boder: Um...hum...

00:28:08.148 --> 00:28:12.570
Nelly Bondy: We were speeded [rushed] from here [?] from that time onwards. You see, because presently [?]...

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:13.393
David Boder: You went from the...

00:28:13.393 --> 00:28:15.205
Nelly Bondy: . . . from...after we had left Auschwitz.

00:28:15.205 --> 00:28:15.682
David Boder: Yes.

00:28:15.682 --> 00:28:21.665
Nelly Bondy: Because personally I had had a relatively good time in Auschwitz, you see working in the office.

00:28:21.665 --> 00:28:23.401
David Boder: I mean, relatively good conditions.

00:28:23.401 --> 00:28:33.453
Nelly Bondy: Conditions, yes. I had a...when I was in...eh...the office, I had a bed for myself. We had a...a shower room. We had showers twice week.

00:28:33.453 --> 00:28:34.433
David Boder: Yes...

00:28:34.433 --> 00:28:35.017
Nelly Bondy: They were...

00:28:35.017 --> 00:28:36.474
David Boder: Warm showers?

00:28:36.474 --> 00:28:37.504
Nelly Bondy: Warm shower, yes.

00:28:37.504 --> 00:28:38.773
David Boder: Yes...

00:28:38.773 --> 00:28:41.515
Nelly Bondy: There was...ah...hot water to wash oneself with.

00:28:41.515 --> 00:28:41.896
David Boder: Ja...

00:28:41.896 --> 00:28:52.988
Nelly Bondy: Whereas in Birkenau there was no water at all. When we came home from the...”outdoor” [off-camp] work, we were...we were dirty and thirsty and everything; and there was no water, neither to drink nor to...to wash ourselves in.

00:28:52.988 --> 00:29:01.205
David Boder: Yes...[loud noise] Yes, and...?

00:29:01.205 --> 00:29:04.383
Nelly Bondy: Well, ah...[loud noise].

00:29:04.383 --> 00:29:04.611
David Boder: And?

00:29:04.611 --> 00:29:11.089
Nelly Bondy: When we had left the camp, first we had to go on foot for four days.

00:29:11.089 --> 00:29:11.551
David Boder: Yes...

00:29:11.551 --> 00:29:18.328
Nelly Bondy: We hadn’t got any...anything to eat with us, except one loaf of bread each, and not even everyone had got it.

00:29:18.328 --> 00:29:19.186
David Boder: Yes...

00:29:19.186 --> 00:29:21.831
David Boder: Were you walking men and women?

00:29:21.831 --> 00:29:22.892
Nelly Bondy: No, only women.

00:29:22.892 --> 00:29:23.770
David Boder: Only women.

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:25.364
Nelly Bondy: Yes. And...

00:29:25.364 --> 00:29:26.603
David Boder: Eh...did anybody get sick?

00:29:26.603 --> 00:29:32.111
Nelly Bondy: Yes. I’m sorry to say that a few who couldn’t follow the...the others were shot.

00:29:32.111 --> 00:29:32.827
David Boder: Were shot?

00:29:32.827 --> 00:29:33.076
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:29:33.076 --> 00:29:34.462
David Boder: Have you seen that yourself?

00:29:34.462 --> 00:29:35.807
Nelly Bondy: I have seen one.

00:29:35.807 --> 00:29:36.609
David Boder: You have seen one.

00:29:36.609 --> 00:29:36.599
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:29:36.599 --> 00:29:38.264
David Boder: Eh...who shot her?

00:29:38.264 --> 00:29:42.111
Nelly Bondy: The Nazis. The guards who accompanied us.

00:29:42.111 --> 00:29:47.350
David Boder: . . . What were they...shooting them like sentenced people—putting them to the wall?

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:51.304
Nelly Bondy: Oh, no, no! She fell down somewhere and he just shot at her. That was all.

00:29:51.304 --> 00:29:52.746
David Boder: Aha...yes...

00:29:52.746 --> 00:30:00.886
Nelly Bondy: They were on all sides. The...all the route was bordered with...corpses, you see.

00:30:00.886 --> 00:30:02.460
David Boder: And whose corpses were that?

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:05.531
Nelly Bondy: Well, they were men who had to be “leaded” before...

00:30:05.531 --> 00:30:05.836
David Boder: Yes...

00:30:05.836 --> 00:30:07.709
Nelly Bondy: . . . and who had been shot like that.

00:30:07.709 --> 00:30:09.780
David Boder: Ja...

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:17.498
Nelly Bondy: And in one of these villages I saw a sleigh quite covered with corpses; but they were...they had been...they had been...ah...

00:30:17.498 --> 00:30:18.539
David Boder: Frozen?

00:30:18.539 --> 00:30:26.317
Nelly Bondy: Not quite. No. Partly frozen, but just...not just propret [neatly], just...any way...not...

00:30:26.317 --> 00:30:26.794
David Boder: Ja...ja...

00:30:26.794 --> 00:30:28.007
Nelly Bondy: . . . not laid or...

00:30:28.007 --> 00:30:29.911
David Boder: Ja...Just thrown on there—loaded.

00:30:29.911 --> 00:30:38.551
Nelly Bondy: Just thrown on it. Yes. And over [?] there was an arm peeping out on one side and a head from the other side. [pause]

00:30:38.551 --> 00:30:41.282
David Boder: And whose corpses, you think, were they?

00:30:41.282 --> 00:30:46.054
Nelly Bondy: They were...they were interned people who had been evacuated before.

00:30:46.054 --> 00:30:46.293
David Boder: Yes.

00:30:46.293 --> 00:30:52.034
Nelly Bondy: People who either couldn’t follow the...the others or who had tried to escape and who went one pace...

00:30:52.034 --> 00:30:52.318
David Boder: Ja...

00:30:52.318 --> 00:30:54.588
Nelly Bondy: . . . too much...ah...to the side, you see, and they were shot.

00:30:54.588 --> 00:30:58.447
David Boder: . . . and were shot. And so from Birkenau where did you get?

00:30:58.447 --> 00:31:01.335
Nelly Bondy: Well, from Birkenau...no, I have been removed to Auschwitz.

00:31:01.335 --> 00:31:02.706
David Boder: Yes, and from Auschwitz?

00:31:02.706 --> 00:31:10.752
Nelly Bondy: And from Auschwitz, well, we went to a little...ah...radio station which was called Losmar [?] somewhere in Silesia.

00:31:10.752 --> 00:31:11.488
David Boder: Yes...

00:31:11.488 --> 00:31:16.473
Nelly Bondy: And from there we were loaded on these kind of freight cars again.

00:31:16.473 --> 00:31:17.138
David Boder: Yes...

00:31:17.138 --> 00:31:19.123
Nelly Bondy: And we were sent to Ravensbrück.

00:31:19.123 --> 00:31:19.392
David Boder: Ja...

00:31:19.392 --> 00:31:24.204
Nelly Bondy: Only our conditions were very bad. The...the car would small...

00:31:24.204 --> 00:31:25.554
David Boder: Yes...

00:31:25.554 --> 00:31:29.264
Nelly Bondy: And we had...not all of us had a cover with her.

00:31:29.264 --> 00:31:29.589
David Boder: Hm...

00:31:29.589 --> 00:31:32.432
Nelly Bondy: And I frostbit my feet on this occasion.

00:31:32.432 --> 00:31:33.787
David Boder: Yes...

00:31:33.787 --> 00:31:45.363
Nelly Bondy: Well, we arrived in Ravensbrück and they lodged us in...in one big room where there would have been room for perhaps five hundred people, but we were twelve hundred.

00:31:45.363 --> 00:31:45.683
David Boder: Yes...

00:31:45.683 --> 00:31:53.292
Nelly Bondy: There wasn’t even room to stretch out your feet. We couldn’t sleep. We just sat crouched together on the floor and just try to...to try...

00:31:53.292 --> 00:31:53.499
David Boder: Ja...

00:31:53.499 --> 00:31:54.778
Nelly Bondy: . . . to make the best of it.

00:31:54.778 --> 00:31:56.525
David Boder: What, were you sitting back to back?

00:31:56.525 --> 00:31:59.119
Nelly Bondy: Back to back or...it was terrible.

00:31:59.119 --> 00:31:59.307
David Boder: Yes...

00:31:59.307 --> 00:32:06.226
Nelly Bondy: And...you needn’t get up, you see, and get out, because as soon as you left your place it was...the room was taken up immediately, and...

00:32:06.226 --> 00:32:06.343
David Boder: Yes...

00:32:06.343 --> 00:32:10.074
Nelly Bondy: There was no means to get back. It was very, very hard.

00:32:10.074 --> 00:32:11.094
David Boder: . . . was it clean?

00:32:11.094 --> 00:32:12.648
Nelly Bondy: No, of course not. Nothing was...

00:32:12.648 --> 00:32:14.947
David Boder: Did they watch that you had no lice, or so?

00:32:14.947 --> 00:32:18.988
Nelly Bondy: No, no. We hadn’t even water to wash ourselves with. Nothing.

00:32:18.988 --> 00:32:20.394
David Boder: So these people had lice?

00:32:20.394 --> 00:32:22.486
Nelly Bondy: Yes, of course. They were quite covered with lice.

00:32:22.486 --> 00:32:22.989
David Boder: What?

00:32:22.989 --> 00:32:24.791
Nelly Bondy: We were covered with them. All of us.

00:32:24.791 --> 00:32:26.558
David Boder: Yes...

00:32:26.558 --> 00:32:32.431
Nelly Bondy: We remained there for twelve days; and then we were marched into the very camp of Ravensbrück

00:32:32.431 --> 00:32:32.786
David Boder: Yes...

00:32:32.786 --> 00:32:56.650
Nelly Bondy: And there into a block where it was a bit better. Well, there was no washing conditions but we could get...get into other blocks. I got to the blocks where the French lived and there I could have a wash if I arranged...if I tried to arrange that. We were three in a bed, and the food was...ah...eatable.

00:32:56.650 --> 00:32:57.320
David Boder: Was eatable?

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:57.848
Nelly Bondy: It was eatable.

00:32:57.848 --> 00:32:58.356
David Boder: Yes?

00:32:58.356 --> 00:33:05.874
Nelly Bondy: But we didn’t remain very long. We remained for—I couldn’t tell—three or four weeks, and then were sent to another camp.

00:33:05.874 --> 00:33:08.031
David Boder: Why? Did the Russians again come near or what?

00:33:08.031 --> 00:33:10.123
Nelly Bondy: No. I think they had too many people there.

00:33:10.123 --> 00:33:11.610
David Boder: Yes...

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:22.208
Nelly Bondy: So they sent us to a camp. It was called Malchow which was dependent on the camp of Ravensbrück. It’s to...it’s there in Metel—...in...it’s in the Mark in Germany, you see.

00:33:22.208 --> 00:33:25.411
David Boder: Ja...yes. It was a sh—...a...a branch of it.

00:33:25.411 --> 00:33:26.974
Nelly Bondy: Yes, a branch of it [chuckle] .

00:33:26.974 --> 00:33:29.584
David Boder: Ja...well?

00:33:29.584 --> 00:33:49.432
Nelly Bondy: Well,...ah...there we were starving, absolutely starving. We got bread—three slices of...of dry bread a day and once a day a kind of a so-called soup. It was water where they had just thrown some vegetables which were not even clean—which were not washed. And the soup...

00:33:49.432 --> 00:33:49.676
David Boder: Ja...

00:33:49.676 --> 00:33:52.905
Nelly Bondy: It was never warm. It was never cooked.

00:33:52.905 --> 00:33:53.590
David Boder: Um...

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:58.565
Nelly Bondy: The water was tepid and there was a...a sort of...of gade [fish?] you see. You couldn’t eat it.

00:33:58.565 --> 00:34:00.885
David Boder: Ja...yes...the sediments of the...

00:34:00.885 --> 00:34:03.520
Nelly Bondy: The sediments of the earth and I don’t know what.

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:03.921
David Boder: Ja...

00:34:03.921 --> 00:34:07.911
Nelly Bondy: Anyway, we couldn’t eat it. We were really starving there.

00:34:07.911 --> 00:34:09.013
David Boder: Um...

00:34:09.013 --> 00:34:14.368
Nelly Bondy: We had mattresses on the floor, no beds; and we were five on one mattress.

00:34:14.368 --> 00:34:14.917
David Boder: Five? On one?

00:34:14.917 --> 00:34:17.572
Nelly Bondy: Five people on one...on two, excuse me, on two.

00:34:17.572 --> 00:34:18.227
David Boder: Five on two mattresses?

00:34:18.227 --> 00:34:19.836
Nelly Bondy: On two mattresses.

00:34:19.836 --> 00:34:20.983
David Boder: Ja...well?

00:34:20.983 --> 00:34:29.930
Nelly Bondy: Well, we remained there for two...ah...I think the beginning of March, and then were sent on to the...to a camp of Taucha[?] near Leipzig.

00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:30.605
David Boder: Kancha?

00:34:30.605 --> 00:34:31.549
Nelly Bondy: Taucha.

00:34:31.549 --> 00:34:32.473
David Boder: Kaucha...

00:34:32.473 --> 00:34:34.209
Nelly Bondy: It’s five kilometers from Leipzig.

00:34:34.209 --> 00:34:35.143
David Boder: You spell it K-R...

00:34:35.143 --> 00:34:37.377
Nelly Bondy: T-A-U-C-H-A

00:34:37.377 --> 00:34:39.900
David Boder: Yes. All right.

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:51.713
Nelly Bondy: Well, these conditions were better. We had...ah...one bed for two and even the food was better. It was cleanly cooked and after this camp of Malchow...eh...

00:34:51.713 --> 00:34:52.063
David Boder: Ja...

00:34:52.063 --> 00:34:52.957
Nelly Bondy: . . . it seemed a paradise.

00:34:52.957 --> 00:34:53.987
David Boder: Well, were you doing some work?

00:34:53.987 --> 00:34:58.282
Nelly Bondy: We didn’t. No. We couldn’t. We couldn’t work. We were much too exhausted and...we couldn’t work.

00:34:58.282 --> 00:35:02.551
David Boder: You were exhausted. By the way, you wear glasses. Did you have your glasses with you in camp?

00:35:02.551 --> 00:35:04.135
Nelly Bondy: Well, they took them away.

00:35:04.135 --> 00:35:04.830
David Boder: They took your glasses?

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:15.318
Nelly Bondy: They took them away. I got other ones later on because, as a special office worker, I write with glasses, of course. I couldn’t go...glasses for my eyes. And they spoiled my eyes with them...

00:35:15.318 --> 00:35:15.420
David Boder: Oh, I see.

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.775
Nelly Bondy: . . . because now I have to wear the...the glasses all the time; but formerly I didn’t.

00:35:18.775 --> 00:35:20.806
David Boder: Aha...yes...

00:35:20.806 --> 00:35:22.882
Nelly Bondy: They even took away my toothbrush.

00:35:22.882 --> 00:35:24.354
David Boder: Took away your toothbrush?

00:35:24.354 --> 00:35:25.816
Nelly Bondy: Yes. Everything. Absolutely everything.

00:35:25.816 --> 00:35:26.984
David Boder: Ja...

00:35:26.984 --> 00:35:46.832
Nelly Bondy: Well,...ah...in...ah...Taucha we remained only for ten days and then there we were marched on; but we didn’t know where to, because we knew...Of course, we never had a newspaper but the rumors were spreading around rather quickly, but...ah...my...unfortunately very exaggerated rumors and...ah...according...

00:35:46.832 --> 00:35:47.868
David Boder: Unfortunately?

00:35:47.868 --> 00:35:50.091
Nelly Bondy: Unfortunately. The rumors were exaggerated.

00:35:50.091 --> 00:35:50.741
David Boder: Ja...

00:35:50.741 --> 00:35:57.250
Nelly Bondy: Because according to the ones of...ah...the Americans were in Leipzig and the Russians were approaching from the other side. We never knew...

00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:57.560
David Boder: The truth.

00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.139
Nelly Bondy: . . . what is what. Yes.

00:35:59.139 --> 00:36:00.596
David Boder: Ja...did the Nazis know?

00:36:00.596 --> 00:36:00.895
Nelly Bondy: No.

00:36:00.895 --> 00:36:02.022
David Boder: Did the guards know?

00:36:02.022 --> 00:36:04.093
Nelly Bondy: The guards knew, of course, but they didn’t tell us.

00:36:04.093 --> 00:36:05.220
David Boder: Aha...

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:21.449
Nelly Bondy: Well, we had to leave Taucha one evening very quickly and I had a lot of trouble because I couldn’t walk. My foot had been frozen and I had very difficulty to walk. I...I marched along with them for two days but then I simply couldn’t and I knew I would be shot.

00:36:21.449 --> 00:36:21.606
David Boder: Ja...

00:36:21.606 --> 00:36:23.048
Nelly Bondy: So I escaped.

00:36:23.048 --> 00:36:24.637
David Boder: How?

00:36:24.637 --> 00:36:33.967
Nelly Bondy: We were then in a town called Oschatz, which is between Leipzig and Dresden. And they had moved us there to a kind of stadium.

00:36:33.967 --> 00:36:35.714
David Boder: Yes...Sportpalast.

00:36:35.714 --> 00:36:36.673
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:36:36.673 --> 00:36:36.866
David Boder: Ja...

00:36:36.866 --> 00:36:43.658
Nelly Bondy: It was elevated. It was outside of the town and a bit elevated, and so we had a view of the town.

00:36:43.658 --> 00:36:44.491
David Boder: Yes...

00:36:44.491 --> 00:36:49.867
Nelly Bondy: There were stairs leading downstairs and they had a Nazi guard on every “kind” of staircase.

00:36:49.867 --> 00:36:52.573
David Boder: And what kind of clothing were you wearing?

00:36:52.573 --> 00:36:54.720
Nelly Bondy: Well, I had my own clothing...

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:55.035
David Boder: How? It didn’t have stripes?

00:36:55.035 --> 00:36:58.421
Nelly Bondy: . . . because in one of the camps...I have no...no, I had no more stripes.

00:36:58.421 --> 00:37:07.533
Nelly Bondy: I had got a dress, a civilian dress...a civilian dress [repeats] with a big black...no...with a big white cross marked with a painting on the...on the back.

00:37:07.533 --> 00:37:07.736
David Boder: Ja...

00:37:07.736 --> 00:37:09.747
Nelly Bondy: But I didn’t want it on so I put the cross inside.

00:37:09.747 --> 00:37:11.661
David Boder: Ja...who gave you that dress?

00:37:11.661 --> 00:37:15.605
Nelly Bondy: In one of the camps, in Malchow. I had been to the...hospital...

00:37:15.605 --> 00:37:15.676
David Boder: Yes...

00:37:15.676 --> 00:37:16.559
Nelly Bondy: . . . because of my foot.

00:37:16.559 --> 00:37:16.661
David Boder: Ja...

00:37:16.661 --> 00:37:21.276
Nelly Bondy: They had taken away all my...my dresses, and when I got out from the hospital I got that dress.

00:37:21.276 --> 00:37:23.043
David Boder: Ja...

00:37:23.043 --> 00:37:27.434
Nelly Bondy: And I had made a kind of a jacket from my cover.

00:37:27.434 --> 00:37:27.906
David Boder: Ja...

00:37:27.906 --> 00:37:29.216
Nelly Bondy: I had made it myself.

00:37:29.216 --> 00:37:30.510
David Boder: Yes.

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:40.123
Nelly Bondy: And we got our escape. Well, there was a...an airplane attack. These were American airplanes who were attacking the place and there was a kind of a...

00:37:40.123 --> 00:37:41.133
David Boder: Panic?

00:37:41.133 --> 00:37:53.514
Nelly Bondy: . . . panic. Yes. And suddenly I say that one of the staircases were not guarded, so I went downstairs quietly, and downstairs I found a...how do you call it in the Fren—...ah...in English? An abri [shelter].

00:37:53.514 --> 00:37:54.047
David Boder: What?

00:37:54.047 --> 00:37:55.159
Nelly Bondy: An abri.

00:37:55.159 --> 00:37:55.530
David Boder: . . . oh!

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:56.804
Nelly Bondy: A Luftschutz [?] Keller.

00:37:56.804 --> 00:37:57.159
David Boder: What?

00:37:57.159 --> 00:37:58.388
Nelly Bondy: A Luftschutz [?] Keller.

00:37:58.388 --> 00:38:04.180
David Boder: Uh-huh...aha...an anti-air raid...shelter.

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:04.926
Nelly Bondy: That’s it. Yes. There...

00:38:04.926 --> 00:38:05.617
David Boder: An air raid shelter.

00:38:05.617 --> 00:38:22.536
Nelly Bondy: Yes. I found it by chance. I didn’t what it was and I went there and I heard some voices and I was rather [?] afraid. But it was too late. The people were coming near so I couldn’t do anything but just stay down there. Well, they took me for a civilian or they pretended about it. I didn’t know.

00:38:22.536 --> 00:38:23.551
David Boder: Yes...

00:38:23.551 --> 00:38:24.592
Nelly Bondy: And I stayed there till...

00:38:24.592 --> 00:38:26.602
David Boder: Oh, was the air raid shelter for people?

00:38:26.602 --> 00:38:27.658
Nelly Bondy: Yes, for civilians.

00:38:27.658 --> 00:38:30.917
David Boder: Yes. Outside the camp.

00:38:30.917 --> 00:38:34.054
Nelly Bondy: Yes. It was out of the camp. There was...it was no camp, you see. It was just a...

00:38:34.054 --> 00:38:37.354
David Boder: Then was it a kind of an armory? Was it?

00:38:37.354 --> 00:38:40.476
Nelly Bondy: No. It was an open place. It was a stadium—a sport place.

00:38:40.476 --> 00:38:43.182
David Boder: Oh. Oh...just a open...

00:38:43.182 --> 00:38:43.989
Nelly Bondy: Yes. Open air.

00:38:43.989 --> 00:38:46.690
David Boder: Yes, a open air stadium; and there they kept you?

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:51.416
Nelly Bondy: And there they kept us just in order to...to give us some rest. We marched the whole night.

00:38:51.416 --> 00:38:53.167
David Boder: Oh, oh, oh, yes...

00:38:53.167 --> 00:38:55.523
Nelly Bondy: And it was the [by the] moon that we should get up again...

00:38:55.523 --> 00:38:55.691
David Boder: Ja...

00:38:55.691 --> 00:38:58.569
Nelly Bondy: . . . but we had nothing to eat, you see. They didn’t give us anything to eat.

00:38:58.569 --> 00:38:59.402
David Boder: Yes...

00:38:59.402 --> 00:39:06.382
Nelly Bondy: So I went downstairs there in this panic and I got into this shelter and I remained there till the thing was over.

00:39:06.382 --> 00:39:07.747
David Boder: Hum...

00:39:07.747 --> 00:39:10.143
Nelly Bondy: I met some prisoners of war.

00:39:10.143 --> 00:39:10.773
David Boder: Yes...

00:39:10.773 --> 00:39:27.302
Nelly Bondy: They were Dutch and I asked for a French one, and they brought along a French one who asked if I had escaped from upstairs. I said ‘Yes,” and if he could do anything for me. He said he couldn’t personally, but I should get...try to get out of the country. There were lots of French prisoners of war, and...ah...

00:39:27.302 --> 00:39:29.942
David Boder: Also...also those who ran away.

00:39:29.942 --> 00:39:32.861
Nelly Bondy: No. They were just...working in the camps or the fields, or so.

00:39:32.861 --> 00:39:33.922
David Boder: Yes. And?

00:39:33.922 --> 00:39:37.450
Nelly Bondy: And...if I trust one of them they would surely help me.

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:39.404
David Boder: Ja...

00:39:39.404 --> 00:39:43.191
Nelly Bondy: But I was so weak I couldn’t walk, so when the thing was over...

00:39:43.191 --> 00:39:43.938
David Boder: You couldn’t walk?

00:39:43.938 --> 00:39:45.050
Nelly Bondy: I couldn’t walk. No.

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:45.349
David Boder: Yes...

00:39:45.349 --> 00:40:11.221
Nelly Bondy: . . . because of my foot. When the...when the attack was over I...I just went...marched out of the thing. There was a Nazi guard...on the...at the entrance; but he didn’t...he...pay any attention to me. So I walked out. And I went to the church. I had located the church from upstairs. You see, from this place I knew about the direction. I went in there, and I remained there for three days.

00:40:11.221 --> 00:40:13.445
David Boder: How did you remain in the church?

00:40:13.445 --> 00:40:17.095
Nelly Bondy: I hid between benches downstairs. You see, I lay down on the floor.

00:40:17.095 --> 00:40:18.389
David Boder: Didn’t people come by...

00:40:18.389 --> 00:40:18.511
Nelly Bondy: Yes, they did.

00:40:18.511 --> 00:40:19.455
David Boder: . . . for services?

00:40:19.455 --> 00:40:20.247
Nelly Bondy: Yes, they did.

00:40:20.247 --> 00:40:20.724
David Boder: Was it a Catholic...ah...

00:40:20.724 --> 00:40:22.217
Nelly Bondy: It was...no, it was a Protestant Church.

00:40:22.217 --> 00:40:25.176
David Boder: A Protestant Church. People were coming for service?

00:40:25.176 --> 00:40:29.674
Nelly Bondy: Eh...there was no...there was just...there was...there wasn’t...[interference of some kind]

00:40:29.674 --> 00:40:35.435
David Boder: You say you went into the church and spent...you went into a church and spent three days.

00:40:35.435 --> 00:40:36.779
Nelly Bondy: Yes. I lay down...

00:40:36.779 --> 00:40:39.424
David Boder: Now let us stop here. I will check the reel.

00:40:39.424 --> 00:40:40.322
Nelly Bondy: OK.

00:40:40.322 --> 00:40:46.180
David Boder: This is a Illinois Institute of Technology recording. Paris, August the 22nd?

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:46.815
Nelly Bondy: Yes...

00:40:46.815 --> 00:40:51.524
David Boder: August...[ends abruptly]

00:40:51.524 --> 00:41:08.506
David Boder: Thursday, August the 22nd, in Paris; 22nd, 1946. It is a continuation of Spool 60. Mrs. Nelly Bondy...reporting. All right, Mrs. Bondy. So you...

00:41:08.506 --> 00:41:10.988
Nelly Bondy: Well, I think I was at the church, didn’t I?

00:41:10.988 --> 00:41:14.816
David Boder: You...you...you ran away during a air raid.

00:41:14.816 --> 00:41:15.187
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:41:15.187 --> 00:41:28.531
David Boder: You hid in a air raid shelter, as far as I remember. You came out. You manage...eh...you met...you met a French prisoner who suggested that there are French prisoners on the countryside and that all was where, in...What was the name of the place?

00:41:28.531 --> 00:41:31.612
Nelly Bondy: Yes, that was...ah...Oschatz, near Leipzig.

00:41:31.612 --> 00:41:37.131
David Boder: Near Leipzig. In Oschatz near Leipzig; and you went to a church, and you hid in a church for three days.

00:41:37.131 --> 00:41:37.649
Nelly Bondy: I...that’s it. Yes.

00:41:37.649 --> 00:41:38.949
David Boder: What were you eating?

00:41:38.949 --> 00:41:45.086
Nelly Bondy: Nothing. I hadn’t got anything more to eat; and that’s why I had to get out finally, because I was hungry.

00:41:45.086 --> 00:41:47.230
David Boder: Did you have anything to drink?

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:48.372
Nelly Bondy: Nothing. No.

00:41:48.372 --> 00:41:53.946
David Boder: Now can you tell me, how does a person feel who starves for three days?

00:41:53.946 --> 00:42:02.301
Nelly Bondy: [automobile honks] Nothing at all. You don’t remember. You don’t think that you have nothing to eat...[?] very rarely, you see.

00:42:02.301 --> 00:42:03.849
David Boder: Did you sleep? [Note: Wire broke. One inch lost. Apparently no words.]

00:42:03.849 --> 00:42:05.250
Nelly Bondy: Yes, I slept a lot.

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:06.641
David Boder: Did you dream that you were eating?

00:42:06.641 --> 00:42:09.301
Nelly Bondy: No. No. I didn’t dream at all. I...

00:42:09.301 --> 00:42:09.827
David Boder: You did not? You did not dream at all?

00:42:09.827 --> 00:42:17.649
Nelly Bondy: No, I was absolutely exhausted. I had been walking with a sore foot for about twenty-four hours.

00:42:17.649 --> 00:42:17.954
David Boder: Yes...

00:42:17.954 --> 00:42:30.004
Nelly Bondy: And I...I couldn’t do anything. I was...my body was aching all over. When I wanted to turn from one side to the other—just remember that...I was on the ground, you see, the wooden ground. It hurt terribly.

00:42:30.004 --> 00:42:30.613
David Boder: Ja...

00:42:30.613 --> 00:42:40.013
Nelly Bondy: And I didn’t...I didn’t even think of eating through the third day. Then I thought I...I was obliged to get something. Otherwise I...I would be sick, or I would be found or something...

00:42:40.013 --> 00:42:40.526
David Boder: Yes.

00:42:40.526 --> 00:42:41.648
Nelly Bondy: So I got...

00:42:41.648 --> 00:42:42.719
David Boder: I went see...[?]

00:42:42.719 --> 00:42:45.024
Nelly Bondy: I went to see the Protestant chaplain.

00:42:45.024 --> 00:42:45.740
David Boder: Yes...

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:54.781
Nelly Bondy: And asked...I told him my story. I was quite...openly and asked him to help me. Well, he would have done, but he was terribly afraid of the Gestapo.

00:42:54.781 --> 00:42:55.990
David Boder: Yes...

00:42:55.990 --> 00:43:06.498
Nelly Bondy: So he just gave me some biscuits and I even wanted to save some for later; he didn’t allow me. He wanted me to eat them immediately because he was afraid if they were found on me they would ask me who...where I had got them from.

00:43:06.498 --> 00:43:07.463
David Boder: Yes...

00:43:07.463 --> 00:43:12.311
Nelly Bondy: Well, he sent me out to a Catholic...to the Catholic...eh...priest.

00:43:12.311 --> 00:43:14.610
David Boder: He spoke German? He was a German?

00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:15.494
Nelly Bondy: A German, of course.

00:43:15.494 --> 00:43:20.910
David Boder: Now tell me something about the conversation. What did he say?

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:28.829
Nelly Bondy: Well, first when I got in we shook hands and he was very polite. “What can I do for you?”

00:43:28.829 --> 00:43:33.768
David Boder: Hum?...he knew? Did you right away tell him who you were?

00:43:33.768 --> 00:43:34.905
Nelly Bondy: Yes, I did.

00:43:34.905 --> 00:43:36.479
David Boder: Did you tell him you were Jewish?

00:43:36.479 --> 00:43:37.723
Nelly Bondy: Ah...no, I didn’t.

00:43:37.723 --> 00:43:39.708
David Boder: No. Did he ask?

00:43:39.708 --> 00:43:42.535
Nelly Bondy: He asked . He asked, but I told him that I was Roman Catholic...

00:43:42.535 --> 00:43:42.637
David Boder: Yes...

00:43:42.637 --> 00:43:44.947
Nelly Bondy: . . . but that my husband had been a Jew—a French Jew.

00:43:44.947 --> 00:43:45.104
David Boder: Yes...

00:43:45.104 --> 00:43:47.490
Nelly Bondy: And that I was born in Vienna, which is a fact.

00:43:47.490 --> 00:43:47.927
David Boder: Yes...

00:43:47.927 --> 00:43:51.211
Nelly Bondy: And...ah...which accounted for my good German, of course.

00:43:51.211 --> 00:43:52.176
David Boder: Yes.

00:43:52.176 --> 00:43:59.663
Nelly Bondy: And he said, “Well, if you are a Catholic...” [pause]

00:43:59.663 --> 00:44:00.980
David Boder: Yes. “If you are Catholic...”

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:03.691
Nelly Bondy: “If you are a Catholic, we have a Roman Catholic priest here.”

00:44:03.691 --> 00:44:04.041
David Boder: Yes...

00:44:04.041 --> 00:44:08.214
Nelly Bondy: I said, “Oh, that’s fine. I didn’t know and I didn’t want to ask so many people.”

00:44:08.214 --> 00:44:08.767
David Boder: Ja...

00:44:08.767 --> 00:44:10.392
Nelly Bondy: So he gave me the address.

00:44:10.392 --> 00:44:10.702
David Boder: Ja...

00:44:10.702 --> 00:44:12.037
Nelly Bondy: And I went to see him.

00:44:12.037 --> 00:44:13.672
David Boder: Was there a Catholic Church in town?

00:44:13.672 --> 00:44:15.535
Nelly Bondy: Yes, there was, but I didn’t see it.

00:44:15.535 --> 00:44:17.114
David Boder: Yes...

00:44:17.114 --> 00:44:22.865
Nelly Bondy: Well, this young priest was very kind, and I told him the same thing.

00:44:22.865 --> 00:44:24.276
David Boder: Did you tell him you were a Catholic?

00:44:24.276 --> 00:44:25.180
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:28.637
David Boder: Do you know...eh...enough of the Catholic religion to...take a chance on it?

00:44:28.637 --> 00:44:30.216
Nelly Bondy: Yes, I know something.

00:44:30.216 --> 00:44:33.500
David Boder: You know. Yes. All right.

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:41.295
Nelly Bondy: He...gave me some money and his mother brought me some food...some...some sandwiches.

00:44:41.295 --> 00:44:44.037
David Boder: And you told him that you were run...running away from the camp?

00:44:44.037 --> 00:44:45.281
Nelly Bondy: Yes, I told him.

00:44:45.281 --> 00:44:45.946
David Boder: Yes...

00:44:45.946 --> 00:44:52.002
Nelly Bondy: He even told me, “You’re not the first one. You’re not the first one. You are the second or the third I’ve...”

00:44:52.002 --> 00:44:55.296
David Boder: The Catholic priest gave you some money, and his mother?

00:44:55.296 --> 00:44:57.885
Nelly Bondy: And his mother gave me some sandwiches.

00:44:57.885 --> 00:44:58.505
David Boder: Yes...

00:44:58.505 --> 00:45:14.876
Nelly Bondy: And he advised me to get out of the town—to get to the country. And I did, and I walked...ah...for an hour or two; but I didn’t get very far because I couldn’t walk. Always the same thing, and so I fell down in the ditch near the road.

00:45:14.876 --> 00:45:16.257
David Boder: Yes...

00:45:16.257 --> 00:45:27.709
Nelly Bondy: Well, there I was lying there for I don’t know how many...I don’t know how long a time, till somebody came up to me and asked me what I...what I was doing here. So I...I told him that I was...taking a rest.

00:45:27.709 --> 00:45:29.425
David Boder: Ja...and who was it?

00:45:29.425 --> 00:45:35.158
Nelly Bondy: He was a refugee from...ah...Russian-occupied Germany.

00:45:35.158 --> 00:45:36.889
David Boder: And was he...also running away?

00:45:36.889 --> 00:45:39.280
Nelly Bondy: No, he was a civilian.

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:39.549
David Boder: Ja...

00:45:39.549 --> 00:45:43.407
Nelly Bondy: He had been evacuat—...evacuated till there by the government.

00:45:43.407 --> 00:45:44.844
David Boder: Yes...

00:45:44.844 --> 00:46:05.829
Nelly Bondy: And I asked him at the same time if he couldn’t...ah...leave [give] me a room to sleep in this night. I explained to him that I had hurt my leg and that I couldn’t walk; and he said, “You see, we are very crowded and my wife and myself. We are just refugees and we haven’t got any room for ourselves. You just go and see the mayor.” Of course...

00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:06.403
David Boder: The mayor?

00:46:06.403 --> 00:46:07.109
Nelly Bondy: The mayor. Yes.

00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:07.490
David Boder: Ja...

00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:09.526
Nelly Bondy: That was the least of things I wanted to do.

00:46:09.526 --> 00:46:10.232
David Boder: Yes.

00:46:10.232 --> 00:46:33.147
Nelly Bondy: But...there wasn’t anything for me to do to leave here; and then there came a friend of his with a bicycle, and so his friend took me on the bicycle and led me to the mayor. The mayor wasn’t there, but his wife was there; and I told her that I had...I had to be...to be someplace. I couldn’t walk. That I was a refugee myself from...I don’t remember what I told her.

00:46:33.147 --> 00:46:34.167
David Boder: Ja...

00:46:34.167 --> 00:46:43.273
Nelly Bondy: And she advised me to go to “that and that” hotel and to get a room there. Well, I didn’t get a room, but I was sent to a big dormitory where there were many other refugees.

00:46:43.273 --> 00:46:45.283
David Boder: Oh, there were already German refugees at that time?

00:46:45.283 --> 00:46:46.964
Nelly Bondy: Yes. Civilian. Oh, lots of them, of course.

00:46:46.964 --> 00:46:47.771
David Boder: Yes...

00:46:47.771 --> 00:46:49.365
Nelly Bondy: That was in...April.

00:46:49.365 --> 00:46:50.949
David Boder: Yes, in ’45.

00:46:50.949 --> 00:46:51.756
Nelly Bondy: ’45.

00:46:51.756 --> 00:46:52.883
David Boder: Ja...

00:46:52.883 --> 00:46:55.117
Nelly Bondy: Well, I got there into a big...

00:46:55.117 --> 00:46:57.493
David Boder: And all in that dress—in that blue dress from the hospital?

00:46:57.493 --> 00:47:19.477
Nelly Bondy: Yes, yes. Well, they took...they took me...they took me up very friendly and were very kind and I remained there for...and I told the landlord that I would go away the next morning. Well, I slept till noon, and...I tried to get away but I couldn’t walk, so I turned back.

00:47:19.477 --> 00:47:21.345
David Boder: Hm...

00:47:21.345 --> 00:47:22.360
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:26.562
David Boder: And you told the landlord that...you told the landlord that you are going away?

00:47:26.562 --> 00:47:48.004
Nelly Bondy: Yes. I tried to get away but, as I couldn’t walk, I turned back and told him if he could keep me another night. The landlord wasn’t in and his wife said, “Why yes, of course. Just get up again and come on down.” I did but...an hour or so later the landlord came [unintelligible] and ask me for papers.

00:47:48.004 --> 00:47:48.811
David Boder: Hm...

00:47:48.811 --> 00:47:53.156
Nelly Bondy: Well, I hadn’t got any papers, and I told him that I had...ah...lost them all.

00:47:53.156 --> 00:47:53.451
David Boder: Ja...

00:47:53.451 --> 00:48:37.455
Nelly Bondy: So he said, “Well, if you have lost them we’ll call for the police, because...you understand we are at wartime and there are a lot of spies getting around everywhere and...we’ll see to that.” And he told the others to take care that I shouldn’t run away. Well, there was no danger for that because I had a high fever. I felt it an...well, I fell back on my straw and I slept. And I was wakened up by two policemen who asked me what...what I was doing here and how I had come here and so on. Well, I told them the same thing, that I had escaped from Leipzig because the Russians had taken Leipzig, and...ah...they asked for my name. I gave my maiden name. And they asked for the address. What I’m trying to do—

00:48:37.455 --> 00:48:39.084
David Boder: Your...your maiden name is Strasser.

00:48:39.084 --> 00:48:40.272
Nelly Bondy: Yes. It’s a German name—Strasser.

00:48:40.272 --> 00:48:42.171
David Boder: Yes, yes...

00:48:42.171 --> 00:48:58.156
Nelly Bondy: Well, they asked what I was doing in Leipzig. I knew that there was a factory for munitions in Taucha where I had been in camp, because...ah...comrades of mine had been working there. And I knew, too, that the Americans are already there so he couldn’t...

00:48:58.156 --> 00:48:58.709
David Boder: Verify?

00:48:58.709 --> 00:49:24.226
Nelly Bondy: . . . check. Yes.

00:49:24.226 --> 00:49:25.522
David Boder: All right.

00:49:25.522 --> 00:50:01.989
Nelly Bondy: Well, anyway, I invented a street according to the name of this station, you see, and it worked out all right. There seems to be a street like that in Leipzig, and...ah...that was all he asked me; but he said he couldn’t...”You can’t remain...that’s all right now. We’ll leave you alone, but you remain here without papers.” So I said, “What shall I do?” “Well, we don’t know. We don’t know. Anyway, you can’t...you can’t...roam the country without any papers.” So I proposed myself, I’d get back to Oschatz and see the NSV, which was the Nazi Social Volkswohlfahrt, you see.

00:50:01.989 --> 00:50:02.355
David Boder: Yes.

00:50:02.355 --> 00:50:15.345
Nelly Bondy: And...I suggested that I could see him and ask him if he could help me. And they thought that was a good idea. And next morning I was getting away to Oschatz in the [rumbling noises] milk van. The...the town was taking...just taking the milk to...to town [?] [unintelligible].

00:50:15.345 --> 00:50:16.467
David Boder: He was walking?

00:50:16.467 --> 00:50:20.898
Nelly Bondy: No. On the car. On the car which was taking the milk to the town.

00:50:20.898 --> 00:50:21.569
David Boder: Yes. [noises end]

00:50:21.569 --> 00:50:27.564
Nelly Bondy: And...ah...they took me along, and I really dropped into the.. this social...Nazi social...

00:50:27.564 --> 00:50:28.067
David Boder: . . . welfare?

00:50:28.067 --> 00:50:40.347
Nelly Bondy: . . . welfare, office and told them about the lost papers and they said I should...should go to the town hall. Well, I did, and I signed a declaration de [unintelligible French word, obviously an affidavit].

00:50:40.347 --> 00:50:41.174
David Boder: That they...that the...

00:50:41.174 --> 00:50:41.428
Nelly Bondy: That...ah...

00:50:41.428 --> 00:50:42.890
David Boder: [In German] that you have lost...

00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:50.944
Nelly Bondy: [In English] Yes, that I had lost all my papers and I invented all kinds of...of ration stamps and...ah...they were printed so I filled out everything, you see.

00:50:50.944 --> 00:50:51.477
David Boder: Yes...

00:50:51.477 --> 00:50:51.878
Nelly Bondy: And I told...

00:50:51.878 --> 00:50:53.858
David Boder: But didn’t you have you tattoo?

00:50:53.858 --> 00:50:55.508
Nelly Bondy: Yes, but I had long sleeves.

00:50:55.508 --> 00:50:55.716
David Boder: Yes.

00:50:55.716 --> 00:50:58.579
Nelly Bondy: It happened that they didn’t...they didn’t have the idea to ask for that.

00:50:58.579 --> 00:51:01.513
David Boder: Ja...and you filled out...

00:51:01.513 --> 00:51:14.905
Nelly Bondy: I filled out that and...ah...they sent...that was the town hall. Then they sent me to the police. I went there, and he just told me, “Well, I can’t help you. If you lo—...if you lose you papers I can’t help you now. You know very well that you can’t get them back.”

00:51:14.905 --> 00:51:15.314
David Boder: Hm...

00:51:15.314 --> 00:51:18.037
Nelly Bondy: Well, anyway...

00:51:18.037 --> 00:51:18.347
David Boder: Ja...

00:51:18.347 --> 00:51:32.860
Nelly Bondy: I asked him, “That’s...that’s all right; but I’ve got to go to sleep some place. I can’t walk and I haven’t eaten for two days and I’m hungry and I’m sleepy and it’s...they...you must tell me where to go to sleep.” So they indicated [to]me a kind of school, kind of...sort of a shelter [?]...

00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:33.267
David Boder: Yes...

00:51:33.267 --> 00:52:02.700
Nelly Bondy: . . . for German civilians, and he told me again [?], “I don’t know if the Director will take you in without papers, but you might try.” I went there and saw the Director, and...the same thing, “I can’t take you without...without papers.” So I said, “Li—...listen, I have been to see the police and they told me to see you.” So he said, “Well, I’ll take you until tomorrow, but I’ll ask for some—an identification [?] paper for you from the police. Do you...do recall this to me this afternoon.” I said, “OK.”

00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:03.944
David Boder: Remind me this afternoon?

00:52:03.944 --> 00:52:04.406
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:52:04.406 --> 00:52:05.822
David Boder: Ja...

00:52:05.822 --> 00:52:19.314
Nelly Bondy: Well, he put me into a small room. There were mattresses, and I got two covers, and it was clean. Everything was all right. We were about...ah...perhaps fifteen people in this room. It was a school room.

00:52:19.314 --> 00:52:19.608
David Boder: Yes...

00:52:19.608 --> 00:52:48.967
Nelly Bondy: And...ah...in the afternoon there came a German sanitary officer. So...and he looked at me and I must have a high fever and I must have looked very flushed, because he came to me and said, “What’s wrong with you? Anything wrong?” I said, “Yes, my foot.” “Let me see that.” Well, you see, I hadn’t taken off my shoe for several days and I was really most unhappy when I saw this foot. It was sore and swollen and he saw and he...he told me, “We’ll have to get you to the hospital.”

00:52:48.967 --> 00:52:49.825
David Boder: Hum...

00:52:49.825 --> 00:52:52.206
Nelly Bondy: But I didn’t want to [go] there because of this tattoo.

00:52:52.206 --> 00:52:52.374
David Boder: Yes.

00:52:52.374 --> 00:52:55.506
Nelly Bondy: I was afraid. If I had to take off my clothes, then everything would be...ah...

00:52:55.506 --> 00:52:56.100
David Boder: Ja...

00:52:56.100 --> 00:53:15.369
Nelly Bondy: . . . bad. So...ah...I insisted on...on just remaining and I say, “If you leave me alone and just...ah...leave me alone on this mattress and if I haven’t got to walk for miles and miles it will be all right.” Well, I succeeded, and he...he made me a...a bandage he...

00:53:15.369 --> 00:53:15.593
David Boder: Ja...

00:53:15.593 --> 00:53:25.435
Nelly Bondy: . . . disinfected it and made me a good bandage and told me, “Now certainly don’t move and just remain...remain...stretched out. Don’t walk on this foot.”

00:53:25.435 --> 00:53:27.415
David Boder: Was he a physician?

00:53:27.415 --> 00:53:29.527
Nelly Bondy: Well see, he must have been a student of medicine, you see.

00:53:29.527 --> 00:53:30.517
David Boder: Ja, a medico or something.

00:53:30.517 --> 00:53:58.918
Nelly Bondy: Yes, a medical student, probably. Well, the director orders him [listened to him] and...and I said to him, “You see, you wanted me...you wanted me to remind you of this paper for me for the police.” He said, “Yes, that’s all right,” and he said, “You...” I had to go to the police tomorrow for my papers. So he says, “No, you won’t bother. Don’t bother. You just remain here and I’ll take care of that,” and then said...ah...in quite another tone, “Well, you see, I didn’t know your foot was as bad as that.”

00:53:58.918 --> 00:53:59.365
David Boder: Hm...

00:53:59.365 --> 00:54:00.736
Nelly Bondy: “Kindly excuse.”

00:54:00.736 --> 00:54:01.594
David Boder: Ja...

00:54:01.594 --> 00:54:32.341
Nelly Bondy: Well, I remained there for a few days, but suddenly it was...well, then they even opened a kind of hospital for me. There was another lady, too, who had some...something wrong with her foot and we were put there. I was afraid to have...to have had to undress and they would see my tattoo, but this kind of hospital, a kind of nursery, was not much better than this big room except that there were nurses and hadn’t [to?] go and fetch our food ourselves.

00:54:32.341 --> 00:55:03.946
Nelly Bondy: We remained there for...I remained there for a week or so and then the Russians were approaching and we were told to evacuate the...the town. I tried to walk. I couldn’t so I turned back. It was four in the morning. I turned back into my bed and remained there. A nurse found me at five in the morning and said, “But dear me, you...you can’t stay. You must get away.” I said, “I can’t walk.” So she told me there was a train leaving at six. The station was not very far away and she said it would be better on the train if I would be able to walk to the station. I said yes. Well, they put...

00:55:03.946 --> 00:55:05.763
David Boder: They took you, of course, for a Christian?

00:55:05.763 --> 00:55:05.891
Nelly Bondy: Of course.

00:55:05.891 --> 00:55:06.201
David Boder: For a Catholic?

00:55:06.201 --> 00:55:06.379
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:55:06.379 --> 00:55:06.914
David Boder: Yes...

00:55:06.914 --> 00:55:07.673
Nelly Bondy: For a Catholic. For a German.

00:55:07.673 --> 00:55:09.105
David Boder: For a civilian evacuee?

00:55:09.105 --> 00:55:09.628
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

00:55:09.628 --> 00:55:10.283
David Boder: Ja...

00:55:10.283 --> 00:55:20.207
Nelly Bondy: Yes. Otherwise I would never have managed. I got on this train, and when we got off from the train we had to walk. I had a...

00:55:20.207 --> 00:55:22.182
David Boder: Well, how long did you go on that train?

00:55:22.182 --> 00:55:27.080
Nelly Bondy: Not very far, about...ah...fifteen, twenty-five kilometer.

00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:27.183
David Boder: Ja...

00:55:27.183 --> 00:55:46.609
Nelly Bondy: It wasn’t very far, and...ah...I had heard on the train that the town of Grimma was occupied by the Americans. So I had...ah...made up my mind to go there; and when we got off the train I asked where it was. So they told me, “It’s this way, but you can’t get there. It’s occupied by the enemy.”

00:55:46.609 --> 00:55:47.568
David Boder: Yes...

00:55:47.568 --> 00:55:58.672
Nelly Bondy: Well, I was...I didn’t...I went all the same. I took the direction and...ah...once on the way I was stopped. He said, “Where do you want to go?” I said, “I want to go there.” “You can’t!” “Why?”

00:55:58.672 --> 00:55:59.977
David Boder: Who stopped you?

00:55:59.977 --> 00:56:02.084
Nelly Bondy: It was a...

00:56:02.084 --> 00:56:02.962
David Boder: Militia?

00:56:02.962 --> 00:56:10.328
Nelly Bondy: I don’t remember if it was a Nazi guard or who it was. Yes. It was some person in a uniform. I forgot. I don’t know what it was. Wehrmacht something.

00:56:10.328 --> 00:56:12.348
David Boder: Yes...

00:56:12.348 --> 00:56:38.229
Nelly Bondy: He said, “You can’t go there. It’s occupied.” I said, “But where should I go to? I’ve been turning around for weeks or months now. I’ve had quite enough of this stuff. I want, even if it’s occupied by the American, I don’t want...I don’t mind, and I’ll get there and settle down someplace. I’ve got enough and I...I don’t want to...to be...to continue walking on the...on the road.” He said, “But you can’t. You can’t. Its verboten. Well, some...then somebody else was arguing with him and I slipped behind his back and I went on all the same.

00:56:38.229 --> 00:56:41.635
David Boder: Ja...and what was the other arguing with? The same thing?

00:56:41.635 --> 00:56:42.711
Nelly Bondy: The same thing, of course.

00:56:42.711 --> 00:56:44.853
David Boder: Ja...

00:56:44.853 --> 00:56:57.722
Nelly Bondy: I went on and I came to a...to a small place where there was a kind of a shelter again for civilians. That’s a kind of place where you take in people, you see, German civilians who were displaced.

00:56:57.722 --> 00:57:00.631
David Boder: Ja...a Herberge.

00:57:00.631 --> 00:57:02.220
Nelly Bondy: Well, yes. Ah...

00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:03.210
David Boder: A shelter house?

00:57:03.210 --> 00:57:05.916
Nelly Bondy: A shelter house. It was a school which was turned...which had been turned...

00:57:05.916 --> 00:57:07.139
David Boder: Eh...turned in a shelter house.

00:57:07.139 --> 00:57:44.866
Nelly Bondy: There was a...there was a great disorder. Nobody was asking any questions so I took just a bed which was free and I put myself there, and at noon I went to fetch some soup and...ah...that nobody took care of me. Next morning, at ten the next morning, somebody told us...we have to get away, to get back to Oschatz where we came from because the Americans had...the Russians...no. The Americans did not approach here, but Oschatz had not been taken in by the Russians so we had to get back. Well, when we got out I just...there was a “crucial way,” you see, at the...on the right.

00:57:44.866 --> 00:57:45.643
David Boder: A cross road, yes?

00:57:45.643 --> 00:58:14.116
Nelly Bondy: A cross road on my...on the right. The direction was unmarkunge [unmarked] and to my left it was back to Oschatz, so I found out where to go. I didn’t want to go back and I was afraid to go ahead because I was afraid that people who would...who would...join the enemy would be shot. So I didn’t want to be shot after two years of Auschwitz, and I was just thinking it over when I saw a group of French prisoners of war who were taking this road. So I called to them, “Where are you going?”

00:58:14.116 --> 00:58:14.817
David Boder: In French?

00:58:14.817 --> 00:58:26.787
Nelly Bondy: French, yes. “Why, of course, to the Americans.” I said, “Oh, I’ll...I’ll join you.” “Well, come along if you want to.” And they waited for me. They were a group of four men and two women, and...

00:58:26.787 --> 00:58:27.752
David Boder: French women?

00:58:27.752 --> 00:58:29.006
Nelly Bondy: Yes, French prisoners of war.

00:58:29.006 --> 00:58:29.377
David Boder: Ja...

00:58:29.377 --> 00:58:30.093
Nelly Bondy: Political prisoners.

00:58:30.093 --> 00:58:31.621
David Boder: Yes...

00:58:31.621 --> 00:58:44.480
Nelly Bondy: And they were going...they were marching there and they took me along but then I saw that they would march much quicker without me because I...I was...ah...walking in a slipper which a soldier...a German soldier had given me. I couldn’t even take my...my shoe off.

00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:45.074
David Boder: Ja...

00:58:45.074 --> 00:59:13.172
Nelly Bondy: So I said to them, “I don’t want to bother you. You just walk ahead and I’ll follow you even if its some distance. It’s of not importance.” But this group was nice. It was my good luck because they slipped through everywhere. There were German troops on the roads and who were taking in civilians and they were some...some paces ahead of me and every time when I came that...some such post I said, “Well, I belong to this group. I’m a French political prisoner,” and that was all right, so I slipped through.

00:59:13.172 --> 00:59:15.624
David Boder: And how did they let the French go through?

00:59:15.624 --> 00:59:19.700
Nelly Bondy: Yes, they let the French political...the...the men wore uniforms, you see.

00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:20.715
David Boder: And they let them go to the American...

00:59:20.715 --> 00:59:23.725
Nelly Bondy: They let them go, yes. Well, the war was more or less over.

00:59:23.725 --> 00:59:23.964
David Boder: Aha...

00:59:23.964 --> 00:59:26.086
Nelly Bondy: It was end...it was end of April...

00:59:26.086 --> 00:59:26.188
David Boder: Yes.

00:59:26.188 --> 00:59:28.315
Nelly Bondy: They knew there was something...there was nothing to be done.

00:59:28.315 --> 00:59:28.939
David Boder: Ja...

00:59:28.939 --> 00:59:55.407
Nelly Bondy: Well, I had to walk a long way. I had to walk some twenty-five kilometers till I reached...ah...Grimma in Saxony. Grimma is not very far from Leipzig. Well...ah...there was a bridge which had been blown up by the Germans when they retreated. The bridge was...ah...part of the bridge was going down into the water, and the Ger—...the Americans had put ladders up there and that was how people got over.

00:59:55.407 --> 00:59:55.743
David Boder: Ja...

00:59:55.743 --> 01:00:42.780
Nelly Bondy: And there were American guards. I came to see them and...ah...I spoke English and asked them if I could get over. “But who are you?” I said, “I’m a French political prisoner.” “Well, I’ll ask the captain for that. I haven’t got any instructions for you. We just have instructions to pass over the prisoners of war.” The captain came back and told me, “I’m extremely sorry for you, but so far I haven’t got any instructions for political prisoners, just for prisoners of war.” I said, “What shall I do? I haven’t any money. I haven’t got any papers. I have got nothing to eat. Couldn’t you take me over? I have a bad foot and I need a doctor.” “I’m extremely sorry, I can’t. I can’t. Come back tomorrow. Perhaps I’ll have such instructions by then.” Next morning I came back. Yes, I slept...

01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:43.851
David Boder: Where did you spend the night?

01:00:43.851 --> 01:01:26.893
Nelly Bondy: Yes. Yes. Just...I want to talk about that. I found a group of Italians and I speak Italian so I...ah...they took me in. They gave me something to eat and they had a kind of barn where they were sleeping. They were five or six, and they arranged a corner for me, and I spent the night there. Next morning I went down again to the bridge and asked the captain again, but he said “No, no. I haven’t got any instructions as yet. It might last two or three days.” And he suggested that I should go to the country to a farm and to remain there, but I found a kind of barn in a house which had been bombed out, but part of it was still standing. So I found a room there and I was quite, more or less comfortable up there.

01:01:26.893 --> 01:01:28.431
David Boder: What did you eat?

01:01:28.431 --> 01:01:49.302
Nelly Bondy: There was a...there was another group of French prisoners who brought us something to eat. I don’t know how they managed to...to get food, but they did get it. There was one who came up every day with some...ah...meat or some vegetables and they “entertained” a kind of stove in a...in a big bucket...

01:01:49.302 --> 01:01:49.449
David Boder: Ja...

01:01:49.449 --> 01:01:52.820
Nelly Bondy: . . . which had been used to...to wash the laundry.

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:53.800
David Boder: They improvised a stove?

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:54.333
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

01:01:54.333 --> 01:01:55.130
David Boder: Yes...

01:01:55.130 --> 01:02:10.785
Nelly Bondy: They had...they put some iron [?] material on the bottom and then they took doors and window frames and everything that was available in wood and they cut it and they entertained this, and so I had a continual...continual stove. You see, I could always...

01:02:10.785 --> 01:02:11.079
David Boder: Warm yourself?

01:02:11.079 --> 01:02:14.282
Nelly Bondy: . . . warm some water, warm myself and so...

01:02:14.282 --> 01:02:16.627
David Boder: Oh, they maintained it for you?

01:02:16.627 --> 01:02:19.725
Nelly Bondy: They...no. They didn’t maintain it. They just brought me fuel.

01:02:19.725 --> 01:02:20.583
David Boder: Fuel, and you were...ah...

01:02:20.583 --> 01:02:22.020
Nelly Bondy: And I maintained it myself.

01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:22.238
David Boder: Ja...

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:26.472
Nelly Bondy: During the day I burned wood and during the night I had some...ah...coal. Very few.

01:02:26.472 --> 01:02:26.741
David Boder: Ja...

01:02:26.741 --> 01:02:32.477
Nelly Bondy: Very...little. I just kept it for the night in order not to be able...be obliged to start in fresh in the morning.

01:02:32.477 --> 01:02:34.112
David Boder: Ja...well?

01:02:34.112 --> 01:02:51.868
Nelly Bondy: I remained there for a fortnight [?] and then finally I couldn’t stand it and I went to see the mayor of this place and asked him for a certificate that I was ill and that I needed a doctor. I [he] said, “I would...I would give it to you but it’s of no use. I’ve given it to several people and the Americans didn’t consider it.” As I tried then to leave...

01:02:51.868 --> 01:02:54.954
David Boder: . . . and on that side was what, Germany or [unintelligible]?

01:02:54.954 --> 01:03:00.991
Nelly Bondy: No, that was non-occupied. You see, the Americans had occupied the town to this river. There was a river there.

01:03:00.991 --> 01:03:02.641
David Boder: It was a kind of a no man’s land?

01:03:02.641 --> 01:03:04.057
Nelly Bondy: Yes, kind of a no man’s land without a...

01:03:04.057 --> 01:03:05.529
David Boder: And the mayor was a German?

01:03:05.529 --> 01:03:06.869
Nelly Bondy: Yes, it was a German mayor.

01:03:06.869 --> 01:03:07.560
David Boder: Ja...

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:09.596
Nelly Bondy: And we awaited the approach of the Russians.

01:03:09.596 --> 01:03:09.672
David Boder: Ja...

01:03:09.672 --> 01:03:11.662
Nelly Bondy: The Americans were on the other side of the bridge.

01:03:11.662 --> 01:03:14.378
David Boder: Ja...

01:03:14.378 --> 01:03:43.409
Nelly Bondy: He gave me the certificate stating that I was a French political prisoner and I went to see the guard on the bridge with that; and he said, “That’s all right, but you need the approval of an American officer.” I said, “Well, let me get over. I’ll get it.” “Oh, you can’t get over.” So I didn’t know what to do, and I asked him if he couldn’t...ah...ask the officer if it...if I couldn’t [get] over with this, and he was...ah...a bit drunk, this boy.

01:03:43.409 --> 01:03:44.023
David Boder: A bit what?

01:03:44.023 --> 01:03:44.693
Nelly Bondy: Drunk. [she speaks in whisper]

01:03:44.693 --> 01:03:45.993
David Boder: Yes...

01:03:45.993 --> 01:03:46.668
Nelly Bondy: And...ah...

01:03:46.668 --> 01:03:47.338
David Boder: The American?

01:03:47.338 --> 01:03:49.850
Nelly Bondy: American, but he was very young [?]; he was quite a boy.

01:03:49.850 --> 01:03:50.124
David Boder: Ja...

01:03:50.124 --> 01:04:21.607
Nelly Bondy: He was quite young. He might have been twenty-two or so, and the he said, “I’ll...ah...I’ll ask the officer for you and come back tomorrow. I’ll be on duty and I’ll tell you what he...what he says.” So I said to him, “Oh, thank you. That’s very kind of you.” He said, “Well, I know,” and with that I went back. But I had heard about a German nurse who could pass over to the American occupied zone. I went to see her and I asked if she couldn’t help [me] to an authorization from the American officers [unintelligible].

01:04:21.607 --> 01:04:24.795
David Boder: What group was that? Is the...was the war over?

01:04:24.795 --> 01:04:28.018
Nelly Bondy: No, officially not. It was the end of April.

01:04:28.018 --> 01:04:30.303
David Boder: Ja...well?

01:04:30.303 --> 01:04:52.761
Nelly Bondy: And...ah...well, the Germans knew that everything was lost anyway; so they didn’t care, more or less. Well, I went to town to find this nurse, and the first thing she did was to...to bandage my foot again; and she saw that I really needed a doctor. So she took the paper and...ah...she went over. She crossed the bridge and she had the...she obtained authorization.

01:04:52.761 --> 01:04:53.243
David Boder: To bring you over?

01:04:53.243 --> 01:05:02.460
Nelly Bondy: To bring my...to bring me over. Well, the next day she came to fetch me and just the morning of this day—it was in the afternoon when she came to fetch me—but in the morning the Russians had arrived there.

01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:03.196
David Boder: Ja...

01:05:03.196 --> 01:05:05.145
Nelly Bondy: And now there was a Russian guard...Russian...

01:05:05.145 --> 01:05:05.602
David Boder: Guard on this side?

01:05:05.602 --> 01:05:17.021
Nelly Bondy: . . . guard on this side of the bridge. He told me that I needed a Russian authorization. I was...and I said...ah...I didn’t take...pay any heed to him. I said I was ordered, was sick and I had an American authorization [?].

01:05:17.021 --> 01:05:18.590
David Boder: What language did he talk?

01:05:18.590 --> 01:05:21.306
Nelly Bondy: Russian. Well, he...I made myself understood, the French.

01:05:21.306 --> 01:05:23.951
David Boder: Ja...

01:05:23.951 --> 01:05:39.733
Nelly Bondy: Well, I got over and they put me off to a hospital there immediately; and three or four days there was a French prisoner who was making lists for French people and...ah...she took my name down and a few days later I was sent to Leipzig and...sent back to France.

01:05:39.733 --> 01:05:46.978
David Boder: Ja...tell me about your husband.

01:05:46.978 --> 01:05:56.116
Nelly Bondy: My husband was a Czech subject. He had been...he had engaged himself as a volunteer at the beginning of the war. One we—...one week after the...

01:05:56.116 --> 01:05:57.959
David Boder: Did you marry him [in] Vienna?

01:05:57.959 --> 01:06:04.462
Nelly Bondy: Well, yes. He was living in Paris since ’26, but he came to Vienna for the...for the marriage—just for the wedding ceremony.

01:06:04.462 --> 01:06:05.005
David Boder: Ja...

01:06:05.005 --> 01:06:05.553
Nelly Bondy: Then we left Vienna.

01:06:05.553 --> 01:06:07.188
David Boder: You knew him before?

01:06:07.188 --> 01:06:11.985
Nelly Bondy: Yes. I had known him when I had been in Paris previously in ’35.

01:06:11.985 --> 01:06:14.427
David Boder: Yes...

01:06:14.427 --> 01:06:30.966
Nelly Bondy: We...when he had been...he had to be called to the colors in...ah...January ’40; and he had been discharged from the army in September ’40. Then we went back to Paris.

01:06:30.966 --> 01:06:32.555
David Boder: Why was he discharged?

01:06:32.555 --> 01:06:33.159
Nelly Bondy: Well, the war was over.

01:06:33.159 --> 01:06:34.124
David Boder: The armistice? The...

01:06:34.124 --> 01:06:34.992
Nelly Bondy: Yes. The armistice.

01:06:34.992 --> 01:06:35.956
David Boder: Ja...this arranged armistice.

01:06:35.956 --> 01:06:37.347
Nelly Bondy: Yes, that’s right.

01:06:37.347 --> 01:06:38.911
David Boder: Yes...

01:06:38.911 --> 01:06:46.249
Nelly Bondy: In...ah...April, ’41, our third child was born and four weeks later he was...

01:06:46.249 --> 01:06:47.427
David Boder: Which child was born, the fourth one?

01:06:47.427 --> 01:06:48.965
Nelly Bondy: Our youngest child. He was...

01:06:48.965 --> 01:06:49.625
David Boder: That’s the third or the fourth?

01:06:49.625 --> 01:06:51.275
Nelly Bondy: Third. Yes, we had a little boy.

01:06:51.275 --> 01:06:52.562
David Boder: Ja...

01:06:52.562 --> 01:07:27.016
Nelly Bondy: Four weeks later he was arrested and he never returned to Paris. He had...he was kept in a camp near Orleans which was before [?]; and he was sent...ah...depor—...he was deported to an unknown destination thirteen months later. That was in June of ’42. I never had any news from him, but when I came to Auschwitz myself—I was working in the so-called Politische Abteilung, that was the administration of the camp, and I found his file card and I found that [he] had been...[pause]

01:07:27.016 --> 01:07:29.813
David Boder: When you were at Auschwitz, you say?

01:07:29.813 --> 01:07:44.853
Nelly Bondy: Yes. When I was in Auschwitz I worked in the so-called Politsche Abteilung, that was part of the administration of the camp, I found out by his file card that he had been, three months after his arrival, killed by a guard, in ’42.

01:07:44.853 --> 01:07:46.336
David Boder: Did they say why or what, or...?

01:07:46.336 --> 01:07:49.823
Nelly Bondy: Nothing.

01:07:49.823 --> 01:07:54.775
David Boder: Eh...now tell me. You were in Auschwitz in the office?

01:07:54.775 --> 01:07:55.521
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

01:07:55.521 --> 01:08:00.628
David Boder: Did you know then at all these gassing and...ah...so on procedures?

01:08:00.628 --> 01:08:00.897
Nelly Bondy: Yes, I did.

01:08:00.897 --> 01:08:02.897
David Boder: What did you know about it?

01:08:02.897 --> 01:08:05.851
Nelly Bondy: Well, officially everything was kept secret.

01:08:05.851 --> 01:08:06.029
David Boder: Yes.

01:08:06.029 --> 01:08:12.293
Nelly Bondy: But of course, we knew because...ah...before selections were made we got the lists.

01:08:12.293 --> 01:08:13.090
David Boder: Ja...

01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:20.537
Nelly Bondy: And we made out the lists. We were taking out a file card on everybody and marking his death even before he was dead.

01:08:20.537 --> 01:08:25.547
David Boder: Oh, that...ah...and what did they call it officially there?

01:08:25.547 --> 01:08:26.227
Nelly Bondy: Pardon?

01:08:26.227 --> 01:08:35.971
David Boder: What did the Germans call such a procedure? So what will they...they would say to make out a list and take out a card. Wofur? Wozu?

01:08:35.971 --> 01:08:39.631
Nelly Bondy: Well, we never were...ah...su—...supposed to ask any questions. They told us...

01:08:39.631 --> 01:08:39.727
David Boder: Yes...

01:08:39.727 --> 01:08:43.595
Nelly Bondy: . . . do that and do that and we had to do it. Everybody knew why, but...ah...they weren’t given any reason.

01:08:43.595 --> 01:08:47.820
David Boder: And what would you...so when you found your husband’s card what did it say?

01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:49.465
Nelly Bondy: Well, he was already dead.

01:08:49.465 --> 01:08:50.993
David Boder: What did it say?

01:08:50.993 --> 01:08:54.450
Nelly Bondy: It was said that he had died on that and that date.

01:08:54.450 --> 01:08:54.851
David Boder: Hm...

01:08:54.851 --> 01:08:59.034
Nelly Bondy: But...as we knew that there was a big selection on this day...

01:08:59.034 --> 01:08:59.425
David Boder: Yes...

01:08:59.425 --> 01:09:00.841
Nelly Bondy: . . . so we...we knew about that.

01:09:00.841 --> 01:09:01.613
David Boder: Um-hum...

01:09:01.613 --> 01:09:04.918
Nelly Bondy: By the by, they burned all these cards...ah...you see.

01:09:04.918 --> 01:09:05.573
David Boder: Ja...

01:09:05.573 --> 01:09:16.756
Nelly Bondy: They...they burned the cards when...after a certain fire. My husband’s file card was still there in...ah...in July ’43; but it was no more there in October ’43.

01:09:16.756 --> 01:09:17.665
David Boder: They would pick out the cards and...

01:09:17.665 --> 01:09:23.416
Nelly Bondy: They would take out the cards by and by and burn them...officially they were sent to Birkenau, but...

01:09:23.416 --> 01:09:23.863
David Boder: Ja...

01:09:23.863 --> 01:09:25.492
Nelly Bondy: . . . they were burned.

01:09:25.492 --> 01:09:29.523
David Boder: Were you somewhere near those crematories in Auschwitz?

01:09:29.523 --> 01:09:38.838
Nelly Bondy: Well, we had one quite near our office; but it didn’t work anymore when I came there. It had been working there before, and it...ah...the chimney was taken away during my time.

01:09:38.838 --> 01:09:40.646
David Boder: Why?

01:09:40.646 --> 01:09:45.412
Nelly Bondy: I don’t know exactly, but I suppose they wanted to leave as few traces as possible.

01:09:45.412 --> 01:09:47.321
David Boder: Aha...

01:09:47.321 --> 01:10:05.107
Nelly Bondy: The...these killings by gas were supposed to stop altogether since...ah...October or November ’44. I couldn’t tell you exactly if they really did, but...ah...lots of these chimneys were taken away at that time, even the chimneys in Birkenau.

01:10:05.107 --> 01:10:20.920
David Boder: Tell me, there is one thing that is so...ah...ah...cloudy and maybe you worked...having worked in an office you know...eh. What do they say about the Gypsies—the Zigeuner?

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:29.911
Nelly Bondy: Well, the Gypsies...ah...were considered the...the worst...ah...inhabitants after the Jews.

01:10:29.911 --> 01:10:30.231
David Boder: Ja...

01:10:30.231 --> 01:10:33.891
Nelly Bondy: You see, there were certain...certain...hierarchive [hierarchy].

01:10:33.891 --> 01:10:35.490
David Boder: Yes. Gra—...gradua—...gradation.

01:10:35.490 --> 01:10:40.520
Nelly Bondy: “Graduation.” Yes. Well, the lowest...the lowest case were the Jews. Then came the Gypsies.

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:40.987
David Boder: Ja...

01:10:40.987 --> 01:10:52.417
Nelly Bondy: Then came the...the Poles or so...well, all people who were not German. Then came the so-called antisocial or asocial German inmates.

01:10:52.417 --> 01:10:53.097
David Boder: Ja...

01:10:53.097 --> 01:10:54.719
Nelly Bondy: And the political prisoners.

01:10:54.719 --> 01:10:57.060
David Boder: Yes. Well, so what about the Gypsies?

01:10:57.060 --> 01:11:07.572
Nelly Bondy: Well, the Gypsies were not treated much better than the Jews. There was a so-called...ah...family camp for Gypsies; but the Gypsies were killed by gas...ah...exactly as Jews.

01:11:07.572 --> 01:11:11.136
David Boder: Eh...they permitted the Gypsies to live together—the men and the women?

01:11:11.136 --> 01:11:27.600
Nelly Bondy: Yes. Men and women and children lived together in one big camp in Birkenau. But the camp dissolved and they sent away the part of young men and young Gypsies to other camps for...I suppose they’d se—...they sent them to work in a...in a war factories.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:28.067
David Boder: Yes.

01:11:28.067 --> 01:11:30.287
Nelly Bondy: Ammunition factories or so.

01:11:30.287 --> 01:11:31.049
David Boder: Yes.

01:11:31.049 --> 01:11:32.699
Nelly Bondy: And the others were killed.

01:11:32.699 --> 01:11:33.719
David Boder: The others were killed...

01:11:33.719 --> 01:11:34.440
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:36.562
David Boder: There was no Zigeunerlager in...ah...Auschwitz?

01:11:36.562 --> 01:11:37.846
Nelly Bondy: Yes, a Zigeunerlager.

01:11:37.846 --> 01:11:38.973
David Boder: There was in Auschwitz a Zigeunerlager?

01:11:38.973 --> 01:11:40.598
Nelly Bondy: In...ah...in Birkenau.

01:11:40.598 --> 01:11:41.375
David Boder: In Birkenau there was a Zigeunerlager?

01:11:41.375 --> 01:11:43.086
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

01:11:43.086 --> 01:11:46.330
David Boder: So that’s what you know about them. Where did they get all those Gy—...Gypsies?

01:11:46.330 --> 01:11:50.284
Nelly Bondy: Well, they picked them up exactly as they captured Jews...the Jews.

01:11:50.284 --> 01:11:53.777
David Boder: And were there that many? Well, did they get them from Austria, from...

01:11:53.777 --> 01:11:59.274
Nelly Bondy: From Austria, yes. From Germany. From all over the...the...the German-occupied Europe.

01:11:59.274 --> 01:11:59.356
David Boder: Ja...

01:11:59.356 --> 01:12:04.661
Nelly Bondy: There were Romanian and Italian and Hungarian and Slovakian and all kinds of nationalities.

01:12:04.661 --> 01:12:07.478
David Boder: Hm...how old are your children now, Miss...Mrs. Bondy?

01:12:07.478 --> 01:12:11.042
Nelly Bondy: Well, I have a daughter who’s nine, and two boys, of seven and five years.

01:12:11.042 --> 01:12:12.621
David Boder: And where are they now?

01:12:12.621 --> 01:12:17.519
Nelly Bondy: They are in the center of France...ah...where they have stayed ever since I was deported.

01:12:17.519 --> 01:12:20.489
David Boder: Aha...eh...do you go visit them, or what?

01:12:20.489 --> 01:12:31.470
Nelly Bondy: I go to see them sometime, but it’s rather far from Paris. I...I wish to take them back to Paris but till this day I didn’t...get my flat back. We had a big flat before...

01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:32.044
David Boder: Yes...

01:12:32.044 --> 01:12:36.049
Nelly Bondy: And...ah...it’s occupied now and I couldn’t get it back.

01:12:36.049 --> 01:12:36.232
David Boder: How...

01:12:36.232 --> 01:12:39.750
Nelly Bondy: I have been back for more than a year and I...I can’t get in.

01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:42.141
David Boder: Tell me, why...who lives there?

01:12:42.141 --> 01:12:46.613
Nelly Bondy: There is a man who was once a prisoner in Germany.

01:12:46.613 --> 01:12:46.816
David Boder: Yes...

01:12:46.816 --> 01:12:51.608
Nelly Bondy: He came back in ’42 and fought the Free [?] and he has a military requisition.

01:12:51.608 --> 01:12:52.258
David Boder: Ah...

01:12:52.258 --> 01:12:58.446
Nelly Bondy: And...ah...even though this requisition have...ah...no more sense now the war being over...

01:12:58.446 --> 01:12:59.608
David Boder: No more value.

01:12:59.608 --> 01:13:01.619
Nelly Bondy: Yes. I can’t get him out.

01:13:01.619 --> 01:13:04.467
David Boder: And...eh...that is why you can’t bring your children over?

01:13:04.467 --> 01:13:21.533
Nelly Bondy: That’s why I can’t bring my children back with me to Paris; and they need it very badly because they’re in a...quite a small place where there is no good school. My daughter is nine years [?]. She ought to speak a second language by now...by now; and...ah...no kind of education and nothing at all. I’m very worried about her.

01:13:21.533 --> 01:13:27.792
David Boder: Eh...tell me...ah...you are here with the...with the Joint Distribution Committee?

01:13:27.792 --> 01:13:28.193
Nelly Bondy: Yes, I work with...

01:13:28.193 --> 01:13:32.163
David Boder: How did you find them; to work for them?

01:13:32.163 --> 01:13:46.244
Nelly Bondy: I knew a lady who was working for the Joint and I had met her once in...in these critical days in ’42 when we...everybody was trembling to be arrested. She just came to see me. She was a friend of my governess.

01:13:46.244 --> 01:13:47.001
David Boder: Hm...

01:13:47.001 --> 01:13:52.985
Nelly Bondy: And she was working here, and when I came back to my governess I got in touch with her, and she...eh...she got me here.

01:13:52.985 --> 01:13:54.772
David Boder: Your governess was never deported?

01:13:54.772 --> 01:13:56.691
Nelly Bondy: No, she slipped through.

01:13:56.691 --> 01:13:57.437
David Boder: She lived through.

01:13:57.437 --> 01:14:05.129
Nelly Bondy: But was very...she was awfully kind as well as [?]...it was very lucky for me because she took care of the children, really as if they had been hers.

01:14:05.129 --> 01:14:17.013
David Boder: Yes. Tell me, Mrs. Bondy, you were...since you were near the...ah...Nazi now and then in the office, what were they talking? Did they believe they will win the war and all that?

01:14:17.013 --> 01:14:30.463
Nelly Bondy: I don’t think they did. Finally they did not. They were supposed to make us believe that they would win the war, and I remember after the...the Americans had come to Paris that...ah...

01:14:30.463 --> 01:14:31.002
David Boder: Ja...

01:14:31.002 --> 01:14:44.723
Nelly Bondy: . . . they told us that the Germans had...ah...had...ah...blown up half of the city. And he even told me the different quarters which had been blown up. He talk—...he talked about the Republique...the Quarter of the Republique, the Quarter of the Opera.

01:14:44.723 --> 01:14:46.170
David Boder: Where did they talk about it, in Auschwitz?

01:14:46.170 --> 01:14:50.876
Nelly Bondy: In Auschwitz. He told me that all these quarters in Paris had been blown up by the Germans before they left.

01:14:50.876 --> 01:14:51.368
David Boder: Aha...

01:14:51.368 --> 01:14:51.450
Nelly Bondy: So we...

01:14:51.450 --> 01:14:53.597
David Boder: So in Auschwitz they knew already that the Germans had left Paris?

01:14:53.597 --> 01:14:56.744
Nelly Bondy: Yes. It was in...in August or September, ’44.

01:14:56.744 --> 01:14:59.499
David Boder: And that they were talking freely; so you knew what was going on.

01:14:59.499 --> 01:15:07.121
Nelly Bondy: Well, we knew. You see, we...we knew what was going on. Some of the girls were working with high officers who had broadcastings in their rooms so sometime they manage to hear.

01:15:07.121 --> 01:15:09.106
David Boder: [simultaneously] Eh...to...radio sets in there?

01:15:09.106 --> 01:15:09.852
Nelly Bondy: Yes.

01:15:09.852 --> 01:15:11.162
David Boder: Ja...some of them managed to hear it.

01:15:11.162 --> 01:15:15.015
Nelly Bondy: Managed to hear. Yes. They were never supposed to listen because it was...ah...

01:15:15.015 --> 01:15:15.639
David Boder: Ja...

01:15:15.639 --> 01:15:15.913
Nelly Bondy: . . . prohibited.

01:15:15.913 --> 01:15:17.142
David Boder: High treason?

01:15:17.142 --> 01:15:20.162
Nelly Bondy: Yes. Everything was verboten.

01:15:20.162 --> 01:15:29.457
David Boder: Tell me, in general...did the women fare who had to work with the Nazis? How did they behave...behave towards women?

01:15:29.457 --> 01:15:51.864
Nelly Bondy: Well, they didn’t behave very well, I’m sorry to say. That’s to say, they made an exception for us who were working with them. They behaved fairly well. Of course, if they had an occasion they got drunk even if we were there or not. That was a different kind of thing; but on a general scale they treated us...ah...like machines, like automatons, you see.

01:15:51.864 --> 01:15:52.189
David Boder: Ja...

01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:53.144
Nelly Bondy: “Do this and do that,” and...

01:15:53.144 --> 01:15:55.403
David Boder: What did they call you?

01:15:55.403 --> 01:15:55.672
Nelly Bondy: They called us with our names.

01:15:55.672 --> 01:15:56.738
David Boder: Did they call you “Clara” [?] ?

01:15:56.738 --> 01:15:58.880
Nelly Bondy: No, they called me “Bondy.”

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:01.895
David Boder: Bondy. By the...by the last name.

01:16:01.895 --> 01:16:04.137
Nelly Bondy: Yes. Some of the girls they called by their first names.

01:16:04.137 --> 01:16:09.934
David Boder: Aha...well, Mrs. Bondy, it was awfully good of you.

01:16:09.934 --> 01:16:10.183
Nelly Bondy: Well, I...

01:16:10.183 --> 01:16:16.858
David Boder: I think it was worthwhile to trouble here with electricity. I will have a bill for a broken lamp.

01:16:16.858 --> 01:16:17.273
Nelly Bondy: Oh, I’m sorry!

01:16:17.273 --> 01:16:24.183
David Boder: But that was...[laughing] well, that’s all right. We will charge it to research; and it was awfully good of you. I’m glad I have met you.

01:16:24.183 --> 01:16:25.249
Nelly Bondy: Oh, that’s OK.

01:16:25.249 --> 01:16:28.204
David Boder: Thank you very much. See that you get me somebody else.

01:16:28.204 --> 01:16:31.021
Nelly Bondy: That’s all right [unintelligible]. Somebody else? From Auschwitz I haven’t got [unintelligible, away from microphone]...

01:16:31.021 --> 01:16:33.366
David Boder: Well, Auschwitz or some other place.

01:16:33.366 --> 01:16:35.143
Nelly Bondy: All right [?] [far from microphone].

01:16:35.143 --> 01:16:49.332
David Boder: Eh, this concludes...Spool...61...taken at the...headquarters of the Joint Distribution Committee on August 22nd, 1946, in Paris. A Illinois Institute of Technology wire recording.
