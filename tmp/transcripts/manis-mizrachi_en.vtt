00:00:00.782 --> 00:00:43.085
David Boder: [In English] This is Spool 9-43B. The interviewee is Mr. Mizrachi and he speaks English. November the 21st 1950. Boder.

00:00:43.085 --> 00:00:59.025
David Boder: This is Spool 43 continued. The interviewee is Señor Manis Mizrachi or Mr. Manis Mizrachi. Born in Greece, how old are you Mr. Mizrachi?

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:00.508
Manis Mizrachi: I am twenty-four years old.

00:01:00.508 --> 00:01:13.516
David Boder: He’s twenty-four years old. He speaks good English and we will have his report in English. Also Mr. Mizrachi would you tell us again what is your full name where were you born?

00:01:13.516 --> 00:01:19.573
Manis Mizrachi: My name is Mizrachi Mimi I have been born in Salonika.Salonika, the largest city in northern Greece, is also known as Thessalonika. It was second to Athens in population and as a seaport to Piraeus. Salonikia had a culturally  and religiously vibrant Sephardic Jewish community. It was the heart of the Sephardic world.1

00:01:19.573 --> 00:01:22.350
David Boder: Yes. Your last name is really Mizrachi so we...

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.840
Manis Mizrachi: . . . Mizrachi, yes.Mizrachi is derived from the Hebrew word, “mizrach”, which means east.2

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.286
David Boder: . . . call you in America “Minis Mizrachi.”Mr. Mizrachi at first inverted his first and last names. Boder then corrected him but used “Minis” instead of “Manis.”3

00:01:25.286 --> 00:01:25.867
Manis Mizrachi: . . . Mizrachi, yes

00:01:25.867 --> 00:01:27.982
David Boder: You were born where?

00:01:27.982 --> 00:01:32.474
Manis Mizrachi: In Salonika, 1922.

00:01:32.474 --> 00:01:34.168
David Boder: In 1922, yes.

00:01:34.168 --> 00:01:35.802
Manis Mizrachi: The 17th of January.

00:01:35.802 --> 00:01:41.528
David Boder: Yeah, and tell me, who were your parents and what was their business.

00:01:41.528 --> 00:01:57.233
Manis Mizrachi: My parents - my father was Oscar Mizrachi and he was...he sold articles which he brought from every country and he was a representative of several firms.

00:01:57.233 --> 00:01:59.198
David Boder: Ah! He was an importer?

00:01:59.198 --> 00:01:59.989
Manis Mizrachi: importer yes.

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:03.398
David Boder: Yes, for instance what kind of articles was he selling?

00:02:03.398 --> 00:02:11.858
Manis Mizrachi: He was selling clothing and paper, he brought paper and several other things what he could make.

00:02:11.858 --> 00:02:14.665
David Boder: Now tell me how many people were in your family?

00:02:14.665 --> 00:02:16.118
Manis Mizrachi: We’re three people.

00:02:16.118 --> 00:02:16.849
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.332
Manis Mizrachi: My father, mother and me.

00:02:18.332 --> 00:02:19.545
David Boder: You were the only son?

00:02:19.545 --> 00:02:20.517
Manis Mizrachi: The only son.

00:02:20.517 --> 00:02:29.162
David Boder: Yes, and now tell me where were you and what happened to your family when the Germans came to Greece?

00:02:29.162 --> 00:02:51.008
Manis Mizrachi: Before the Germans came to Greece since my father was a Freemason,The Freemasons were a secretive, liberal, humanitarian fraternal order. The Nazis persecuted the Freemasons in the belief that Masonic lodges were used by Jews in their quest for world domination and as such were a part of the Jewish world conspiracy.4 we...were afraid for the Germans, them not to take him away from us. That for we made it up to go to Athens, the capital of Greece, since it is a very big country so we could...

00:02:51.008 --> 00:02:53.003
David Boder: [speaking over each other] Big city you mean...

00:02:53.003 --> 00:02:53.554
Manis Mizrachi: Big city, yes,

00:02:53.554 --> 00:02:55.459
David Boder: So you could be better protected...

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:56.220
Manis Mizrachi: Better protected.Some Jews from Salonika did flee to Athens which came under Italian control after the German conquest of Greece on June 2, 1941. The Italians treated the Jews humanely.5

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.351
David Boder: Tell me what citizenship did your father have? Greece or Spanish?

00:03:00.351 --> 00:03:02.045
Manis Mizrachi: My father was Spanish

00:03:02.045 --> 00:03:02.866
David Boder: And your mother?

00:03:02.866 --> 00:03:05.282
Manis Mizrachi: My mother was Turkish.

00:03:05.282 --> 00:03:07.518
David Boder: Turkish? And you were considered what?

00:03:07.518 --> 00:03:10.476
Manis Mizrachi: I have been considered Spanish.

00:03:10.476 --> 00:03:14.577
David Boder: Because your father was Spanish. Have you lived in Spain?

00:03:14.577 --> 00:03:16.632
Manis Mizrachi: Never, I have never in Spain.

00:03:16.632 --> 00:03:19.780
David Boder: Yes, all right, and so you went to Athens

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:51.002
Manis Mizrachi: And so we went to Athens but anyhow the Germans took us because although the Consul of Spain has certifies us that we have no reason to be afraid that the Germans will take us and but for this obliged us not to leave and not to hide ourselves and so the Germans came one night at two o’clock and got us [the whole family, they beat us firstly] and afterwards they put us into the Greek jail.Mr. Mizrachi’s family spent some eighteen months of relative peace and quiet in Athens before the German occupation of that city in September 1943. Subsequently, Dieter Wisliceny, Adolph Eichmann’s deputy, arrived in Athens with detailed plans for the destruction of the Jewish community of that city.6

00:03:51.002 --> 00:04:04.271
David Boder: All right, now...Tell me this...[mutters] All right, tell me this: Were other Jews then arrested already and deported?

00:04:04.271 --> 00:04:11.592
Manis Mizrachi: A lot of Jews, Spanish Jews, were arrested and [spread?] with our family together.

00:04:11.592 --> 00:04:16.175
David Boder: Yes, and what was it a kind of a raid at that time or what?

00:04:16.175 --> 00:04:29.122
Manis Mizrachi: It was a raid, it was a raid for whole Spanish in order not to leave them the time to hide themselves because one day before they arrested all Greek citizens, Jews of course.Although the German raids were to prevent Jews going into hiding, many Athenian Jews did manage to hide with their Greek Christian neighbors despite the German penalty of death  for Greeks providing shelter. The Greek Orthodox Church and the Greek underground helped to hide a number of Jews.7

00:04:29.122 --> 00:04:39.264
David Boder: They arrested the Greeks citizens that were Jews. And now they began to arrest the Spanish citizens...well didn’t you show your papers from the Consul?

00:04:39.264 --> 00:04:43.817
Manis Mizrachi: We showed our papers from the Consul but it [laughing a little] helped nothing.

00:04:43.817 --> 00:04:47.978
David Boder: All right, so then what did they do with the family, go slowly step-by-step.

00:04:47.978 --> 00:05:04.889
Manis Mizrachi: Then they put us in cars and brought us in the Greek jail where we were obliged to sleep down without any help...they give us no things to eat, nothing. We’re made whole day without any thing...

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.914
David Boder: [interrupting] Was the family together?

00:05:06.914 --> 00:05:34.165
Manis Mizrachi: The family was together firstly; afterwards, they ordered us the men to go separately and the women from the other side. So we remained there in the jail about fifteen days and the first of April we were obliged to leave the jail and they put us into trains...of beasts.The German roundup of the Jews of Athens began in March 1944.8

00:05:34.165 --> 00:05:37.364
David Boder: Why do you call it “trains of beasts?” They were...

00:05:37.364 --> 00:05:44.595
Manis Mizrachi: Because they were closed trains were they are putting the [laughing a little]...horses and...the pigs

00:05:44.595 --> 00:05:49.328
David Boder: . . . the trains with the openings? Because animals they transport...

00:05:49.328 --> 00:05:53.911
Manis Mizrachi: No, they were closed but they were with wires.

00:05:53.911 --> 00:05:55.665
David Boder: [Talking over each other] Where were the wires?

00:05:55.665 --> 00:06:15.754
Manis Mizrachi: The wires were at the windows. Little window was there, very high, although they were afraid us not to look from what happened around and so they put us there and they locked us, the door so we couldn’t get out for any necessary...

00:06:15.754 --> 00:06:17.960
David Boder: For any necessary? Were you men and women together...

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:28.796
Manis Mizrachi: We were men and women together. Sixty-four people in a wagon, it was very difficult to take air and to eat, we had nothing to eat.

00:06:28.796 --> 00:06:31.182
David Boder: Didn’t they tell you to take your things?

00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:40.850
Manis Mizrachi: No, they didn’t give - they gave us only some carrots and bottle of water and place...

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.296
David Boder: What do you mean a bottle of water for all or what?

00:06:43.296 --> 00:06:46.916
Manis Mizrachi: It was...two big bottles

00:06:46.916 --> 00:06:47.828
David Boder: Two big bottles of water.

00:06:47.828 --> 00:06:48.318
Manis Mizrachi: . . . bottles of water.

00:06:48.318 --> 00:06:52.179
David Boder: What do you think? How many liters was there in each one?

00:06:52.179 --> 00:06:54.505
Manis Mizrachi: Twenty-five liters about.

00:06:54.505 --> 00:06:57.072
David Boder: You mean twenty-five liters to the bottle?

00:06:57.072 --> 00:07:07.974
Manis Mizrachi: Yes, and it was very hard we couldn’t have water enough because we had children with us and we couldn’t wash ourselves we were very dirty...

00:07:07.974 --> 00:07:08.344
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:08.344 --> 00:07:10.369
Manis Mizrachi: . . . and after the tenth day of traveling

00:07:10.369 --> 00:07:13.447
David Boder: [astonished]...wait you mean you were ten days, ten days in the car?

00:07:13.447 --> 00:07:29.717
Manis Mizrachi: In all we were fourteen days but after the tenth day they opened - they got out the wires so we could look outwards but we were without shaving ourselves and were like beasts.

00:07:29.717 --> 00:07:33.668
David Boder: Now tell me what kind of toilet facilities did you have?

00:07:33.668 --> 00:07:44.630
Manis Mizrachi: No one. Every two days they opened us the doors in order to get out things that...we couldn’t keep anymore in our leavings[?]

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.234
David Boder: Did you have a pocket for it?

00:07:46.234 --> 00:07:50.817
Manis Mizrachi: No, it was in a piece of papers what they gave us specially for that.This exchange between Boder and Mr. Mizrachi is not entirely clear. Perhaps “pocket” meant “bucket” for waste which was then placed in the “piece of paper” and thrown out of the train every two days.9

00:07:50.817 --> 00:07:53.624
David Boder: And women and men together in this...

00:07:53.624 --> 00:07:55.198
Manis Mizrachi: Women and men together...

00:07:55.198 --> 00:07:55.448
David Boder: . . . and children

00:07:55.448 --> 00:07:57.383
Manis Mizrachi: . . . it was awful

00:07:57.383 --> 00:07:58.295
David Boder: And so?

00:07:58.295 --> 00:08:20.658
Manis Mizrachi: And so, until we arrived at six in the morning—six o’clock in the morning and the town of Celle which is some kilometers far from the camp, real camp of Bergen-Belsen. And so we went there, we were obliged to go—to step seven or eight kilometers.Bergen Belsen concentration camp was named for the nearby town of Bergen. It was established in July 1943 and was originally intended for Jews whom the German government wished to exchange for Germans in Allied territory.10

00:08:20.658 --> 00:08:21.600
David Boder: To walk?

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:43.883
Manis Mizrachi: To walk there with our grandfathers, with our fathers, sisters, sick women, with our children and however it was very difficult for us and this one who couldn’t walk he was beaten by the Germans, soldiers, by the capos...were the leaders.

00:08:43.883 --> 00:08:45.487
David Boder: What is capos?

00:08:45.487 --> 00:08:46.579
Manis Mizrachi: Capos were the leaders.

00:08:46.579 --> 00:08:48.484
David Boder: Were they prisoners?

00:08:48.484 --> 00:09:05.187
Manis Mizrachi: They were prisoners but who...somewhere...collaborated with the Germans together. And they beat us awfully we were not accustomed to this kind of manner and they were laughing at us when we made strange figures.

00:09:05.187 --> 00:09:06.339
David Boder: Strange faces you mean?

00:09:06.339 --> 00:09:07.853
Manis Mizrachi: Strange faces, yes.

00:09:07.853 --> 00:09:12.315
David Boder: And well, and so how long did it last to walk these eight kilometers?

00:09:12.315 --> 00:09:17.379
Manis Mizrachi: This eight kilometers took us about...one hour and a half.

00:09:17.379 --> 00:09:20.066
David Boder: [after a pause] That’s very fast walking.

00:09:20.066 --> 00:09:23.626
Manis Mizrachi: Yes! We were obliged to run.

00:09:23.626 --> 00:09:26.163
David Boder: Well you had no things to carry

00:09:26.163 --> 00:09:27.195
Manis Mizrachi: No things to carry, nothing.

00:09:27.195 --> 00:09:28.137
David Boder: Well then...

00:09:28.137 --> 00:09:39.550
Manis Mizrachi: Because we had some things we could keep with us but we were obliged to leave it in the way in order to go very fast because it was a Polish capo behind and he was beating you.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:40.492
David Boder: A Polish capo?

00:09:40.492 --> 00:09:41.344
Manis Mizrachi: A Polish, yes.Later on in the interview, Mr. Mizrachi identified the capos as Polish Jews.11

00:09:41.344 --> 00:09:44.783
David Boder: All right, but you were together with your father and mother?

00:09:44.783 --> 00:09:48.764
Manis Mizrachi: No I wasn’t even with my father, and my mother had been put in another range [?].

00:09:48.764 --> 00:09:51.511
David Boder: Oh, your mother was put in another what?

00:09:51.511 --> 00:09:52.724
Manis Mizrachi: In other file.

00:09:52.724 --> 00:09:58.450
David Boder: In another file, all right. But she was marching the same way with you?

00:09:58.450 --> 00:09:59.663
Manis Mizrachi: Yes, much in the same way.

00:09:59.663 --> 00:10:01.929
David Boder: All right.

00:10:01.929 --> 00:10:06.482
Manis Mizrachi: Afterwards we went to the camp they...were obliged to stay there for l’appel.

00:10:06.482 --> 00:10:08.056
David Boder: What is the name of the camp?

00:10:08.056 --> 00:10:09.359
Manis Mizrachi: The camp Bergen-Belsen.

00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:09.789
David Boder: Yes

00:10:09.789 --> 00:10:16.448
Manis Mizrachi: We were obliged to stay there about two hours waiting until the German come and ask our names...

00:10:16.448 --> 00:10:17.360
David Boder: Yes...

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:24.350
Manis Mizrachi: . . . conforming to the list that he could have in Athens when he put us into the train

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:25.412
David Boder: Do you have a tattoo number?

00:10:25.412 --> 00:10:28.581
Manis Mizrachi: No, in Bergen-Belsen there was no tattoo number.

00:10:28.581 --> 00:10:29.944
David Boder: Yes.

00:10:29.944 --> 00:10:33.835
Manis Mizrachi: My account number was one thousand four hundred sixty two.This was presumably the number under which Mr. Mizrachi was registered in Athens before boarding the deportation train.12

00:10:33.835 --> 00:10:37.124
David Boder: Uh-huh, all right

00:10:37.124 --> 00:10:38.638
Manis Mizrachi: . . . It was my account number

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:40.121
David Boder: One thousand...

00:10:40.121 --> 00:10:42.146
Manis Mizrachi: One thousand four hundred sixty two.

00:10:42.146 --> 00:10:45.044
David Boder: ..sixty two. And so...

00:10:45.044 --> 00:10:49.506
Manis Mizrachi: And so we have been put in big barrack...

00:10:49.506 --> 00:10:50.749
David Boder: You with your father?

00:10:50.749 --> 00:10:59.936
Manis Mizrachi: With my father and with my mother in separate barrack. And around us was the wires—electric...

00:10:59.936 --> 00:11:01.961
David Boder: Oh, electric wires. Yes.

00:11:01.961 --> 00:11:12.141
Manis Mizrachi: . . . have been charged. And we couldn’t go out firstly until the doctor came in order to see whether we’re ill or not.

00:11:12.141 --> 00:11:13.564
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:13.564 --> 00:11:23.082
Manis Mizrachi: And afterwards we could be with our mother and with every friend and so on because of our citizenship.

00:11:23.082 --> 00:11:23.843
David Boder: Oh, because you were Spanish.

00:11:23.843 --> 00:11:30.382
Manis Mizrachi: Spanish, yes. The only thing which we had. As Spanish people.

00:11:30.382 --> 00:11:31.685
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:31.685 --> 00:12:13.995
Manis Mizrachi: Of course, firstly we couldn’t eat what they gave us. It were carrots in boiled water. This was our eating. And we gave it to other brothers of us—other Jews—of Greece. And Polish people too who were with us in the camp.These were Polish Jews who had papers in their possession issued mostly by South American countries.13 And we were obliged after one week to eat because we starved. And so we carried everything—everything green that we saw on the earth we took it out from there and we started to eat it without caring if it was dirty or clean.

00:12:13.995 --> 00:12:15.960
David Boder: Uh-huh, without cooking?

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:16.902
Manis Mizrachi: Without cooking...

00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:17.693
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:17.693 --> 00:12:18.876
Manis Mizrachi: . . . like beasts.

00:12:18.876 --> 00:12:19.607
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:19.607 --> 00:12:35.492
Manis Mizrachi: And so they started to put us in this category of prisoners that starved to eat and wore closed and we had no rights to go out - to work - we were obliged to stay.

00:12:35.492 --> 00:12:37.487
David Boder: Well, because the Spanish...

00:12:37.487 --> 00:12:39.121
Manis Mizrachi: Because Spanish citizenship.

00:12:39.121 --> 00:12:40.665
David Boder: . . . we were not supposed to work

00:12:40.665 --> 00:12:52.199
Manis Mizrachi: We were not supposed to work but this was bad because the others who were out they were working at the transport of food, of legumes...

00:12:52.199 --> 00:12:52.810
David Boder: Of vegetables.

00:12:52.810 --> 00:13:05.931
Manis Mizrachi: Of vegetables. And they could have some profit in taking some of them. But for us it was impossible. And so we were obliged to live on only those things that we received from Germans.

00:13:05.931 --> 00:13:08.407
David Boder: Did the Red Cross help in any way.

00:13:08.407 --> 00:13:27.602
Manis Mizrachi: We had no help of the Red Cross. Never we got help from the Red Cross. Only our capos they had...many profits who unfortunately they put only for themselves and they never helped the others

00:13:27.602 --> 00:13:29.266
David Boder: Were the capos Jews?

00:13:29.266 --> 00:13:43.015
Manis Mizrachi: They were the Jews with us from Greece they came with us. And they started making friendship with the Polish capos, the old ones who were there and so they had a lot of...

00:13:43.015 --> 00:13:43.716
David Boder: Polish Jewish?

00:13:43.716 --> 00:13:46.854
Manis Mizrachi: Polish Jewish. I speak always from Jewish

00:13:46.854 --> 00:13:48.037
David Boder: And so?

00:13:48.037 --> 00:14:10.743
Manis Mizrachi: And so they made friendship with them and so they had everything for their own families. They had special room to live and they ate separately. We were not to see what they were eating, we smelled only the meat and everything else that they got...from the Germans.

00:14:10.743 --> 00:14:11.203
David Boder: From the Germans?

00:14:11.203 --> 00:14:24.331
Manis Mizrachi: From the Germans. And, unfortunately, our people—the people who didn’t want to beat and to collaborate with the Germans—starved and had only his home in back.Mr. Mizrachi probably means that those who were not capos lived collectively in the barracks behind the capos’ rooms.14

00:14:24.331 --> 00:14:25.032
David Boder: Yes

00:14:25.032 --> 00:14:26.064
Manis Mizrachi: This is all [slightly laughing].

00:14:26.064 --> 00:14:30.225
David Boder: Well, and that was in...Auschwitz?

00:14:30.225 --> 00:14:31.287
Manis Mizrachi: That was in Bergen-Belsen.

00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:31.988
David Boder: In Bergen-Belsen...

00:14:31.988 --> 00:14:32.818
Manis Mizrachi: Bergen-Belsen.

00:14:32.818 --> 00:14:38.063
David Boder: Well...did you hear about...All right, so how long were you in Bergen-Belsen?

00:14:38.063 --> 00:14:41.713
Manis Mizrachi: I have been there about eighteen months—one year and six months.Since Mr. Mizrachi was deported to Bergen Belsen in April of 1944, he would have been incarcerated there for twelve months, not eighteen months. He and his family were deported from the camp in April, 1945 just prior to its liberation by the British army.15

00:14:41.713 --> 00:14:44.551
David Boder: And then, where were you taken from?

00:14:44.551 --> 00:14:59.816
Manis Mizrachi: Then I have been taken—we have been put into a big train in order to be transported to Theresienstadt.Theresienstadt was the so-called “luxury camp” or “model ghetto” in which Jews, mainly from Bohemia and Moravia, Germany and Austria were not actually exterminated but died from hunger, torture, disease and beatings. Some 88,000 Jews were deported from Theresienstadt to extermination camps in Poland, notably Auschwitz. Towards the end of April 1945, the Germans brought thousands of prisoners to Theresienstandt who had been evacuated from other concentration camps in danger of being overrun by Allied forces. Mr. Mizrarchi and his family could have been among these evacuees had they not been liberated from their deportation train.16 In the last days—two days before the English came, the British troops came in Bergen-Belsen.

00:14:59.816 --> 00:15:00.276
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:00.276 --> 00:15:04.979
Manis Mizrachi: Um, this train was a big train of sixty-four wagons.

00:15:04.979 --> 00:15:05.650
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:11.045
Manis Mizrachi: And have been put in, again in...beasts-cars...

00:15:11.045 --> 00:15:11.535
David Boder: Cattle-wagons?

00:15:11.535 --> 00:15:23.731
Manis Mizrachi: Cattle-wagons. Sixty-four to seventy people in a car and started of course many ‘spense [?]...many sick...

00:15:23.731 --> 00:15:24.522
David Boder: Many sick people.

00:15:24.522 --> 00:15:27.360
Manis Mizrachi: . . . many sick people. We started then with the Typhus.Typhus is an acute infectious disease which in its epidemic form is spread from person to person by the body louse. As tens of thousands of prisoners poured into Bergen Belsen from camps in the east, a typhus epidemic raged in the early months of 1945 which claimed many thousands of lives, among them Anne Frank and her sister Margot.17

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.445
David Boder: Oh yes.

00:15:29.445 --> 00:15:34.630
Manis Mizrachi: It was then when I lost my two parents. Unfortunately, at the last days. I lost them—my father...

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:36.926
David Boder: What do you mean—in Bergen-Belsen?

00:15:36.926 --> 00:15:40.215
Manis Mizrachi: In the train—the big train—they caught there Typhus

00:15:40.215 --> 00:15:46.724
David Boder: Oh, in the train. About how many days before liberation?Bergen Belsen was liberated on April 15, 1945.18

00:15:46.724 --> 00:15:58.829
Manis Mizrachi: The first died...at just at the same...at the moment of the liberation and my mother which was looking for [after] my father died ten days afterwards...

00:15:58.829 --> 00:16:00.282
David Boder: After the liberation

00:16:00.282 --> 00:16:01.465
Manis Mizrachi: And I got it too...

00:16:01.465 --> 00:16:01.925
David Boder: You got it?

00:16:01.925 --> 00:16:05.094
Manis Mizrachi: . . . because I was obliged to see...to look for [after] for my mother.

00:16:05.094 --> 00:16:07.029
David Boder: You had to look for your mother, yes? And?

00:16:07.029 --> 00:16:11.431
Manis Mizrachi: And so I got it also—”I meant thirty in one days”[?]

00:16:11.431 --> 00:16:17.338
David Boder: What typhus was it? Ricket...Ricket...Spotted typhus?

00:16:17.338 --> 00:16:19.574
Manis Mizrachi: Spotted typhus, yes.Spotted typhus is spread by mites and causes red spotting on the skin. With lice borne typhus, a characteristic rash appears over most of the body. It the latter variety of typhus, not “spotted typhus”, with which Mr. Mizrachi and his parents were infected.19

00:16:19.574 --> 00:16:21.870
David Boder: So then you lost your parents.

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:25.490
David Boder: [speaking over each other] .. of liberation. And you remained alone.Mr. Mizrachi was an only child who “remained alone” since both his parents died of typhus, and he was an orphan.20

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:28.448
Manis Mizrachi: I remained quite alone without any help. Quite alone.

00:16:28.448 --> 00:16:30.955
David Boder: All right, so where did you go then?

00:16:30.955 --> 00:16:36.471
Manis Mizrachi: I was student and then the American troops were very kind with us—they helped us.

00:16:36.471 --> 00:16:41.264
David Boder: Well, which camp were you freed or were you freed from the train?

00:16:41.264 --> 00:16:45.546
Manis Mizrachi: From the train directly because it was an air attack.

00:16:45.546 --> 00:16:46.187
David Boder: Oh, yes.

00:16:46.187 --> 00:16:47.610
Manis Mizrachi: Attack of the air force.

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:48.221
David Boder: Yes.

00:16:48.221 --> 00:16:48.501
Manis Mizrachi: British Air force.

00:16:48.501 --> 00:16:49.744
David Boder: And so?

00:16:49.744 --> 00:16:54.477
Manis Mizrachi: And so the machine...had been in damage.

00:16:54.477 --> 00:16:56.291
David Boder: The, yes, the machine was damaged.The “machine” Mr. Mizrachi refers to was the train engine. According to testimony of American liberators of the train, the reason that the train was stopped and that the prisoners were able to capture some SS guards is that the train crew and other SS abandoned their posts as overwhelming American forces closed in.21

00:16:56.291 --> 00:16:57.233
Manis Mizrachi: . . . was damaged.

00:16:57.233 --> 00:16:59.860
David Boder: Yes, and the train couldn’t continue.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:06.489
Manis Mizrachi: . . . couldn’t continue. And...we made some activity there we got prisoners, the Germans, the SS...

00:17:06.489 --> 00:17:07.461
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:07.461 --> 00:17:09.937
Manis Mizrachi: . . . and we waited until the American tanks.

00:17:09.937 --> 00:17:10.247
David Boder: . . . came.

00:17:10.247 --> 00:17:13.837
Manis Mizrachi: Came. Yes, it was ninth army. The ninth American army.

00:17:13.837 --> 00:17:14.267
David Boder: Uh-huh.

00:17:14.267 --> 00:17:15.570
Manis Mizrachi: . . . Which liberated us.

00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:20.811
David Boder: Yes, so then you took the SS prisoners? Why didn’t you kill them?

00:17:20.811 --> 00:17:23.474
Manis Mizrachi: [slightly laughing] We had no right to kill them...

00:17:23.474 --> 00:17:24.450
David Boder: Why?

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:26.299
Manis Mizrachi: Because the capos—the chiefs...

00:17:26.299 --> 00:17:26.751
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:26.751 --> 00:17:32.143
Manis Mizrachi: . . . who directed this movement told us not to do anything until the American troops arrived.

00:17:32.143 --> 00:17:32.998
David Boder: Yes

00:17:32.998 --> 00:17:34.896
David Boder: And then what did the Americans do with them?

00:17:34.896 --> 00:17:40.167
Manis Mizrachi: The Americans took their arms and they took them away, we don’t know what happened.

00:17:40.167 --> 00:17:41.553
David Boder: They took them prisoners?

00:17:41.553 --> 00:17:42.920
Manis Mizrachi: Prisoners, yes.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.210
David Boder: All right, and then you were in the train,

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:46.035
Manis Mizrachi: And then...

00:17:46.035 --> 00:17:47.451
David Boder: . . . where were you taken from there?

00:17:47.451 --> 00:17:54.752
Manis Mizrachi: And at once, the officers, the American officers went to the village—the German village of Farsleben.Farsleben is a village located just north of the city of Magdeburg in north central Germany in the state of Saxony-Anhalt. U.S. troops of the 743rd tank battalion and 119th regiment of the Ninth Army freed the more than 2,500 prisoners on the Mizrachi family’s deportation train from Bergen Belsen on April 13th, 1945.22

00:17:54.752 --> 00:17:55.776
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:55.776 --> 00:18:04.692
Manis Mizrachi: There. And he gave the order to every person to take us in, to take several families into his house.

00:18:04.692 --> 00:18:05.457
David Boder: Yes.

00:18:05.457 --> 00:18:08.680
Manis Mizrachi: And so, we got the place for some days.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.680
David Boder: Uh-huh, and who was feeding you?

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.999
Manis Mizrachi: The Germans were obliged to feed us.

00:18:12.999 --> 00:18:13.963
David Boder: Uh-huh.

00:18:13.963 --> 00:18:16.132
Manis Mizrachi: They had a lot to feed us.

00:18:16.132 --> 00:18:19.186
David Boder: And what did the Germans then say?

00:18:19.186 --> 00:18:44.476
Manis Mizrachi: The Germans said that they never knew every-...something that happened to Jews and out of Germany and that they behaved something so ill with the Jews in the concentration camps that they let them starve and that they killed them. They didn’t know anything about those things. And whenever they knew, of course, they wouldn’t leave it...let the Germans...This was the typical response on the part of German civilians. They expended a great deal of energy denying Nazi crimes and engaging in willful ignorance.23

00:18:44.476 --> 00:18:46.054
David Boder: [finishing the thought]...they wouldn’t have let them do such things.

00:18:46.054 --> 00:18:46.837
Manis Mizrachi: Yes.

00:18:46.837 --> 00:18:51.024
David Boder: Uh-huh and then, where did you go and how did you go?

00:18:51.024 --> 00:18:56.476
Manis Mizrachi: Then I was where, I got ill and I went at Hillersleben.The town of Hillersleben, also close to Magdeburg, was the site during the war of a large German air force (Luftwaffe) base. it was also the site of a large German weapons research center. It was most probably due to these reasons that there were hospitals in Hillersleben.24

00:18:56.476 --> 00:18:57.078
David Boder: Yes

00:18:57.078 --> 00:19:02.018
Manis Mizrachi: Hillersleben is not far from them, some ten kilometers.

00:19:02.018 --> 00:19:02.741
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:02.741 --> 00:19:09.380
Manis Mizrachi: And then I meant the hospital, hospital El Melwani [?] there were three hospitals.

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.627
David Boder: Did you get typhus too?

00:19:10.627 --> 00:19:11.482
Manis Mizrachi: I got Typhus too.

00:19:11.482 --> 00:19:16.121
David Boder: So when they took you from the train did you have typhus already?

00:19:16.121 --> 00:19:17.428
Manis Mizrachi: No I didn’t have.

00:19:17.428 --> 00:19:17.820
David Boder: Oh, you didn’t have...

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:19.248
Manis Mizrachi: I was looking for [after] my mother.

00:19:19.248 --> 00:19:20.465
David Boder: You were taking care of your mother?

00:19:20.465 --> 00:19:23.549
Manis Mizrachi: Yes, taking care of her until she died.

00:19:23.549 --> 00:19:25.085
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:25.085 --> 00:19:25.718
Manis Mizrachi: Afterwards...

00:19:25.718 --> 00:19:27.706
David Boder: Did you see your father dying?

00:19:27.706 --> 00:19:30.248
Manis Mizrachi: I.... My father died on my hands.

00:19:30.248 --> 00:19:30.911
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:30.911 --> 00:19:33.664
Manis Mizrachi: I buried him with two other Jewish comrades.

00:19:33.664 --> 00:19:34.809
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:34.809 --> 00:19:38.676
Manis Mizrachi: . . . in Farsleben. And my mother died in Hillersleben.

00:19:38.676 --> 00:19:39.369
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:39.369 --> 00:19:51.267
Manis Mizrachi: They are seven kilometers away. I didn’t see my mother died - dead - because I was very ill at this moment. I was with 41.4 Centigrade...

00:19:51.267 --> 00:19:53.327
David Boder: Temperature. Already with typhus?

00:19:53.327 --> 00:19:54.291
Manis Mizrachi: With Typhus yes.

00:19:54.291 --> 00:19:57.875
David Boder: And so when the freedom came...?

00:19:57.875 --> 00:20:02.243
Manis Mizrachi: When the freedom came, I was quite alone I remained quite alone...

00:20:02.243 --> 00:20:04.153
David Boder: Did they take you to a hospital?

00:20:04.153 --> 00:20:05.039
Manis Mizrachi: Yes.

00:20:05.039 --> 00:20:06.166
David Boder: You were taken to a hospital?

00:20:06.166 --> 00:20:07.865
Manis Mizrachi: I have been taken to a hospital.

00:20:07.865 --> 00:20:09.534
David Boder: . . . and nurse to help?

00:20:09.534 --> 00:20:17.920
Manis Mizrachi: Nurse help, German nurse. And they were not bad but they always tried to make sabotage.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:18.745
David Boder: The Germans?

00:20:18.745 --> 00:20:19.528
Manis Mizrachi: The Germans.

00:20:19.528 --> 00:20:20.432
David Boder: In what way?

00:20:20.432 --> 00:20:31.998
Manis Mizrachi: In what way...because they were throwing away the medicaments and whenever we were calling them but they didn’t come—only when the Brit- [corrects] an American soldier was present.

00:20:31.998 --> 00:20:32.781
David Boder: . . . and then he would take...

00:20:32.781 --> 00:20:34.800
Manis Mizrachi: . . . but not, they never took care of us.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.914
David Boder: All right, and when you got well what happened then?

00:20:37.914 --> 00:20:49.481
Manis Mizrachi: Then I took some days in order to get...stronger then because I couldn’t walk. I had forty-two kilograms.

00:20:49.481 --> 00:20:51.692
David Boder: And where did you spend those days—in the hospital?

00:20:51.692 --> 00:20:52.758
Manis Mizrachi: In the hospital.

00:20:52.758 --> 00:20:53.331
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:53.331 --> 00:21:02.951
Manis Mizrachi: And afterwards I have been taken by the American army and I said that I had parents in France. And that for they brought...

00:21:02.951 --> 00:21:04.006
David Boder: You said that you had parents in France?The French word “parent” is the word for relative.25

00:21:04.006 --> 00:21:05.946
Manis Mizrachi: Yes, I had. I had.

00:21:05.946 --> 00:21:07.103
David Boder: Relatives you mean?

00:21:07.103 --> 00:21:08.711
Manis Mizrachi: I have relatives, yes. Relatives.

00:21:08.711 --> 00:21:09.946
David Boder: Apart from your father and mother.

00:21:09.946 --> 00:21:12.838
Manis Mizrachi: Relatives, yes. Relatives in France.

00:21:12.838 --> 00:21:13.784
David Boder: And so they took you?

00:21:13.784 --> 00:21:21.145
Manis Mizrachi: So they took me here and...unfortunately they had been displaced too. Deported and they didn’t come back.

00:21:21.145 --> 00:21:22.170
David Boder: They did come back?

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:23.357
Manis Mizrachi: They did not come back.

00:21:23.357 --> 00:21:25.056
David Boder: So you didn’t find relatives?

00:21:25.056 --> 00:21:28.442
Manis Mizrachi: I did find. And I remained here.

00:21:28.442 --> 00:21:30.894
David Boder: Yes. And for what are you working now?

00:21:30.894 --> 00:21:33.014
Manis Mizrachi: Now I am working for the AJDC.

00:21:33.014 --> 00:21:35.033
David Boder: For the American join...

00:21:35.033 --> 00:21:36.190
Manis Mizrachi: [finishing]...distribution committee.

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:37.045
David Boder: What are you doing?

00:21:37.045 --> 00:21:39.877
Manis Mizrachi: I am in the accounting department.

00:21:39.877 --> 00:21:41.335
David Boder: Where did you learn English?

00:21:41.335 --> 00:21:45.443
Manis Mizrachi: I learned English alone because I finished the German school...

00:21:45.443 --> 00:21:46.437
David Boder: Where? Greece?

00:21:46.437 --> 00:21:48.064
Manis Mizrachi: In Salonika, yes.

00:22:12.854 --> 00:22:16.420
David Boder: And learned it alone. Now what do you plan to do in the future?

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.432

00:22:24.475 --> 00:22:28.403

David Boder: You have no one.

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.319
Manis Mizrachi: No one.The forlorn note on which the interview concludes is symbolic of the loneliness of so many survivors at the time who had lost so much of their previous lives and had to endure the large void which these losses created.26
