The spool is for the time being 9-45A, containing the...interview with a...Polish, English-speaking marine, who trains Jewish sailors and fisherman, and 9-45B the beginning of the interview with Mr. Bramson at the ORT school. There is some other irrelevant material on the spool—apparently the apparatus, how it often happened was demonstrated to some visitors at the place of interview before privacy could be obtained with the actual interviewee.
