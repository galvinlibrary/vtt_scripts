David Boder: Well, what was the child doing all the time in the camp—or in the prison?

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:09.244
Marcelle Precker: The Germans at that moment were very nervous because the Americans were coming near Paris every day so it was terrible to meet them in the...

00:07:09.244 --> 00:07:09.802
David Boder: In the halls—corridors.

00:07:09.802 --> 00:07:18.169

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:18.727
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:18.727 --> 00:07:20.672

Marcelle Precker: Exactly.

00:07:39.005 --> 00:07:42.533
David Boder: All right, did you pay for that or what?

00:07:42.533 --> 00:07:49.422

00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:53.252

00:10:31.098 --> 00:10:31.957
David Boder: Oh [you were told that?]...

00:10:31.957 --> 00:10:32.802
Marcelle Precker: . . . had them.

00:10:32.802 --> 00:10:37.913
David Boder: Oh, at least they told you that. You really didn’t know, you were just told.

00:10:37.913 --> 00:10:38.471
Marcelle Precker: Yes sir.

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:42.858
David Boder: And you think that the Americans gave two German prisoners back...

00:10:42.858 --> 00:10:43.657
Marcelle Precker: I suppose.

00:10:43.657 --> 00:10:47.652
David Boder: . . . and the Germans gave back one Jew.

00:10:47.652 --> 00:10:48.481
Marcelle Precker: One Jew.

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:52.913
David Boder: One Jew. To whom? To the Swedish Red Cross?

00:10:52.913 --> 00:10:54.361
Marcelle Precker: I think it was maybe...

00:10:54.361 --> 00:10:57.451
David Boder: You cannot tell who it was. But it was to the Swedish?

00:10:57.451 --> 00:10:58.024
Marcelle Precker: Yes.

00:10:58.024 --> 00:10:59.532
David Boder: And where did you go then?

00:10:59.532 --> 00:11:04.009
Marcelle Precker: Then we were allowed to go...in family...where at home...

00:11:04.009 --> 00:11:11.999
David Boder: Oh you were released in...barracks? Oh, they let you go? All right. Now where did you live after that?

00:11:11.999 --> 00:11:17.879
Marcelle Precker: After that our apartment was taken by...French people.

00:11:17.879 --> 00:11:18.286
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:18.286 --> 00:11:26.125
Marcelle Precker: We were obliged to go in...friend’s family. But after that we found back our apartment.

00:11:26.125 --> 00:11:28.658
David Boder: When did you get your apartment back?

00:11:28.658 --> 00:11:30.844
Marcelle Precker: In September.

00:11:30.844 --> 00:11:31.794
David Boder: After the liberation?

00:11:31.794 --> 00:11:32.503
Marcelle Precker: After the liberation.

00:11:32.503 --> 00:11:38.669
David Boder: But before the liberation what did the people say? You came home to your apartment and wanted your apartment...

00:11:38.669 --> 00:11:39.197
Marcelle Precker: Yes sir.

00:11:39.197 --> 00:11:40.147
David Boder: What did they tell you?

00:11:40.147 --> 00:11:42.695
Marcelle Precker: They were put in our apartment by the Germans.

00:11:42.695 --> 00:11:46.117
David Boder: Yes. And where was the furniture—where was your furniture?

00:11:46.117 --> 00:11:49.192
Marcelle Precker: All the furniture was taken away by the Germans.

00:11:49.192 --> 00:11:50.248
David Boder: Your furniture was taken by...

00:11:50.248 --> 00:11:51.680
Marcelle Precker: All. Everything.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.550
David Boder: Did you have good furniture?

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:55.042
Marcelle Precker: Yes. Very good furniture.

00:11:55.042 --> 00:11:57.726
David Boder: You had very good furniture. Did you have rugs?

00:11:57.726 --> 00:12:00.274
Marcelle Precker: We had everything it was possible to have.

00:12:00.274 --> 00:12:03.274
David Boder: Yeah...You had everything that was possible to have.

00:12:03.274 --> 00:12:03.877
Marcelle Precker: And...

00:12:03.877 --> 00:12:05.143
David Boder: And that is what they...

00:12:05.143 --> 00:12:05.927
Marcelle Precker: . . . nothing remained.

00:12:05.927 --> 00:12:11.023
David Boder: . . . the Germans took away? And what furniture did the people have that lived in your apartment?

00:12:11.023 --> 00:12:12.907
Marcelle Precker: They had...their furniture...

00:12:12.907 --> 00:12:13.993
David Boder: . . . their own furniture.

00:12:13.993 --> 00:12:14.370
Marcelle Precker: Yes.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:19.812
David Boder: What did they say? That the Germans put them there and that they are going to stay?

00:12:19.812 --> 00:12:23.129
Marcelle Precker: Yes. But we succeed to...

00:12:23.129 --> 00:12:25.616
David Boder: That was while the Germans still were here.

00:12:25.616 --> 00:12:26.189
Marcelle Precker: Yes sir.

00:12:26.189 --> 00:12:40.420
David Boder: All right. Now we will come to that. Then, what...where were you when the liberation came? [pause] When the...who...where were you when Paris was liberated?

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:44.039
Marcelle Precker: It was at just at that moment that we were liberated from Drancy.

00:12:44.039 --> 00:12:46.979
David Boder: Oh. You were liberated from Drancy when...

00:12:46.979 --> 00:12:47.326
Marcelle Precker: Just when...

00:12:47.326 --> 00:12:48.547
David Boder: . . . Paris was liberated.

00:12:48.547 --> 00:12:53.763
Marcelle Precker: . . . when...Yes. One day before the American entered in Paris.

00:12:53.763 --> 00:12:57.743
David Boder: Oh, so why did the Swedes have to negotiate with the Germans?

00:12:57.743 --> 00:13:02.658
Marcelle Precker: Because.. you know...[unintelligible] concentration camp...

00:13:02.658 --> 00:13:03.125
David Boder: Yeah.

00:13:03.125 --> 00:13:06.171
Marcelle Precker: . . . just before the Germans leave.

00:13:06.171 --> 00:13:07.060
David Boder: The...

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.327
Marcelle Precker: The...

00:13:08.327 --> 00:13:09.005
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:09.005 --> 00:13:10.694
Marcelle Precker: [unintelligible]

00:13:10.694 --> 00:13:14.779
David Boder: Oh, they hear it was that before the Germans left they would kill all the people.

00:13:14.779 --> 00:13:15.533
Marcelle Precker: Yes.

00:13:15.533 --> 00:13:20.659
David Boder: So the Swedish intervened and they freed...what? Did they free all the Jews?

00:13:20.659 --> 00:13:22.996
Marcelle Precker: All the Jews who were in Drancy.

00:13:22.996 --> 00:13:23.825
David Boder: All the Jews who...

00:13:23.825 --> 00:13:25.845
Marcelle Precker: We were about two thousand at that month.

00:13:25.845 --> 00:13:31.483
David Boder: Well so they really didn’t count whether that they got that many Germans or not. I mean they freed all the Jews.

00:13:31.483 --> 00:13:32.358
Marcelle Precker: All the Jews.

00:13:32.358 --> 00:13:35.237
David Boder: And where did everybody go?

00:13:35.237 --> 00:13:41.177
Marcelle Precker: Some went in...[unintelligible] as we do.

00:13:41.177 --> 00:13:42.353
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:42.353 --> 00:13:44.660
Marcelle Precker: Also...

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:53.600
David Boder: Yeah...uh-huh. Yeah...Then...others went where?

00:13:53.600 --> 00:14:02.087
Marcelle Precker: At separate time...[?] in other places...we [traveling?] by the...at that manner that was called “ugit[?]”

00:14:02.087 --> 00:14:04.711
David Boder: Yes. And?

00:14:04.711 --> 00:14:06.023
Marcelle Precker: And stayed there...

00:14:06.023 --> 00:14:07.455
David Boder: By who was it arranged?

00:14:07.455 --> 00:14:11.103
Marcelle Precker: It was arranged by a Jewish organization...”Fugita[?]”.

00:14:11.103 --> 00:14:17.827
David Boder: Uh-huh. That was...Did they work while the Germans were here?

00:14:17.827 --> 00:14:22.154
Marcelle Precker: Yes it was...[speaking over each other]

00:14:22.154 --> 00:14:22.832
Marcelle Precker: Yes sir.

00:14:22.832 --> 00:14:27.128
David Boder: Yes. And then, so that’s where the people went?

00:14:27.128 --> 00:14:27.460
Marcelle Precker: Went...

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.304
David Boder: All right.

00:14:28.304 --> 00:14:33.400
Marcelle Precker: [difficult to understand]...before it [?] to them to [?].

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:39.475
David Boder: Now tell me what do you remember of the liberation? The day after liberation? How did that come about?

00:14:39.475 --> 00:14:52.621
Marcelle Precker: [difficult to understand—car horns in background] It was a [performance?] to...win them there because I [?] from Drancy that I should do it with my friend and I...didn’t go...[?] moment.

00:14:52.621 --> 00:14:56.541
David Boder: Yeah. But you hear that the Germans have left Paris?

00:14:56.541 --> 00:14:57.521
Marcelle Precker: Yes sir.

00:14:57.521 --> 00:15:00.521
David Boder: All right. And who came in?

00:15:00.521 --> 00:15:06.823
Marcelle Precker: At that moment, French troops came in Paris with American after that.

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:09.009
David Boder: And the Americans came in after that.

00:15:09.009 --> 00:15:25.637
David Boder: All right and then how long did it last until you had to get your apartment back? Tell us how did you get your apartment back?

00:15:25.637 --> 00:15:36.360
Marcelle Precker: As the people who had taken our apartment were put in by the Germans it was able for us to take it...

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.310
David Boder: To take it back?

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:43.446
Marcelle Precker: Back. Because the French troops tell us that if they don’t...

00:15:43.446 --> 00:15:43.943
David Boder: . . . move out?

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:47.049
Marcelle Precker: Move out...we’ll move them [from it].

00:15:47.049 --> 00:15:49.823
David Boder: So you just came and told them to move out.

00:15:49.823 --> 00:15:50.411
Marcelle Precker: Yes.

00:15:50.411 --> 00:15:51.059
David Boder: And they moved out.

00:15:51.059 --> 00:15:52.718
Marcelle Precker: They moved from the flat.

00:15:52.718 --> 00:15:56.834
David Boder: And then, you moved in your apartment? Where did you get some furniture?

00:15:56.834 --> 00:16:00.527
Marcelle Precker: My father had a very big country house near Paris.

00:16:00.527 --> 00:16:01.010
David Boder: He had what?

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:02.955
Marcelle Precker: A very big country house.

00:16:02.955 --> 00:16:05.925
David Boder: Oh your father had a country house near Paris.

00:16:05.925 --> 00:16:08.985
Marcelle Precker: Which was occupied [?] by the Germans.

00:16:08.985 --> 00:16:09.679
David Boder: Yes.

00:16:09.679 --> 00:16:12.830
Marcelle Precker: And [for the?] rooms...[we were?] furniture.

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:15.468
David Boder: What?...yes.

00:16:15.468 --> 00:16:21.709
Marcelle Precker: We...had to change to us from furniture remaining in the...

00:16:21.709 --> 00:16:22.704
David Boder: In the house there.

00:16:22.704 --> 00:16:26.473
Marcelle Precker: So we put them in our apartment in Paris.

00:16:26.473 --> 00:16:39.033
David Boder: Oh you had a house in the suburbs so you moved that to the apartment in Paris. All right. And then...the people moved out from your apartment without much argument.

00:16:39.033 --> 00:16:43.586
Marcelle Precker: Not very much because at that moment it was not very good to have be the friend of the Germans.

00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:59.732
David Boder: Now tell me how does it happen that still here people are suing others for their apartments and so they have difficulty in getting their apartments back? They say that there are still some people who have not gotten their apartments back by now?

00:16:59.732 --> 00:17:08.250
Marcelle Precker: Yes. But it’s very [intertwined?] if it is people who have lost a house...demolition by...

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:17.099
David Boder: Oh...if there are people you have had their apartments destroyed? Was everything destroyed in Paris?

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:22.768
Marcelle Precker: Not in Paris but many of them...[?] who were living in the...

00:17:22.768 --> 00:17:24.683
David Boder: In the country and other cities and came here

00:17:24.683 --> 00:17:26.025
Marcelle Precker: Yes.

00:17:26.025 --> 00:17:29.296
David Boder: . . . and they have nowhere to go.

00:17:29.296 --> 00:17:32.553
David Boder: And that is why some people don’t get their apartments back.

00:17:32.553 --> 00:17:34.558
Marcelle Precker: Yes. It’s the only reason.

00:17:34.558 --> 00:17:37.633
David Boder: All right. What does your little daughter do now?

00:17:37.633 --> 00:17:39.201
Marcelle Precker: Now she’s at school.

00:17:39.201 --> 00:17:41.010
David Boder: She’s at school? How old is she now?

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:43.302
Marcelle Precker: She’s nearly fifteen.

00:17:43.302 --> 00:17:46.121
David Boder: To what school is she going?

00:17:46.121 --> 00:17:50.222
Marcelle Precker: Now she is in school only for [?]

00:17:50.222 --> 00:17:51.413
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:51.413 --> 00:17:54.232
Marcelle Precker: Near Paris, at Buffémont. It’s a very beautiful place.

00:17:54.232 --> 00:17:51.413
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:51.413 --> 00:17:57.956
Marcelle Precker: After that she’ll be in a college in Paris.

00:17:57.956 --> 00:18:00.353
David Boder: What kind of a school is it in Buffémont?

00:18:00.353 --> 00:18:05.072
Marcelle Precker: It’s a French feminine...

00:18:05.072 --> 00:18:06.987
David Boder: Is it a private...private school?

00:18:06.987 --> 00:18:07.696
Marcelle Precker: Yes it’s a private school.

00:18:07.696 --> 00:18:11.118
David Boder: Yes, and so...Is your father back in business?

00:18:11.118 --> 00:18:14.676
Marcelle Precker: My father is back in business since one year.

00:18:14.676 --> 00:18:17.525
David Boder: Yes. He has his fur business again?

00:18:17.525 --> 00:18:18.369
Marcelle Precker: Yes sir.

00:18:18.369 --> 00:18:23.284
David Boder: Uh-huh. And you are working here with the Joint?

00:18:23.284 --> 00:18:25.606
Marcelle Precker: Yes.

00:18:25.606 --> 00:18:34.184
David Boder: Well, do you have many French friends that are not Jewish?

00:18:34.184 --> 00:18:35.797
Marcelle Precker: . . . I have some.

00:18:35.797 --> 00:18:58.681
David Boder: Well uh...how do they feel now about the whole situation? [very long pause] I mean this...Well there were of course all kind of French. There were some who were collaborating with the Germans...

00:18:58.681 --> 00:18:59.600
Marcelle Precker: Yes.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:09.791
David Boder: And there were others who were fighting the Germans and so on. Now, uh, what do they think? How soon will France come back to normal?

00:19:09.791 --> 00:19:14.193
Marcelle Precker: It’s difficult...to know exactly.

00:19:14.193 --> 00:19:21.550
David Boder: Well what do you think? [pause.] Can’t tell, huh?

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:22.515
Marcelle Precker: No.

00:19:22.515 --> 00:19:24.007
David Boder: You wouldn’t be able to tell.

00:19:24.007 --> 00:19:25.002
Marcelle Precker: No.

00:19:25.002 --> 00:19:40.409
David Boder: Now uh...tell me this...did you know somebody when you were in Cannes or so on...did you know something about the resistance movement in France?

00:19:40.409 --> 00:19:48.328
Marcelle Precker: In fact, I was [?] in Cannes [?].

00:19:48.328 --> 00:19:49.579
David Boder: You didn’t see much of it.

00:19:49.579 --> 00:19:50.152
Marcelle Precker: No sir.

00:19:50.152 --> 00:19:54.403
David Boder: There’s not much of a resistance movement there.

00:19:54.403 --> 00:20:20.807
David Boder: All right, Ms. Precker that is some very interesting material and I thank you very much. This is a Illinois Institute of Technology wire recording taken from Ms. Marcel Precker working at present at the American Joint Distribution Committee and...she was born in Paris and continues to live here. All right, thank you.
