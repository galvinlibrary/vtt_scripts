00:03:07.675 --> 00:03:13.164
David Boder: Now, wait a moment. Excuse me for interrupting. You were born in Vienna.

00:03:13.164 --> 00:03:13.759
Otto Feuer: Hum.

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:16.046

David Boder: Aha.

00:03:32.842 --> 00:03:48.620
Otto Feuer: Nevertheless, I, though not speaking a single word of Polish, was considered as a Polish national up to ’38, when even the Poles took, Poles...Poland took away this nationality and I was stateless.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.977
David Boder: Now wait a moment. In ’38, was there already a war with Poland?

00:03:52.977 --> 00:03:55.133
Otto Feuer: No, no it was one year before the war.

00:03:55.133 --> 00:03:57.108
David Boder: So they took the Russ...the Poles...

00:03:57.108 --> 00:04:03.515
Otto Feuer: All the Jews of Polish origin were brought over the German border. Oh that’s history, that’s known I think...

00:04:03.515 --> 00:04:05.339
David Boder: All right, let’s refresh it.

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:08.580
Otto Feuer: . . . were brought over the border to Poland.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.650
David Boder: And the Poles?

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.766
Otto Feuer: The Poles didn’t...didn’t give us permission to enter the country...

00:04:13.766 --> 00:04:14.143
David Boder: Yes.

00:04:14.143 --> 00:04:26.640
Otto Feuer: Because we had to [word not clear] we had to cross the border in such a hurry, we were driven by German policeman with bayonets and so on, that the Polish had no possibility to check our papers.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.228
David Boder: Yes.

00:04:27.228 --> 00:04:29.957

00:04:29.957 --> 00:04:30.243
David Boder: Yes.

00:04:30.243 --> 00:04:34.509

David Boder: Yes.

00:04:35.006 --> 00:04:55.445
Otto Feuer: . . . concerning our eventually going back to Germany, or at any rate that we were allowed to get some of our property out of Germany. And these negotiations were interrupted by the incident in Paris where the German employees of, in the German embassy in Paris...

00:04:55.445 --> 00:04:56.334
David Boder: Yes.

00:04:56.334 --> 00:04:57.555

David Boder: Grynszpan.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:08.078
Otto Feuer: . . . by Grynszpan, it is very interesting, the family of Grynszpan, the origin of this episode in Paris...

00:05:08.078 --> 00:05:08.545
David Boder: Yes.

00:05:08.545 --> 00:05:12.932

David Boder: Yes.

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:16.339

David Boder: From Hamburg?

00:05:17.078 --> 00:05:18.329
Otto Feuer: No, from Hanover.

00:05:18.329 --> 00:05:18.977
David Boder: From Hanover.

00:05:18.977 --> 00:05:25.203
Otto Feuer: And they wrote to a brother of hers...of theirs, living in Paris about the experience...

00:05:25.203 --> 00:05:26.213
David Boder: Yes.

00:05:26.213 --> 00:05:31.504
Otto Feuer: In consequences of, Grynszpan committed this murder here in Paris.

00:05:31.504 --> 00:05:34.052
David Boder: Now wait a moment, was he the brother to whom they wrote?

00:05:34.052 --> 00:05:34.851
Otto Feuer: Yes.

00:05:34.851 --> 00:05:35.650
David Boder: Yes.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.223
Otto Feuer: To draw the attention of the world, that was the motive of the act [?]

00:05:39.223 --> 00:05:39.660
David Boder: Yes.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:45.163

David Boder: Yes.

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:48.570
Otto Feuer: So [words not clear]...

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.083
David Boder: By the way, what happened to Grynszpan, will you remind us?

00:05:52.083 --> 00:06:00.812
Otto Feuer: Grynszpan I know, Grynszpan was kept in prison here in Paris, but I don’t know if he was liberated, I think so, he was liberated when the Germ...I don’t know, at any rate I don’t know...

00:06:00.812 --> 00:06:02.877
David Boder: But he was taken by the Germans to Germany.

00:06:02.877 --> 00:06:05.123
Otto Feuer: I don’t know, no, I have not the slightest idea except for...

00:06:05.123 --> 00:06:07.912
David Boder: Yes, well that is what the American papers said...

00:06:07.912 --> 00:06:08.259
Otto Feuer: Yes.

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:16.143
David Boder: . . . that when the Germans took Paris they...they took him for sometime away I think to Vichy, but he was in Prison.

00:06:16.143 --> 00:06:16.339
Otto Feuer: Yes.

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:21.570
David Boder: You see, and finally the Germans caught up with him and he was executed in Germany.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.118
Otto Feuer: So, I never learned about that...

00:06:24.118 --> 00:06:24.525
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:24.525 --> 00:06:29.756
Otto Feuer: It must have been...at that time I had already been in a concentration camp, and we...

00:06:29.756 --> 00:06:33.208
David Boder: Because in America there was a great movement...

00:06:33.208 --> 00:06:34.309
Otto Feuer: To save him, I...

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:38.907
David Boder: . . . to save him, and the French gave him I think a life sentence and kept him here.

00:06:38.907 --> 00:06:39.947
Otto Feuer: Hum.

00:06:39.947 --> 00:06:42.103

00:06:45.767 --> 00:06:46.415
David Boder: There was no war?

00:06:46.415 --> 00:06:48.661
Otto Feuer: There was no war, that was before the war.

00:06:48.661 --> 00:06:51.721
David Boder: All right, so they took you across the Polish border, what did you [words not clear]

00:06:51.721 --> 00:06:54.450
Otto Feuer: It was together with my mother and two brothers of mine...

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:55.038

00:06:55.038 --> 00:06:58.701

00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:00.646
David Boder: Hum...

00:07:00.646 --> 00:07:12.058
Otto Feuer: In July ’39 my brothers and I and my mother too, we got the permission to re-enter Germany in order to emigrate from Germany to the States.

00:07:12.058 --> 00:07:13.430
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:38.984
Otto Feuer: We came back to Germany and we had to settle our papers, it took some time because all the papers, all the papers which were required by the American consulate were, were available. And then the war broke out and we were arrested the 9th of September once more, my brothers and me, myself the ninth of September ’39, were arrested and were at first interned.

00:07:38.984 --> 00:07:41.894

00:07:50.653 --> 00:07:52.357

David Boder: Yes.

00:07:59.744 --> 00:08:20.884
Otto Feuer: In December ’39, let me finish that, one of my brothers even got the permission to emigrate to the States, and in January another brother of mine who has been brought at that time already at Sachsenhausen, a concentration camp in Germany, and in February, February the 10th...

00:08:20.884 --> 00:08:22.919

00:08:37.044 --> 00:08:37.662
David Boder: Yes.

00:08:37.662 --> 00:08:46.933
Otto Feuer: A prison, a prison of the SR and the SS, but it was...was not yet a concentration camp, so my first concentration camp was Sachsenhausen, Oranienburg.

David Boder: Yes.

00:08:48.064 --> 00:09:08.553
Otto Feuer: There I came in February, the 10th of February 1940, and my papers for the emigration for the U.S. were ready and I was invited by the American consulate at Hamburg to make my formal visa application; that was in April ’40, the Germans no more didn’t give me the permit...

00:09:08.553 --> 00:09:09.081
David Boder: To emigrate.

00:09:09.081 --> 00:09:21.126
Otto Feuer: To leave the country. I was in Sachsenhausen up to September ’40, and September ’40 I came as an invalid to Dachau.

00:09:21.126 --> 00:09:23.282
David Boder: Why as an invalid?

00:09:23.282 --> 00:09:30.156
Otto Feuer: Why as an invalid? Well I had some experience in Sachsenhausen which made me an invalid.

00:09:30.156 --> 00:09:38.734
David Boder: Will you tell us about that experience.

00:09:38.734 --> 00:09:46.860
Otto Feuer: [Long pause] Well, [pause] 

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:47.810
David Boder: Well, [words not clear]

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:53.524
Otto Feuer: Well, I was working in a...I don’t understand, what is a Steinbruch?

00:09:53.524 --> 00:09:55.318
David Boder: In the, in a quarry.

00:09:55.318 --> 00:10:04.378
Otto Feuer: In a quarry...quarry, and of course this work was accompanied by what you already know by about, we were...

00:10:04.378 --> 00:10:08.916
David Boder: Well, you tell us as if we know nothing, all right. It was accompanied by...

00:10:08.916 --> 00:10:28.234
Otto Feuer: Well we were ill treated...and at any rate I had wounds on my feet, I had lost about 25 kilos of weight, and I was no more able to work, and so they took one day, they took all those Jews and brought them to Dachau.

00:10:28.234 --> 00:10:29.636
David Boder: Those who could not work?

00:10:29.636 --> 00:10:31.008
Otto Feuer: Those who could do no more work.

00:10:31.008 --> 00:10:32.561
David Boder: Well.

00:10:32.561 --> 00:10:48.767
Otto Feuer: In Dachau I was from December [he probably means September] ’40 to June ’41; then I was brought to Buchenwald, and in Buchenwald I was from June ’41 up to April 11th ’45; then we were liberated by the American troops.

00:10:48.767 --> 00:10:53.395

00:11:00.707 --> 00:11:06.451
David Boder: Well, you pick what you think is significant, but of your personal experience.

00:11:06.451 --> 00:11:07.461
Otto Feuer: Well I should like to [word not clear]

00:11:07.461 --> 00:11:09.466

00:11:09.466 --> 00:11:10.205
Otto Feuer: Yes.

00:11:10.205 --> 00:11:25.021
David Boder: Suppose you are accusing the Nazis before the American people. Now what do you have to say against them?

00:11:25.021 --> 00:11:27.358
Otto Feuer: Well what I have to say against them...

00:11:27.358 --> 00:11:38.951
David Boder: Complete, what they have done to you. You see?

00:11:38.951 --> 00:11:46.383
Otto Feuer: [long pause] I don’t want to talk about what they have done to me, I want to talk what they have done to all of us and, for instance, what they have done to men, I also even want to talk...

00:11:46.383 --> 00:11:47.001
David Boder: To whom [?]

00:11:47.001 --> 00:11:49.911
Otto Feuer: Men, to men in general, to German men, to any...

00:11:49.911 --> 00:11:50.439
David Boder: To men.

00:11:50.439 --> 00:11:51.117
Otto Feuer: To men, yes.

00:11:51.117 --> 00:11:52.760
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:12:06.132
Otto Feuer: I want to tell you how they succeeded in changing...the brains of normal men, and I should like to give you some example -

00:12:06.132 --> 00:12:06.841
David Boder: All right...go ahead.

00:12:06.841 --> 00:12:59.878
Otto Feuer: One example. It was one of the most awful experiences I had in Dachau. We were working, in Dachau we were working. Of course we were, as generally, we were awfully ill treated. One day, it was in summer, in May ’41, about, I was standing there together working with a friend of mine, a comrade of mine, when the SS man came, a young SS man, he had about twenty years, and he came in behind us and he called my comrade. ‘Come’, well will you...stillgestanden (attention!) will you, will you put your hands on your...on your trousers. Well, then he had him stand behind a hole of water, how do you call it in English?

00:12:59.878 --> 00:13:01.913
David Boder: A puddle, yes a ditch.

00:13:01.913 --> 00:13:06.089
Otto Feuer: A ditch of water, about a depths of, of two meters...

00:13:06.089 --> 00:13:08.546
David Boder: Yes. Behind or in front?

00:13:08.546 --> 00:13:09.375
Otto Feuer: In front.

00:13:09.375 --> 00:13:10.053
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:10.053 --> 00:13:11.123
Otto Feuer: But with the back to the ditch.

00:13:11.123 --> 00:13:12.193
David Boder: To the ditch.

00:13:12.193 --> 00:13:13.022
Otto Feuer: To the ditch.

00:13:13.022 --> 00:13:13.731
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:13.731 --> 00:13:33.314
Otto Feuer: And when he stands there with the hands on the trousers, on his trousers, he kicked him into his stomach that he fell into this ditch, and he came...he came, his face came up, then he took a club...a club...

00:13:33.314 --> 00:13:34.143
David Boder: Yes...

00:13:34.143 --> 00:13:50.470
Otto Feuer: . . . and pushed him down, at any rate he pushed him three times, four times, as long as it was necessary, until this man was drowned. And he called me and I, I of course was ready to have now the same experience, but no, he had me draw him out.

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:51.601
David Boder: Yes, to pull him out.

00:13:51.601 --> 00:14:05.214
Otto Feuer: To pull, I had to pull...I pulled him out and I had to put him on a little...little cart and I had to bring him into the camp. We were working outside...

00:14:05.214 --> 00:14:05.983
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:05.983 --> 00:14:08.561
Otto Feuer: Yes. We were working outside of the camp.

00:14:08.561 --> 00:14:09.330
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:21.164
Otto Feuer: That’s not so awful. But the most awful thing, that now on the way, this SS man, a boy of about twenty years, he began to tell me how awful he...how unhappy he was.

00:14:21.164 --> 00:14:22.053
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:22.053 --> 00:14:35.455
Otto Feuer: He had an appointment for the same evening with his sweetheart. And now he had been ordered that he would have to do duty, and he wouldn’t, he couldn’t go to his date.

00:14:35.455 --> 00:14:36.495
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:36.495 --> 00:14:44.590
Otto Feuer: He was speaking to me without any consciousness that he just had commited a murder.

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:45.118
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:45.118 --> 00:14:52.007
Otto Feuer: He was just complaining, he was speaking to me now as...as...as one comrade speaks to another comrade.

00:14:52.007 --> 00:14:52.535
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:52.535 --> 00:15:17.385
Otto Feuer: And I think that, that even that, at that time I already was accustomed to a lot of things, but at that time I had the idea...how it’s possible that a man, a human being, can no more be conscious, can no more be aware of having killed somebody, and speaking to somebody who was only a chance that it’s not he who has been killed, like his comrade...

00:15:17.385 --> 00:15:18.305
David Boder: Yes...

00:15:18.305 --> 00:15:35.896
Otto Feuer: . . . complaining that he can’t go on his date. He has...He would have liked to get rid of all the staff and some of [word not clear] and so on, but without any consciousness of having committed a murder...

00:15:35.896 --> 00:15:42.514
David Boder: Now let me ask a question. This SS man...what was his rank?

00:15:42.514 --> 00:15:46.690
Otto Feuer: [several words not clear] it was nothing...

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:48.605
David Boder: A private?

00:15:48.605 --> 00:15:51.515
Otto Feuer: One can call him a private.

00:15:51.515 --> 00:15:58.555
David Boder: All right. Now had any private the right to go in and kill a person?

00:15:58.555 --> 00:16:03.032
Otto Feuer: Any private, any private had the right to do anything he wanted.

00:16:03.032 --> 00:16:04.408
David Boder: They could go in...

00:16:04.408 --> 00:16:27.382
Otto Feuer: Of course there was nothing forbidden for those people, and even they were...educated to do it. The were educated, and educated to do it. This is (?) those people they were really, they were taught to do a good job in killing. Of course they killed, they have lost any sense of...of...of consciousness. They...Feuer means “conscience.”

00:16:27.382 --> 00:16:42.533
David Boder: Weren’t there any rules for them? Don’t you remember whether any instructions - the Germans like [to] write, weren’t there any instructions what the duties, and the rights and the obligations of such an SS man in the camp were.

00:16:42.533 --> 00:16:54.503
Otto Feuer: No. The duties of his, the duites of an SS man were to pull out of the prisoners, or the detainees the maximum of power - the amount of work which is possible.

00:16:54.503 --> 00:16:55.577
David Boder: Nu...and...

00:16:55.577 --> 00:17:06.916
Otto Feuer: To do this is of course necessary to be very, very strict and to give very rude examples of cruelty to terrify the others.

00:17:06.916 --> 00:17:13.332
David Boder: Oh...it was really an example of cruelty...well did that other fellow not work while he...

00:17:13.332 --> 00:17:17.968
Otto Feuer: No he did not. At any rate, of course, this was only a pretext.

00:17:17.968 --> 00:17:18.529
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:18.529 --> 00:17:21.746
Otto Feuer: For the insticts of those SS men.

00:17:21.746 --> 00:17:22.217
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:22.217 --> 00:17:26.974
Otto Feuer: . . . to do every thing they wanted. That was...

00:17:26.974 --> 00:17:28.894
David Boder: Now, here a man was dead...

00:17:28.894 --> 00:17:29.636
Otto Feuer: Yes.

00:17:29.636 --> 00:17:34.785
David Boder: Did he have to report that he was dead? Did he have to write him off from the card?

00:17:34.785 --> 00:17:36.010
Otto Feuer: Yes, yes.

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:36.571
David Boder: So what would he do?

00:17:36.571 --> 00:18:06.729
Otto Feuer: He was...[word not clear]...died of starvation...on the card, or of...of pneumonia, of consequences of tuberculosis...that was on the card. Of course there was a [half a German word not clear] -karte for each prisoner. It is very interesting. The killed six million Jews...Jews, but/when] I had to evacuate [?] the ones who have survived, I found the same costume, the same shoes in which I have been arrested.

00:18:06.729 --> 00:18:07.351
David Boder: Ja.

00:18:07.351 --> 00:18:08.697
Otto Feuer: I still have.

00:18:08.697 --> 00:18:09.319
David Boder: Where did you find them?

00:18:09.319 --> 00:18:16.007
Otto Feuer: It was in der Textenkammer (store room for textiles) It followed me from Sachsenhausen to Dachau; of course I never wore it.

00:18:16.007 --> 00:18:16.267
David Boder: Yes.

00:18:16.267 --> 00:18:29.520
Otto Feuer: It followed me. It followed me from Sachsenhausen to Dachau, and from Dachau to Buchenwald. And we were liberated [??] - for prisoner to take, who took care of it. I got it, and I still have it at home.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:37.747
David Boder: Now wait a moment. I understand that when they took away from the prisoners the things they gave it away to others. They took it away...they...

00:18:37.747 --> 00:19:02.142
Otto Feuer: Not within the camps in Germany. In Sachsenhausen, Dachau and Buchenwald, they did not. In Auschwitz those people which passed through the chambers of gas, the clothes, and all the belongings were taken away and were distributed to...to...even to other prisoners; we...in Buchenwald, we wore later the [word not clear] suits of people who were killed in Auschwitz.

00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:02.824
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:02.824 --> 00:19:16.182
Otto Feuer: But our, our suits, we wore that kind. Those ancient prisoners of ’39, we were already considered as, as prominente...

00:19:16.182 --> 00:19:17.106
David Boder: As the aristocrats...

00:19:17.106 --> 00:19:17.728
Otto Feuer: Yes.

00:19:17.728 --> 00:19:20.945
David Boder: And you were of ’39 because you were a Polish -

00:19:20.945 --> 00:19:21.446
Otto Feuer: Yes.

00:19:21.446 --> 00:19:23.969
David Boder: . . . subject to be interniert as a Pole.

00:19:23.969 --> 00:19:24.772
Otto Feuer: Ja.

00:19:24.772 --> 00:19:38.341
David Boder: All right. Let’s fish out another episode. That is one accusation of one Nazi of murder. Now tell me another episode.

00:19:38.341 --> 00:19:46.991
Otto Feuer: It is not an accusation. It is more a humoristic episode, than...On August 24 we were bombed. Buchenwald...

00:19:46.991 --> 00:19:48.458
David Boder: The other one is a humoristic episode...

00:19:48.458 --> 00:19:48.868
Otto Feuer: Yes.

00:19:48.868 --> 00:19:49.158
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:49.158 --> 00:19:53.009
Otto Feuer: Buchenwald was bombed by American airplanes.

00:19:53.009 --> 00:19:53.872
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:53.872 --> 00:20:12.927
Otto Feuer: . . . and the bombing was made excellent. That means that interside the camp not a single bomb fell, but outer of the camp, where all the industry was, the factories were, they were all laid down.

00:20:12.927 --> 00:20:14.001
David Boder: Hum.

00:20:14.001 --> 00:20:21.353
Otto Feuer: Nevertheless the SS had forbidden the prisoners to leave those places, to go into the camp.

00:20:21.353 --> 00:20:21.673
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:21.673 --> 00:20:27.637
Otto Feuer: . . . and nevertheless we had about four hundred dead.

00:20:27.637 --> 00:20:29.587
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:29.587 --> 00:20:39.052
Otto Feuer: While in this moment there were others...amongst the dead. There were two...about one hundred and fifty SS and of course a lot of wounded.

00:20:39.052 --> 00:20:39.794
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:39.794 --> 00:20:53.213
Otto Feuer: At that time...This moment, the commander of the camp, he tried...Wir sind alle Kameraden - helft uns Kameraden. They cried to the prisoners - we are all comrades...

00:20:53.213 --> 00:20:53.654
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:53.654 --> 00:20:54.547
Otto Feuer: Helft.

00:20:54.547 --> 00:20:56.376
David Boder: To do what. What was there to do?

00:20:56.376 --> 00:21:00.921
Otto Feuer: To help, to dig out wounded ones, and to carry wounded ones, and so on, what kind of...

00:21:00.921 --> 00:21:02.237
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:02.237 --> 00:21:05.213
Otto Feuer: Well, [word not clear] at that time we were comrades.

00:21:05.213 --> 00:21:09.336
David Boder: Yes. What happened after the bombing?

00:21:09.336 --> 00:21:22.634
Otto Feuer: After the bombing? The war continued. The latter part the factories were not more standing...(we) were sent to other camps and the other ones were occupied to rebuild the factories...

00:21:22.634 --> 00:21:24.372
David Boder: The factories never worked (again)?

00:21:24.372 --> 00:21:25.670
Otto Feuer: No, the factories never worked again...

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:33.596
David Boder: Did you hear a story, they say something about an oak, Goethe’s Oak somewhere in Buchenwald?

00:21:33.596 --> 00:21:40.073
Otto Feuer: Oh, of course. There was Goethe’s Oak. [word not clear] Goethe’s Oak was the only victim of the bombing.

00:21:40.073 --> 00:21:43.170
David Boder: Oh...tell us what the legend [Footnote: The subsequent discussion has direct reference to the interview with Mr. Bramson, micro-cards, p. 823.] connected with it?

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:47.444
Otto Feuer: Goethe’s Oak was then...There was a kitchen of Buchenwald.

00:21:47.444 --> 00:21:47.945
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:47.945 --> 00:21:59.975
Otto Feuer: And next to this kitchen the was an oak, and on this oak, sitting under this oak, Goethe...Goethe is supposed to have written the poem: Über allen Wipfeln ist...ruh...

00:21:59.975 --> 00:22:04.943
David Boder: Oh...Tell me, is there anywhere in Goethe’s biography this oak mentioned?

00:22:04.943 --> 00:22:06.259
Otto Feuer: Yes, it is.

00:22:06.259 --> 00:22:08.782
David Boder: It is? One could trace it in.../word not clear]

00:22:08.782 --> 00:22:10.913
Otto Feuer: Goethe has been very often...

00:22:10.913 --> 00:22:11.806
David Boder: . . . in Buchenwald...

00:22:11.806 --> 00:22:13.394
Otto Feuer: In Buchenwald...

00:22:13.394 --> 00:22:16.098
David Boder: That is the verse: Über allen...

00:22:16.098 --> 00:22:16.750
Otto Feuer: Wipfeln is Ruh.

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:16.949
David Boder: Wipfeln is Ruh.

00:22:16.949 --> 00:22:18.295
Otto Feuer: It is one of the most...

00:22:18.295 --> 00:22:23.625
David Boder: in alle. Ja. I know...in allen Gipfeln hörest du kaum. einen...[hesitates]

00:22:23.625 --> 00:22:24.126
Otto Feuer: . . . einen...

00:22:24.126 --> 00:22:24.627
David Boder: einen Hauch.

00:22:24.627 --> 00:22:26.275
Otto Feuer: einen Hauch. Ja.

00:22:26.275 --> 00:22:33.718
David Boder: Die...Vögel schlafen im (recollecting) something...im Walde warte nur, balde ruhest du such. (complete text at the end of the interview) Is that...

00:22:33.718 --> 00:22:34.521
Otto Feuer: Ja, that is that.

00:22:34.521 --> 00:22:39.670
David Boder: Ja. Nun und so, what happened?

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:41.922
Otto Feuer: This oak caught fire.

00:22:41.922 --> 00:22:43.389
David Boder: From the bombing?

00:22:43.389 --> 00:22:43.618
Otto Feuer: Yes, from the bombing.

00:22:43.618 --> 00:22:44.451
David Boder: From the kitchen?

00:22:44.451 --> 00:22:46.008
Otto Feuer: No, from the the bombing.

00:22:46.008 --> 00:22:46.811
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:46.811 --> 00:22:51.326
Otto Feuer: It was at the border of the camp Gebau. [installation]

00:22:51.326 --> 00:22:51.736
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:51.736 --> 00:22:57.096
Otto Feuer: At about 200 meters and a single...

00:22:57.096 --> 00:22:57.989
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:57.989 --> 00:22:59.365
Otto Feuer: Also Brent bomb.

00:22:59.365 --> 00:22:59.957
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:59.957 --> 00:23:00.730
Otto Feuer: . . . fell into...

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:01.623
David Boder: Incendiary bomb.

00:23:01.623 --> 00:23:13.382
Otto Feuer: Incendary bomb fell into the camp, without doing another harm. But this oak caught fire, and this damaged, and had to be cut...

00:23:13.382 --> 00:23:14.456
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:14.456 --> 00:23:16.798
Otto Feuer: . . . directly after the bombing.

00:23:16.798 --> 00:23:25.297
David Boder: Yes. Now how was that oak cut? I want to verify another story. Who cut the oak?

00:23:25.297 --> 00:23:27.820
Otto Feuer: Prisoners cut the oak.

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:33.965
David Boder: Prisoners cut the oak. Was there a call to them, to come out to...

00:23:33.965 --> 00:23:37.152
Otto Feuer: There was no special call. But it had to be cut.

00:23:37.152 --> 00:23:39.373
David Boder: Oh, you don’t know...

00:23:39.373 --> 00:23:39.693
Otto Feuer: No...

00:23:39.693 --> 00:23:40.496
David Boder: . . . Any legend connected with that oak?

00:23:40.496 --> 00:23:45.071
Otto Feuer: No, I don’t think there will be any legend about this oak, otherwise I would have known it.

00:23:45.071 --> 00:23:48.500
David Boder: There supposedly is a legend about the oak.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:49.786
Otto Feuer: Could you tell the...

00:23:49.786 --> 00:23:59.009
David Boder: Yes. The legend is that Goethe supposedly wrote to somebody that as long as this oak stands, Germany will stand.

00:23:59.009 --> 00:24:00.506
Otto Feuer: I don’t think...

00:24:00.506 --> 00:24:01.520
David Boder: You didn’t hear it.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.353
Otto Feuer: No, I never heard it.

00:24:02.353 --> 00:24:15.500
David Boder: No; I heard that from another Buchenwald man, and he said that they called over the loudspeaker for volunteers to chop off that oak...

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.597
Otto Feuer: Oh, that is not true. I am sure that is not true...

00:24:18.597 --> 00:24:19.158
David Boder: That is not true?

00:24:19.158 --> 00:24:21.138
Otto Feuer: That is not true.

00:24:21.138 --> 00:24:24.204
David Boder: All right, they simply called the prisoners to chop off the oak.

00:24:24.204 --> 00:24:24.494
Otto Feuer: Yes.

00:24:24.494 --> 00:24:29.945
David Boder: That’s all as far as you know. Now any other episodes?

00:24:29.945 --> 00:24:38.603
Otto Feuer: Well, the most interesting episode of course, is the episode of our underground organization, in Buchenwald, and I wonder if this is already known?

00:24:38.603 --> 00:24:42.575
David Boder: [not clear, sounds like ‘certainly not enough’]

00:24:42.575 --> 00:24:52.855
Otto Feuer: It would be difficult for you to understand that we have built up in Buchenwald an underground organization...since...since ’41.

00:24:52.855 --> 00:24:53.115
David Boder: Yes.

00:24:53.115 --> 00:24:54.823
Otto Feuer: Even, even earlier.

00:24:54.823 --> 00:24:55.173
David Boder: In...

00:24:55.173 --> 00:25:13.725
Otto Feuer: You must know, it was one of the tactics of the Nazis, that they were put together...there were put together in our concentration camps political prisoners, religious prisoners, there were not only Jews, but a sect, a Christian sect...

00:25:13.725 --> 00:25:14.347
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:14.347 --> 00:25:16.689
Otto Feuer: The so called explorers of the bible.

00:25:16.689 --> 00:25:17.371
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:17.371 --> 00:25:20.860
Otto Feuer: And of course, criminals too.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:21.331
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:21.331 --> 00:25:21.892
Otto Feuer: Criminals.

00:25:21.892 --> 00:25:26.045
David Boder: How did the criminals get in there? What did they...? Liquidate the prisoners, or what?

00:25:26.045 --> 00:25:29.594
Otto Feuer: No, no. When a criminal had finished his term in prison...

00:25:29.594 --> 00:25:31.423
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:31.423 --> 00:25:38.896
Otto Feuer: . . . his sentence in prison, and he was considered to be dangerous for the German people...for the people.

00:25:38.896 --> 00:25:40.152
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:40.152 --> 00:25:42.283
Otto Feuer: They did not give him his liberty.

00:25:42.283 --> 00:25:42.693
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:42.693 --> 00:25:45.639
Otto Feuer: . . . but they sent him to a concentration camp.

00:25:45.639 --> 00:25:46.321
David Boder: Yes. Nu...

00:25:46.321 --> 00:26:02.275
Otto Feuer: Of course, they made those criminals most of which were very, very bad subjects, and very mean and very cruel; they made out of them to...our, our masters.

00:26:02.275 --> 00:26:03.259
David Boder: Trusties.

00:26:03.259 --> 00:26:04.152
Otto Feuer: [Apparently not understanding the word] Cartys.

00:26:04.152 --> 00:26:05.076
David Boder: Capos...

00:26:05.076 --> 00:26:07.810
Otto Feuer: Capos. Blockälteste and so on.

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:10.786
David Boder: Yes

00:26:10.786 --> 00:26:30.573
Otto Feuer: Now...in...this begin already in ’38, ’39, that a group of the first prisoners of concentration camp, that were the German political prisoners, most of them were communists, who began to build up an underground movement against those criminal prisoners.

00:26:30.573 --> 00:26:31.315
David Boder: Yes.

00:26:31.315 --> 00:26:40.176
Otto Feuer: . . . and this was a real fight. A fight between...the criminal prisoners had green triangles, -

00:26:40.176 --> 00:26:40.556
David Boder: Yes.

00:26:40.556 --> 00:26:42.083
Otto Feuer: We all had triangles.

00:26:42.083 --> 00:26:42.614
David Boder: Yes.

00:26:42.614 --> 00:26:45.560
Otto Feuer: And the criminals had green, the political had red ones.

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:46.816
David Boder: And what had you?

00:26:46.816 --> 00:26:48.283
Otto Feuer: We had red ones and yellow ones.

00:26:48.283 --> 00:26:50.112
David Boder: You were considered a political?

00:26:50.112 --> 00:26:52.273
Otto Feuer: No. We were considered as political Jews.

00:26:52.273 --> 00:26:52.955
David Boder: Yes.

00:26:52.955 --> 00:26:56.052
Otto Feuer: That were red...it was a Star of David...

00:26:56.052 --> 00:26:56.583
David Boder: Yes.

00:26:56.583 --> 00:27:00.615
Otto Feuer: . . . two triangles, one in red and the other one in yellow...

00:27:00.615 --> 00:27:01.810
David Boder: Why? Why?

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:04.212
Otto Feuer: . . . so be forming together a Star of David.

00:27:04.212 --> 00:27:10.115
David Boder: Aha...yes, yes...quite a color scheme...

00:27:10.115 --> 00:27:10.797
Otto Feuer: What?

00:27:10.797 --> 00:27:12.475
David Boder: Quite a color combination.

00:27:12.475 --> 00:27:12.916
Otto Feuer: Yes.

00:27:12.916 --> 00:27:13.387
David Boder: Red and yellow.

00:27:13.387 --> 00:27:20.467
Otto Feuer: Yes. Yellow was always the color for Jews...in, in the middle ages.

00:27:20.467 --> 00:27:21.511
David Boder: Yes.

00:27:21.511 --> 00:27:31.821
Otto Feuer: The Jewish star was a...was a yellow star in Germany. That is why they always took yellow for the color...to signify Jews.

00:27:31.821 --> 00:27:34.223
David Boder: Yes.

00:27:34.223 --> 00:27:56.575
Otto Feuer: Now this fight between the political prisoners and between the criminals ended about ’42, and it was the political ones who were victorious in Buchenwald, that means that that time the political prisoners had all the decisive positions.

00:27:56.575 --> 00:27:56.895
David Boder: Yes.

00:27:56.895 --> 00:28:06.058
Otto Feuer: They had the positions of the self-administration of the camp, that means most of the capos had become...were now political prisoners...

00:28:06.058 --> 00:28:06.348
David Boder: Yes.

00:28:06.348 --> 00:28:49.879
Otto Feuer: . . . and most of the people in the...for instance in the Arbeitstatistic - those people, who distribute, and who organized the work to be done were political prisoners. The hospital were...was in hand(s) of political prisoners, and the circumstances in Buchenwald - that is why Buchenwald compared to other camps, compared for instance to Auschwitz, or compared for instance to Dachau, which I know, or to Sachsenhausen which I know, was really the best camp, with all its atrocities...it was the best camp. For instance it was able [possible] that in Buchenwald in ’44 and ’45 that about two thousand people a day were called...

00:28:49.879 --> 00:28:50.833
David Boder: Yes.

00:28:50.833 --> 00:28:53.688
Otto Feuer: . . . should work, did not work.

00:28:53.688 --> 00:28:54.189
David Boder: Hum.

00:28:54.189 --> 00:29:11.441
Otto Feuer: Because they had...were people in the hospital could give for ill ones...papers which would...which ordered them for a rest. for three days, for five days, and six days...

00:29:11.441 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: Yes.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:29:20.091
Otto Feuer: And those papers of course were given by prisoners, and they, at that time, they had won the confidence of the SS...

00:29:20.091 --> 00:29:21.226
David Boder: Yes.

00:29:21.226 --> 00:29:33.679
Otto Feuer: They were no more checked by the SS - so was able [possible] that about fifteen hundred, two thousand and even more a day of...of...did not, did not work...

00:29:33.679 --> 00:29:39.281
David Boder: Well, did they favor only political prisoners or did they do it in favor of all prisoners?

00:29:39.281 --> 00:30:03.424
Otto Feuer: No, they did it in favor of all prisoners. Of course, it can’t be denied that political...who couldn’t work as much...when there was a question,...for instance, there was a question in December ’42.

00:30:03.424 --> 00:30:05.494
David Boder: Yes.

00:30:05.494 --> 00:30:22.202
Otto Feuer: All the Jews were checked to be sent to Auschwitz or to stay in Buchenwald. At that time, we shouldn’t be sent...it was not the intention to send us to Auschwitz; it was the intention to send us to Lublin, to exterminate us there.

00:30:22.202 --> 00:30:23.397
David Boder: In Lublin.

00:30:23.397 --> 00:30:24.170
Otto Feuer: In Lublin.

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:25.275
David Boder: Yes.

00:30:25.275 --> 00:30:38.663
Otto Feuer: Well we all took (?) at that time a medical, a medical...a visitation by the doctor...and the prisoners had to make the lists for those people who were determined to go there.

00:30:38.663 --> 00:30:39.405
David Boder: were assinged to go.

00:30:39.405 --> 00:30:42.984
Otto Feuer: Were assigned to go there..and those to assign to stay.

00:30:42.984 --> 00:30:44.813
David Boder: Yes.

00:30:44.813 --> 00:30:50.958
Otto Feuer: And it was quite impossible to say...that nobody would go...

00:30:50.958 --> 00:30:51.580
David Boder: Yes.

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:57.785
Otto Feuer: This problem even in Auschwitz was not much harder. You all know that in Auschwitz was selection.

00:30:57.785 --> 00:30:59.161
David Boder: Yes.

00:30:59.161 --> 00:31:05.638
Otto Feuer: And these selections were at first done always by physicians, by SS physicians.

00:31:05.638 --> 00:31:06.169
David Boder: Yes.

00:31:06.169 --> 00:31:17.143
Otto Feuer: Later, they were not more up to...they had to..they had enough of it...the older prisoners, the old...the chief of block...the Blockälteste.

00:31:17.143 --> 00:31:17.463
David Boder: Yes.

00:31:17.463 --> 00:31:21.012
Otto Feuer: . . . to do the selection. No you see (the) problem that...

00:31:21.012 --> 00:31:22.268
David Boder: Selection for what?

00:31:22.268 --> 00:31:24.037
Otto Feuer: Selection for the gas chamber.

00:31:24.037 --> 00:31:26.017
David Boder: Yes, and the prisoner himself had to select...

00:31:26.017 --> 00:31:28.691
Otto Feuer: The prisoner himself had to select...

00:31:28.691 --> 00:31:28.981
David Boder: Yes.

00:31:28.981 --> 00:31:34.854
Otto Feuer: He had to...to ‘reply’ this pri(soner)...this man is no more able to work.

00:31:34.854 --> 00:31:35.747
David Boder: Hum.

00:31:35.747 --> 00:31:38.481
Otto Feuer: . . . he has to pass through the chas cam...[slip of tongue] gas chamber...

00:31:38.481 --> 00:31:42.211
David Boder: Now [word not clear] were they telling them that it is a selection for the gas chamber?

00:31:42.211 --> 00:31:48.416
Otto Feuer: The prisoner, the Blockälteste was quite conscious, what it was, and the prisoner was quite conscious too.

00:31:48.416 --> 00:31:51.060
David Boder: Did they give him a quota of some kind?

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:53.764
Otto Feuer: No, they didn’t give him a quota. They told him you have to...

00:31:53.764 --> 00:31:54.808
David Boder: [apparently calling attention to the position of the micro-phone]...in that direction...

00:31:54.808 --> 00:32:02.643
Otto Feuer: You had to make the selection, and you will give us the names and numbers of those people who are not more able to work.

00:32:02.643 --> 00:32:04.442
David Boder: Oh. And then?

00:32:04.442 --> 00:32:17.679
Otto Feuer: And then...they would do the rest. Now you see, the real problem is this prisoner. If the SS physician makes the selection, he would have selected let’s say a hundred...

00:32:17.679 --> 00:32:19.448
David Boder: Yes.

00:32:19.448 --> 00:32:26.317
Otto Feuer: If a prisoner makes a selection, he would only select let us say twenty-five.

00:32:26.317 --> 00:32:26.788
David Boder: Yes.

00:32:26.788 --> 00:32:40.931
Otto Feuer: And this would satisfy the SS, because they were so...already annoyed, and too...too lazy to check it. All (?) twenty five, is twenty five.

00:32:40.931 --> 00:32:41.251
David Boder: Yes.

00:32:41.251 --> 00:32:50.686
Otto Feuer: But if the prisoner wouldn’t send anyone, or wouldn’t sent even less than this percentage [??] they would become suspected.

00:32:50.686 --> 00:32:51.791
David Boder: Suspicious..yes.

00:32:51.791 --> 00:32:52.986
Otto Feuer: Suspicious.

00:32:52.986 --> 00:32:54.168
David Boder: Yes.

00:32:54.168 --> 00:32:55.939
Otto Feuer: And they would do it themselves.

00:32:55.939 --> 00:32:58.467
David Boder: Yes.

00:32:58.467 --> 00:33:04.853
Otto Feuer: Now you see the real problem. This prisoner, he could save the lives of seventy five people.

00:33:04.853 --> 00:33:05.595
David Boder: Yes.

00:33:05.595 --> 00:33:10.955
Otto Feuer: By doing this selection. But he would be the murderer of twenty-five.

00:33:10.955 --> 00:33:11.577
David Boder: Yes.

00:33:11.577 --> 00:33:21.676
Otto Feuer: In this prison, there in Auschwitz, there it was in the most sharpest form. But this pri...this problem was always...

00:33:21.676 --> 00:33:22.962
David Boder: In what form would you say...

00:33:22.962 --> 00:33:24.006
Otto Feuer: In the sharpest [this word before did not sound clear] form...

00:33:24.006 --> 00:33:25.714
David Boder: In the sharpest form it was in Auschwitz.

00:33:25.714 --> 00:33:26.487
Otto Feuer: In Auschwitz.

00:33:26.487 --> 00:33:27.139
David Boder: Yes.

00:33:27.139 --> 00:33:35.397
Otto Feuer: But this problem...you can do something...There were people who were working for...in the SS kitchen for instance...

00:33:35.397 --> 00:33:35.807
David Boder: Yes.

00:33:35.807 --> 00:33:41.197
Otto Feuer: They could ‘organize’ [synonym for stealing] they could get some...some food stuf...

00:33:41.197 --> 00:33:41.577
David Boder: Yes.

00:33:41.577 --> 00:33:44.553
Otto Feuer: And they could give some foodstuff to somebody.

00:33:44.553 --> 00:33:44.994
David Boder: Yes.

00:33:44.994 --> 00:33:47.276
Otto Feuer: But of course, they couldn’t give it to everybody.

00:33:47.276 --> 00:33:50.463
David Boder: Yes. So who would get it?

00:33:50.463 --> 00:33:58.087
Otto Feuer: Oh, they gave it ahead to personal friends, and they gave it to their political friends...[pause]

00:33:58.087 --> 00:34:01.304
David Boder: To think, that was a tricky situation...eh?

00:34:01.304 --> 00:34:06.755
Otto Feuer: . . . it was...I don’t see a way to go out of this...situation.

00:34:06.755 --> 00:34:08.765
David Boder: Have you ever been a Blockälteste?

00:34:08.765 --> 00:34:11.560
Otto Feuer: No, I never...I have been a simple prisoner.

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:21.115
David Boder: How...how did one become a Blockälteste? How could one avoid to become a Blockältester?

00:34:21.115 --> 00:34:31.183
Otto Feuer: How could one avoid to become a Blockältester? Well at first...the first Blockälteste were all assigned by the SS.

00:34:31.183 --> 00:34:31.563
David Boder: Yes.

00:34:31.563 --> 00:34:44.106
Otto Feuer: When the political prisoners had won this fight against thee criminal prisoners, they had of course a lot of influence. You know there were good...good terms...

00:34:44.106 --> 00:34:44.366
David Boder: Yes.

00:34:44.366 --> 00:34:47.221
Otto Feuer: . . . between the leading political...

00:34:47.221 --> 00:34:48.024
David Boder: . . . prisoners...

00:34:48.024 --> 00:34:53.535
Otto Feuer: . . . between the political detainees in the camps and between the...

00:34:53.535 --> 00:34:53.873
David Boder: SS?

00:34:53.873 --> 00:34:56.004
Otto Feuer: . . . and the SS. The...

00:34:56.004 --> 00:35:00.429
David Boder: Well, would you not attribute that a bit...Well, what do you attribute to such good terms?

00:35:00.429 --> 00:35:08.053
Otto Feuer: No. Don’t think it was attributed because they were against [?? not clear] cruel things or some things like that. That is not that.

00:35:08.053 --> 00:35:08.433
David Boder: No?

00:35:08.433 --> 00:35:13.703
Otto Feuer: The SS was not able to organize, and to administrate the camp alone [by themselves].

00:35:13.703 --> 00:35:18.671
David Boder: Well wouldn’t that have been good that the camp would have gone to pieces?

00:35:18.671 --> 00:35:22.975
Otto Feuer: The camp would have gone to pieces. All the people in the camp would surely have gone to pieces.

00:35:22.975 --> 00:35:24.321
David Boder: Oh...that’s so.

00:35:24.321 --> 00:35:25.788
Otto Feuer: Oh!

00:35:25.788 --> 00:35:26.530
David Boder: Now...

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:35.270
Otto Feuer: [excited] They didn’t tell. Now you see you have...you all have not the right picture. For instance there were lice in the camp and there were some cases...

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.680
David Boder: Yes.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:39.531
Otto Feuer: Of...eh...spotted fever.

00:35:39.531 --> 00:35:40.123
David Boder: Yes.

00:35:40.123 --> 00:35:41.228
Otto Feuer: Spotted typhus.

00:35:41.228 --> 00:35:42.695
David Boder: Yes.

00:35:42.695 --> 00:35:46.938
Otto Feuer: The SS didn’t care. The SS made the quarantine, you see?

00:35:46.938 --> 00:35:47.711
David Boder: Yes.

00:35:47.711 --> 00:35:55.908
Otto Feuer: They didn’t care, what was going on in the camp. Yes? The prisoner had to get out of bed. [they] has to bury them, has to burn [??] them. You see?

00:35:55.908 --> 00:35:56.681
David Boder: Yes.

00:35:56.681 --> 00:36:00.049
Otto Feuer: The SS took care of it. The SS wouldn’t...

00:36:00.049 --> 00:36:00.942
David Boder: . . . care to touch the...

00:36:00.942 --> 00:36:02.982
Otto Feuer: Wouldn’t be in...inflicted.

00:36:02.982 --> 00:36:04.539
David Boder: Yes. Infected?

00:36:04.539 --> 00:36:05.342
Otto Feuer: Infected.

00:36:05.342 --> 00:36:07.231
David Boder: Yes.

00:36:07.231 --> 00:36:19.654
Otto Feuer: And that was...the prisoners...the SS didn’t take care if there were...toilet and so on. If there were none, there were none.

00:36:19.654 --> 00:36:20.396
David Boder: Ah...

00:36:20.396 --> 00:36:35.173
Otto Feuer: . . . but if the prisoners, the prisoners took care...those prisoners took care, that we, we were [had] orders of prisoners, that every week, twice a week everybody was looked over for lice...

00:36:35.173 --> 00:36:36.187
David Boder: Hum.

00:36:36.187 --> 00:36:38.167
Otto Feuer: They had to pass this...this...

00:36:38.167 --> 00:36:40.539
David Boder: Did the prisoners have DDT?

00:36:40.539 --> 00:36:57.891
Otto Feuer: No, they had not. We had nothing. Everything...We had nothing no...no, no such a powder. It was...it is unimaginable that we in Buchenwald...in Buchenwald it was avoided..an epidemic...

00:36:57.891 --> 00:36:58.388
David Boder: Yes.

00:36:58.388 --> 00:37:04.780
Otto Feuer: But it was avoided. It was avoided because twice a week we made the so called, Lausecontrolle [louse check up] where everybody...

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:05.700
David Boder: [word not clear, sounds like ‘the prisoners themselves’?]

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:19.514
Otto Feuer: Yes. Where everybody was checked when he...when he...when a louse was found he was completely shaved and he was bath and so on.

00:37:19.514 --> 00:37:20.765
David Boder: On your own initiavtive?

00:37:20.765 --> 00:37:22.288
Otto Feuer: Yes.

00:37:22.288 --> 00:37:35.147
David Boder: All right. Now...that is a very important point. Now tell me this...Well about [several words not clear]

00:37:35.147 --> 00:37:40.650
Otto Feuer: You ask...you ask me about what was to be done about not becoming a...

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:41.147
David Boder: A trusty.

00:37:41.147 --> 00:37:43.423
Otto Feuer: A trusty, a Blockälteste.

00:37:43.423 --> 00:37:44.765
David Boder: Yes.

00:37:44.765 --> 00:37:52.137
Otto Feuer: Well later, when those political prisoners [word not clear] had won, I have to tell you another story...

00:37:52.137 --> 00:37:52.755
David Boder: Go ahead.

00:37:52.755 --> 00:38:00.398
Otto Feuer: [note here the pitch of the reproduction spool becomes markedly higher. The equipment must have been sped up]. It is rather interesting, you know...I don’t know if you know that, that two physicians in Buchenwald...

00:38:00.398 --> 00:38:00.594
David Boder: Yes.

00:38:00.594 --> 00:38:06.911
Otto Feuer: . . . physicians who had killed hundreds of us. I don’t say thousands.

00:38:06.911 --> 00:38:07.107
David Boder: Now...

00:38:07.107 --> 00:38:10.710
Otto Feuer: [word not clear sounds like: ‘that I know exactly’]

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:12.233
David Boder: Yes.

00:38:12.233 --> 00:38:16.258
Otto Feuer: They stayed in Buchenwald, on their own will.

00:38:16.258 --> 00:38:16.695
David Boder: Yes.

00:38:16.695 --> 00:38:26.901
Otto Feuer: At ten o’clock in the morning there was the order: every SS man has to leave the camp.

00:38:26.901 --> 00:38:27.429
David Boder: Yes.

00:38:27.429 --> 00:38:31.394
Otto Feuer: And those SS physicians, they remained.

00:38:31.394 --> 00:38:33.007
David Boder: Were they arrested afterwards?

00:38:33.007 --> 00:38:42.037
Otto Feuer: Of course. We had them remain. We had them believe...when the Americans will come, oh, don’t be afraid, we will tell them you have been fine to us.

00:38:42.037 --> 00:38:42.534
David Boder: Yes.

00:38:42.534 --> 00:38:44.750
Otto Feuer: They really believed us.

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:45.549
David Boder: And then?

00:38:45.549 --> 00:38:48.820
Otto Feuer: Of course, later when they came heraus, we didn’t kill them.

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:49.167
David Boder: Yes.

00:38:49.167 --> 00:38:54.157
Otto Feuer: But we delivered them with all the records, we delivered them to the American authorities.

00:38:54.157 --> 00:38:55.740
David Boder: Do you know what happened to them?

00:38:55.740 --> 00:39:06.127
Otto Feuer: I don’t know, there will be a trial, there was a trial for Dachau and for...for Belsen. I didn’t yet hear about the Buchenwald trial.

00:39:06.127 --> 00:39:06.594
David Boder: Are there...[??]

00:39:06.594 --> 00:39:11.132
Otto Feuer: But these [SS] were delivered to the SS authorities, [corrects himself] to the American authorities.

00:39:11.132 --> 00:40:15.200
David Boder: Can you explain this to me about Buchenwald, just a kind of a human question that sometimes my temperamental American friends ask. Why was it that when the liberation came and the Americans still did not have things in their hands, why did the prisoners behave so well? Why didn’t they go out and say burn cities nearby and took rev...take revenge? [There is an interruption. Appparently some co-workers or subordinates of Mister Feuer at the office of the Joint Distribution Committee came in for instructions. However this also coincided with the end of the spool. —D.P.B.]

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:34.304
David Boder: We continue on the next spool the interview with Mr. Feuer. We continue on the next spool with the interview of Mr. Feuer.

00:40:34.304 --> 00:40:50.350
David Boder: This is Spool 65. Paris, August the 22nd, 1946. Mr. Feuer continues. Well, tell me, Mr. Feuer then...so...I had...

00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:52.114
Otto Feuer: You have asked me

00:40:52.114 --> 00:40:52.702
David Boder: Yes.

00:40:52.702 --> 00:40:54.014
Otto Feuer: . . . about the good behavior of the prisoners [both talk, several words not clear]

00:40:54.014 --> 00:41:26.321
David Boder: Yes. I am just...a question that I hear so often. How is it that the liberated prisoners behaved so well, did not get hold of arms, did not shoot the SS, did not go out and demolish the nearby towns like Weimar, although I think the Air Corps, the Air Force has done that. What accounts for that decent behavior?

00:41:26.321 --> 00:41:51.844
Otto Feuer: You must know that [word not clear] that there were several groups of prisoners. Two groups, two great groups of prisoners. That means that one group of about 80% of the prisoners who have lived during the years or during the months which they have been in the concentration camps, during the starvation and so...any person [word not clear]

00:41:51.844 --> 00:41:52.251
David Boder: Yes.

00:41:52.251 --> 00:41:59.140
Otto Feuer: And they were only thinking...walk around to find some food.

00:41:59.140 --> 00:41:59.487
David Boder: Yes.

00:41:59.487 --> 00:42:40.342
Otto Feuer: And to have some [word not clear...treat??]...And that was all that they asked from...from the life. And they had no more any personal will [??] And there were about 20% of other prisoners, who still had something like a will, and still was...There was the underground movement in Buchenwald. Now when die [these] were liberated it was not, it wasn’t...it was not too difficult for us - I belonged to those 20%.

00:42:40.342 --> 00:42:43.674
David Boder: Hum.

00:42:43.674 --> 00:42:48.634
Otto Feuer: To martyr the 80%. They were doing what they were ordered to do.

00:42:48.634 --> 00:42:49.162
David Boder: Yes.

00:42:49.162 --> 00:42:56.866
Otto Feuer: . . . by us. Up to now it was the SS who had ordered them, and now it was we who ordered them. It was not to our interest.

00:42:56.866 --> 00:42:58.027
David Boder: Then why did...yes...

00:42:58.027 --> 00:43:03.650
Otto Feuer: It was not at all our interest, we didn’t...we had dreamt of the vengeance for years.

00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:03.891
David Boder: Hum.

00:43:03.891 --> 00:43:33.711
Otto Feuer: And we had spoken about vengeance for years. There was not one appell in the evening or in the morning when we were not talking about...and we were always convinced, we were always convinced, that Germany would lose the war. We never had any doubt, never. We even had no doubt in 1940, we had no doubt, Germany must lose this war, and Germany will lose this war. We were not so much convinced that we would survive.

00:43:33.711 --> 00:43:34.058
David Boder: Yes.

00:43:34.058 --> 00:43:39.621
Otto Feuer: On the contrary. Most of us, and I was completely convinced that I would not survive.

00:43:39.621 --> 00:43:40.450
David Boder: Nu...

00:43:40.450 --> 00:44:34.647
Otto Feuer: But we were always speaking about the eventual...about an eventual vengeance. And we were not looking...we don’t think that this was the right way to go out and to...kill now German children or kill German women, because they have killed Jewish children and Jewish women. We wanted...that our idea to have such trials...as Dachau, as Nürenberg...But now, now of course it’s all I could see...but that time we had another picture of those trials to be. We wanted [to] watch, we wanted, we wanted to watch to see those SS men moving. We did not want to kill them at once. Those SS men we wanted that they should have the same pain that we had. We don’t...we want [word not clear] this is nothing, today is nothing, we were longing, we had time when we were longing [to do what??]

00:44:34.647 --> 00:44:35.446
David Boder: Hum.

00:44:35.446 --> 00:45:32.071
Otto Feuer: There should, these should, at first we wanted them...the workers to see, and then of course the German people to see. Who guided the German people, who leaded the German people? And we wanted of course that the German people became aware of the full responsibility. Of course it’s not only the Nazis who were responsible. It is the whole German people who knew about the concentration camps, and knew at any rate that they existed, and knew at any rate what was going on there, even not knowing the details [at the time??] when we were liberated. I...we were trying to find every SS man, and we...we...we...the Americans arrived about three hours late...after the Germans had given up the camp, and for three hours we were completely alone in the camp. And we already were looking around...we had arms, and we had arms always, we were looking around...

00:45:32.071 --> 00:45:34.287
David Boder: What do you mean you had arms always?

00:45:34.287 --> 00:45:38.674
Otto Feuer: We had...since...since ’43...were armed in the camp.

00:45:38.674 --> 00:45:41.885
David Boder: And what did you expect to do with it...

00:45:41.885 --> 00:46:00.253
Otto Feuer: We expected to defend ourselves. You don’t know that when the order came that every SS man has to leave the camp, there were people around, outside of the camp, and were ready. And in this moment we counted that now they will try to exterminate the camp.

00:46:00.253 --> 00:46:00.750
David Boder: Oh.

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:06.343
Otto Feuer: . . . the guards. For this moment we were prepared...to fight against the guard.

00:46:06.343 --> 00:46:06.780
David Boder: Yes.

00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:07.187
Otto Feuer: The guards.

00:46:07.187 --> 00:46:07.896
David Boder: But they didn’t do that.

00:46:07.896 --> 00:46:09.690
Otto Feuer: They didn’t do that now.

00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:11.032
David Boder: Yes.

00:46:11.032 --> 00:46:26.590
Otto Feuer: [words not clear, sound like ‘we sent a message’] to the American army, that...to know, that the camp [word not clear] we had a transmitter, a radio transmitter in Buchenwald, and through the camp [word not clear - operator?] we sent a message SOS. We also had a reciever of course.

00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:26.756
David Boder: Yes.

00:46:26.756 --> 00:46:28.640
Otto Feuer: We had radio receivers and the...

00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:30.675
David Boder: I [?] mean secret, you mean secret receivers.

00:46:30.675 --> 00:46:31.655
Otto Feuer: Nu yes. And -

00:46:31.655 --> 00:46:35.258
David Boder: What kind of receivers were they? Crystal sets or what?

00:46:35.258 --> 00:46:38.198
Otto Feuer: No. Normal radios.

00:46:38.198 --> 00:46:41.017
David Boder: And the Blockälteste didn’t know?

00:46:41.017 --> 00:47:02.831
Otto Feuer: No. [about two sentences not clear. Sounds like:] There were normal radio sets. The SS listened to the German news. But we had within the camp, in secret places, in a secret place we had a radio which we always could use and the [word not clear] can use.

00:47:02.831 --> 00:47:05.047
David Boder: So you knew what was going on?

00:47:05.047 --> 00:47:18.437
Otto Feuer: Absolutely. And we were much more [informed?] The SS came sometimes to us, and to ask us. Some of the SS were quite conscious that we were better informed by our radios than theirs.

00:47:18.437 --> 00:47:20.894
David Boder: And the couldn’t...didn’t search, they couldn’t find it?

00:47:20.894 --> 00:47:24.286
Otto Feuer: They couldn’t find it. They had no possibilities to find it.

00:47:24.286 --> 00:47:25.206
David Boder: Why?

00:47:25.206 --> 00:47:37.734
Otto Feuer: Why? Because even within the camp there was a complete service administration. And then even [??] in those places it was not so...not so difficult to dig into a place a radio, it’s not such a big thing and...

00:47:37.734 --> 00:47:41.518
David Boder: Why did they respect so much the Buchenwald people?

00:47:41.518 --> 00:47:42.196
Otto Feuer: Who?

00:47:42.196 --> 00:47:42.965
David Boder: The SS.

00:47:42.965 --> 00:47:46.689
Otto Feuer: The SS? Because...oh...they didn’t respect us...not exceptionally [???]...

00:47:46.689 --> 00:47:53.337
David Boder: Yes, but why did they take,...they had so much consideration? Why didn’t they make selections in your place, and kill them off?

00:47:53.337 --> 00:48:01.161
Otto Feuer: No at that time in ’44 and ’45 Buchenwald was not an extermination camp. Buchenwald was a camp to work.

00:48:01.161 --> 00:48:01.598
David Boder: Yes.

00:48:01.598 --> 00:48:13.462
Otto Feuer: And Buchenwald was a great assembly camp...From Buchenwald...in Buchenwald arrived always convoys coming from Poland, and from Buchenwald they were distributed to all the other camps in Germany.

00:48:13.462 --> 00:48:13.462
David Boder: Hum.

00:48:13.462 --> 00:48:19.537
Otto Feuer: So Buchenwald was an assembly for all...for all German concentration camps.

00:48:19.537 --> 00:48:20.607
David Boder: Yes.

00:48:20.607 --> 00:48:39.088
Otto Feuer: And Buchenwald was not a camp to exterminate people. People - anybody, a Jew - his duty was to do his utmost in working for Germany. And then if he dies while working, well it’s O.K. But in Buchenwald itself they didn’t exterminate.

00:48:39.088 --> 00:48:40.550
David Boder: And the selections at Buchenwald?

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:41.952
Otto Feuer: That was at Auschwitz.

00:48:41.952 --> 00:48:42.269
David Boder: And...

00:48:42.269 --> 00:48:43.249
Otto Feuer: That was in Auschwitz.

00:48:43.249 --> 00:48:48.299
David Boder: Yes. But you spoke about the...the responsible trusties who had to make the selection.

00:48:48.299 --> 00:48:52.445
Otto Feuer: [several words not clear] That has nothing to do. That was in ’42. [several words not clear]

00:48:52.445 --> 00:48:53.274
David Boder: [several words not clear]

00:48:53.274 --> 00:49:02.364
Otto Feuer: That had to do with selection...at that time we didn’t yet get frightened [??] There was not yet Auschwitz at that time.

00:49:02.364 --> 00:49:02.711
David Boder: Hum.

00:49:02.711 --> 00:49:21.676
Otto Feuer: And then when Auschwitz already was...but there was not yet the gas chambers [several words not clear] We didn’t quite know. We only were concious that during all the time we were in concentration camps we were always...afraid [??] to be unable to work.

00:49:21.676 --> 00:49:21.962
David Boder: So -

00:49:21.962 --> 00:49:23.545
Otto Feuer: That we were always -

00:49:23.545 --> 00:49:24.103
David Boder: Yes.

00:49:24.103 --> 00:49:27.013
Otto Feuer: It was always very, very dangerous.

00:49:27.013 --> 00:49:27.752
David Boder: Hum.

00:49:27.752 --> 00:49:36.963
Otto Feuer: Never. In this first selection in 1942, it was dangerous to be...

00:49:36.963 --> 00:49:37.099
David Boder: Yes.

00:49:37.099 --> 00:49:39.617
Otto Feuer: -under those who were non able to work.

00:49:39.617 --> 00:49:40.808
David Boder: Yes.

00:49:40.808 --> 00:49:46.491
Otto Feuer: Nevertheless the prisoners had to assign a certain amount, about four hundred peopl...

00:49:46.491 --> 00:49:46.868
David Boder: In Buchenwald?

00:49:46.868 --> 00:49:59.931
Otto Feuer: . . . in Buchenwald. Of course the SS...at that time the SS made it; but the prisoners were able to change in...in...in...several cases [several words not clear] to change the list.

00:49:59.931 --> 00:50:07.755
David Boder: Tell me this...These two doctors who were giving injections...

00:50:07.755 --> 00:50:09.187
Otto Feuer: Hum.

00:50:09.187 --> 00:50:13.453
David Boder: Lethal injections to people, in connection with what did they do that?

00:50:13.453 --> 00:50:16.031
Otto Feuer: It was ordered by the SS.

00:50:16.031 --> 00:50:17.976
David Boder: To do what?

00:50:17.976 --> 00:50:19.107
Otto Feuer: To kill people.

00:50:19.107 --> 00:50:21.202
David Boder: Which? The weak ones?

00:50:21.202 --> 00:50:26.493
Otto Feuer: That was a special kind of people, and it was several special kinds of people.

00:50:26.493 --> 00:50:28.166
David Boder: For instance?

00:50:28.166 --> 00:50:31.618
Otto Feuer: For instance. There were Russian officers.

00:50:31.618 --> 00:50:31.995
David Boder: Yes.

00:50:31.995 --> 00:50:36.955
Otto Feuer: Who were killed this way. Or Russian soldiers.

00:50:36.955 --> 00:50:37.784
David Boder: Yes.

00:50:37.784 --> 00:50:46.452
Otto Feuer: And we don’t know why these Russian soldiers. Of some we knew it were Russian officers, people of the French Resistance.

00:50:46.452 --> 00:50:46.919
David Boder: Yes.

00:50:46.919 --> 00:51:15.789
Otto Feuer: . . . some Jews - and we never knew - there was an incident...up to now we don’t know what was the reason for it. In ’43...at that time there were only one hundred and seventy Jews in Buchenwald, and they all were masons, and that is why they have stayed in Buchenwald, and they were not sent in Auschwitz - to Auschwitz. In ’43 it was the Jews who have built up the great [word not clear - sounds like Gussbetrieb - smelters or Gustoff Werke] the factories, it was Jews, they have been...

00:51:15.789 --> 00:51:16.829
David Boder: The Buchenwald Werke (works)

00:51:16.829 --> 00:51:20.161
Otto Feuer: Thanks to Mauerer - to masons...

00:51:20.161 --> 00:51:20.719
David Boder: Yes.

00:51:20.719 --> 00:51:25.528
Otto Feuer: They were masons. They were very good masons, very efficient masons.

00:51:25.528 --> 00:51:27.171
David Boder: Yes. [word not clear]

00:51:27.171 --> 00:51:42.572
Otto Feuer: When somebody came to visit the camp, I remember [??] this, the commander of the camp, he showed the factory and he told the high German generals, a German general who told it; ‘you see, that is all my Jews who have built this’.

00:51:42.572 --> 00:51:45.391
David Boder: Yes. Were they Freimaurer?

00:51:45.391 --> 00:51:46.371
Otto Feuer: No...no...

00:51:46.371 --> 00:51:49.401
David Boder: Oh, you called them masons because the were artisan-masons.

00:51:49.401 --> 00:51:49.838
Otto Feuer: Yes, yes.

00:51:49.838 --> 00:51:52.506
David Boder: You see, I understood masons in the sense of Freimaurer.

00:51:52.506 --> 00:51:54.662
Otto Feuer: No, no.

00:51:54.662 --> 00:51:56.305
David Boder: So they were experienced...

00:51:56.305 --> 00:51:59.094
Otto Feuer: No, they were experienced masons...[several words not clear]

00:51:59.094 --> 00:51:59.953
David Boder: . . . and they built a house...

00:51:59.953 --> 00:52:01.807
Otto Feuer: . . . they built factories.

00:52:01.807 --> 00:52:03.752
David Boder: Yes.

00:52:03.752 --> 00:52:20.749
Otto Feuer: . . . in the summer ’43, the factories had been built. And without any reason, some Jews, the names of some Jews were written down when working, under the pretext - they have been late.

00:52:20.749 --> 00:52:21.910
David Boder: Yes.

00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:26.357
Otto Feuer: The next day they got twenty-five strokes with a club.

00:52:26.357 --> 00:52:27.277
David Boder: Each one?

00:52:27.277 --> 00:52:28.950
Otto Feuer: Each one, and then...

00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:30.563
David Boder: When, during the Appell?

00:52:30.563 --> 00:52:37.030
Otto Feuer: No, after the Appell, after the evening Appell, and then they were sent to the hospital.

00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:38.131
David Boder: To the infirmary.

00:52:38.131 --> 00:52:43.648
Otto Feuer: . . . to the infirmary, and there they got the deadly injection...by one of those...

00:52:43.648 --> 00:52:44.025
David Boder: Physicians.

00:52:44.025 --> 00:52:47.688
Otto Feuer: Physicians.

00:52:47.688 --> 00:52:49.934
David Boder: And you think it was what? An experiment?

00:52:49.934 --> 00:53:02.100
Otto Feuer: No, it wasn’t an experiment. It is...as far as we know, it was only the person who was hated [by Lange??] the leader of the camp. [several words not clear]

00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:03.351
David Boder: Hated whom?

00:53:03.351 --> 00:53:05.326
Otto Feuer: Hatred against the Jews.

00:53:05.326 --> 00:53:05.552
David Boder: Hum...

00:53:05.552 --> 00:53:14.341
Otto Feuer: So if he wanted...he picked up some...One day he had picked up five young jews who were very good masons.

00:53:14.341 --> 00:53:16.587
David Boder: Meaning construction workers?

00:53:16.587 --> 00:53:17.265
Otto Feuer: Construction workers.

00:53:17.265 --> 00:53:19.783
David Boder: When you say to an American, a mason.

00:53:19.783 --> 00:53:20.944
Otto Feuer: It is a Free-mason.

00:53:20.944 --> 00:53:22.949
David Boder: It is Freimaurer.

00:53:22.949 --> 00:53:26.100
Otto Feuer: I now know [??] A construction worker.

00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:27.713
David Boder: Yes.

00:53:27.713 --> 00:53:57.910
Otto Feuer: Well. And they were very strong, and...they were very good at work [??] and those five...their names were written down...and they got about their twenty...about fifteen strokes, at that time those numbered only fifteen [??] they were sent to the hospital, and there they got the deadly injection. [about 5-7 words not clear] the last [word not clear] they had already the injection in the arm. And they knew what was going on. And they told a comrade who [??] passed at the window, with the possibility to see them...

00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:58.468
David Boder: Yes.

00:53:58.468 --> 00:54:04.483
Otto Feuer: One of them told him - I can only tell you in German.

00:54:04.483 --> 00:54:04.800
David Boder: Yes.

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:10.091
Otto Feuer: ‘Ich habe jetzt zwei liter haferflocken gegessen, süss wie zucker’ [I have just eaten two liters of oatflakes. Sweet as sugar]

00:54:10.091 --> 00:54:10.468
David Boder: Nu.

00:54:10.468 --> 00:54:17.960
Otto Feuer: ‘Und die haben mir so gut geschmackt; sie sind ja auch so gesund’ [and they were so delicious, they are so good for one’s health]...You know what...?

00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:18.910
David Boder: Wer hat das gesagt? [Who said that?]

00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:24.171
Otto Feuer: [continues in German] The man who had the injection in the arm, was not to live within an hour.

00:54:24.171 --> 00:54:24.849
David Boder: Ja.

00:54:24.849 --> 00:54:27.156
Otto Feuer: [in English] You know what that is - cynic?

00:54:27.156 --> 00:54:27.895
David Boder: What?

00:54:27.895 --> 00:54:28.965
Otto Feuer: Cynicism.

00:54:28.965 --> 00:54:30.156
David Boder: Ja.

00:54:30.156 --> 00:54:33.216
Otto Feuer: Er hat gesagt: ‘Ich habe jetzt zwei liter Hafterflocken..!’ [I have just eaten two liters of oatflakes]...

00:54:33.216 --> 00:54:33.744
David Boder: Yes.

00:54:33.744 --> 00:54:35.327
Otto Feuer: ‘...sie haben mir wunderbar geschmeckt’ [they were so delicious]

00:54:35.327 --> 00:54:36.488
David Boder: Haferflocken waren eine suppe? [oatflakes were a soup?]

00:54:36.488 --> 00:54:39.277
Otto Feuer: Haferflocken were a nicer...die [word not clear] Suppe, es war eine besondere Suppe [it was a special soup]

00:54:39.277 --> 00:54:39.774
David Boder: Yes.

00:54:39.774 --> 00:54:42.352
Otto Feuer: Eine gute Suppe [a good soup]

00:54:42.352 --> 00:54:48.096
David Boder: [apparently translates] Two liters of flake soup.

00:54:48.096 --> 00:54:48.684
Otto Feuer: Yes.

00:54:48.684 --> 00:54:50.448
David Boder: And I feel wonderful.

00:54:50.448 --> 00:54:54.262
Otto Feuer: [word not clear] and I feel wonderful.

00:54:54.262 --> 00:54:56.840
David Boder: Don’t you think that the injection may have had that kind of [effect]

00:54:56.840 --> 00:55:01.016
Otto Feuer: No, no, no. The same evening, I can tell you I met a Jew...

00:55:01.016 --> 00:55:01.544
David Boder: Ja.

00:55:01.544 --> 00:55:05.961
Otto Feuer: That same evening, there was a new prisoner.

00:55:05.961 --> 00:55:06.368
David Boder: Ja.

00:55:06.368 --> 00:55:08.072
Otto Feuer: A Jew of about sixty years.

00:55:08.072 --> 00:55:09.715
David Boder: Ja.

00:55:09.715 --> 00:55:19.017
Otto Feuer: You must realize that at this time we were all convinced, the only logical conclusion we could make was - it was now the time they wanted to exterminate all of us.

00:55:19.017 --> 00:55:19.484
David Boder: Yes.

00:55:19.484 --> 00:55:23.569
Otto Feuer: We were all convinced, now the time is come, it was summer ’43.

00:55:23.569 --> 00:55:24.308
David Boder: Yes.

00:55:24.308 --> 00:55:26.705
Otto Feuer: We were convinced now [words not clear] we were all convinced...

00:55:26.705 --> 00:55:30.007
David Boder: Why didn’t you rebel then? Why wasn’t there a fight then?

00:55:30.007 --> 00:55:31.047
Otto Feuer: How...how do you want us to rebel?

00:55:31.047 --> 00:55:31.756
David Boder: [several words not clear]

00:55:31.756 --> 00:55:40.605
Otto Feuer: We were hundred and seventy Jews. Arms? How can you fight them - with a revolver. Against machine guns, flame throwers.

00:55:40.605 --> 00:55:41.193
David Boder: Ja.

00:55:41.193 --> 00:55:50.766
Otto Feuer: . . . against...do you know, how...do you know the towers of Buchenwald? How the towers...with the machine guns, with armored [word not clear] with flame throwers...

00:55:50.766 --> 00:55:51.396
David Boder: Yes?

00:55:51.396 --> 00:55:53.646
Otto Feuer: How do you want us to fight?

00:55:53.646 --> 00:55:54.246
David Boder: Hum.

00:55:54.246 --> 00:56:01.386
Otto Feuer: We had no possibility to make a real fight, to...ha...before we could approach, we would have been killed.

00:56:01.386 --> 00:56:04.896
David Boder: Ja. Was it surrounded with electric wire?

00:56:04.896 --> 00:56:05.946
Otto Feuer: Of course it was surrounded with electric wire.

00:56:05.946 --> 00:56:08.736
David Boder: Were there cases of suicide at the electric wire?

00:56:08.736 --> 00:56:09.876
Otto Feuer: Of course there were.

00:56:09.876 --> 00:56:12.036
David Boder: Often? Many?

00:56:12.036 --> 00:56:31.266
Otto Feuer: Not too much. No, no...the will to live. There were not too much compared with all the things there were not...too much suicides in Buchenwald. People wanted to live. With all this they wanted to live. They could no more go, they could no more march, but they wanted to live. They didn’t want to stie [correcting himself] to die [a slip of the tongue apparently a fusion of the st from the word sterben meaning die, and the English word die]

00:56:31.266 --> 00:56:34.116
David Boder: Could you tell me what did they call a Mussulman?

00:56:34.116 --> 00:56:39.486
Otto Feuer: A Mussulman? That is somebody who is unable to work.

00:56:39.486 --> 00:56:39.996
David Boder: And what...

00:56:39.996 --> 00:56:48.726
Otto Feuer: Who is unable to work, who is no more able to march, ride...and to run no more, and no more to behave...

00:56:48.726 --> 00:56:48.996
David Boder: Yes.

00:56:48.996 --> 00:56:52.026
Otto Feuer: . . . how he has to behave in this concentration camp - he was called a Mussulman.

00:56:52.026 --> 00:56:53.496
David Boder: An emaciated person...

00:56:53.496 --> 00:56:54.186
Otto Feuer: Yes.

00:56:54.186 --> 00:57:00.666
David Boder: Now tell me, have you an idea, what is the philology of the word? Where does it come from?

00:57:00.666 --> 00:57:03.350
Otto Feuer: Mussulman that is of course...it is...you know...

00:57:03.350 --> 00:57:05.990
David Boder: You think it means a Mussulman, a Mohammedan...

00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:07.550
Otto Feuer: Of course...yes.

00:57:07.550 --> 00:57:20.330
David Boder: Now why would they give such a name? [a pause] Did you never talk about it, did it never occure to you to get, so to say, the semantics of the word?

00:57:20.330 --> 00:57:24.740
Otto Feuer: But it is quite sure that this is the origin of the word.

00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:25.160
David Boder: Ja.

00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:29.720
Otto Feuer: They had this picture, the German had this picture, the Mussulman is quite strange to the German.

00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:30.290
David Boder: Yes.

00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:35.240
Otto Feuer: You see. And this picture was created by German...by Germans. By German prisoners.

00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:35.990
David Boder: Yes.

00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:48.620
Otto Feuer: Or by German SS even. But it is...the imagination of a Mussulman is so strange to a German. Somebody who has a particular hat on his head.

00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:48.890
David Boder: Yes.

00:57:48.890 --> 00:58:03.320
Otto Feuer: And to have [several words not clear] and that is a Mussulman. And you know we had our hats, our caps and so on, might be that this was some like this.

00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:20.810
David Boder: Now, tell me, I have still this other question. You started telling me something about the character of the capos. You said that before. What were they? You say, not all of them were criminals?

00:58:20.810 --> 00:58:42.560
Otto Feuer: Not all of them were criminals. [were] some of them, and a little amount of them were very good people. But you must, you must see the cause [??]...They were simple prisoners, never can...I couldn’t understand that time [??] and I was kicked enough...

00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:43.100
David Boder: Ja.

00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:48.110
Otto Feuer: But I am quite sure, that...I remember one thing, when an SS man was looking for me...

00:58:48.110 --> 00:58:48.380
David Boder: Yes.

00:58:48.380 --> 00:59:05.750
Otto Feuer: And was trying to, to ill treat me, to strike me and so on, that the capo came and began to chase me, and began to cry - you lousy Jew, and so on. Was?Willst du machen dass du weg kommst. [get out of here] But by doing that, he chased me away.

00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:06.290
David Boder: Yes.

00:59:06.290 --> 00:59:10.400
Otto Feuer: And then I...I was liberated from the SS man.

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:11.450
David Boder: Aha.

00:59:11.450 --> 00:59:12.320
Otto Feuer: You see.

00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:12.650
David Boder: Ja.

00:59:12.650 --> 00:59:27.020
Otto Feuer: And that of course a simple prisoner...and I at that time, I couldn’t understand. The simple prisoner could never understand...why the capo ist so, and why the capo ist so. I won’t I won’t excuse all of them...

00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:27.590
David Boder: Nu...Ja.

00:59:27.590 --> 00:59:40.460
Otto Feuer: There is...at least half of them really were criminals, who really did all this work for...to have some more bread [word not clear] to have this power, to have the position and to have - don’t be forced to work and so on.

00:59:40.460 --> 01:00:35.569
David Boder: Ja. [pause] Mr. Feuer...Mr. Feuer, there is another question that I can not ask the other people. What do you know about the whole sex situation in the camps. First of all, how did the treat women prisoners. You have interviewed here people, here and there, and so to what extent were the women sexually abused, or not sexually abused?

01:00:35.569 --> 01:00:47.209
Otto Feuer: In reality I never learned that, for instance, [that] a Jewish woman has been abused by an SS man, in the concentration camps.

01:00:47.209 --> 01:00:48.109
David Boder: You have not heard?

01:00:48.109 --> 01:00:55.939
Otto Feuer: I have not heard about it...that Jewish women, of course in Poland...

01:00:55.939 --> 01:00:56.629
David Boder: Yes?

01:00:56.629 --> 01:01:08.329
Otto Feuer: But not in the concentration camps. They have been abused by SS men, but not in the concentration camps. I was sure that the SS were influential [??]

01:01:08.329 --> 01:01:09.799
David Boder: What?

01:01:09.799 --> 01:01:15.409
Otto Feuer: . . . there was greater punishment by the SS...it was against...this was against...

01:01:15.409 --> 01:01:16.969
David Boder: This was against the law...

01:01:16.969 --> 01:01:19.369
Otto Feuer: . . . against German racial law...

01:01:19.369 --> 01:01:21.259
David Boder: Oh, it was against the racial laws?

01:01:21.259 --> 01:01:22.489
Otto Feuer: It was against the racial laws?

01:01:22.489 --> 01:01:24.559
David Boder: Promiscuous sex relations?

01:01:24.559 --> 01:01:25.519
Otto Feuer: Of course.

01:01:25.519 --> 01:01:27.559
David Boder: You mean to say, if there were a Jew...

01:01:27.559 --> 01:01:38.659
Otto Feuer: . . . a Jew, a Jew could have been prosecuted in Germany before the war, in 1936 or seven. Before the war there was this law of Rassenshande.

01:01:38.659 --> 01:01:42.649
David Boder: Yes. But didn’t that mean that they should not have children?

01:01:42.649 --> 01:01:58.069
Otto Feuer: No, no...that was even sexual intercourse between a Jew and a prostitute. He was...he was condemned to...to prison...to...two years, three years even when having sexual intercourse with a prostitute...

01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:59.299
David Boder: With an Aryan prostitute...

01:01:59.299 --> 01:02:12.229
Otto Feuer: With an Aryan prostitute. And even German have been prosecuted, and have been prosecuted because having intercourse with a Jewish, with a Jewish girl...

01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:20.629
David Boder: Yes. Were then the Polish women and the others differently treated? They say they had the brothels for the officers?

01:02:20.629 --> 01:02:24.109
Otto Feuer: [several words not clear] Of course the had brothels for the officers.

01:02:24.109 --> 01:02:25.129
David Boder: And who were they?

01:02:25.129 --> 01:02:31.099
Otto Feuer: It was no Jewish women. Women of all nations but no Jewish women.

01:02:31.099 --> 01:02:32.059
David Boder: Deportees?

01:02:32.059 --> 01:02:32.899
Otto Feuer: Yes.

01:02:32.899 --> 01:02:33.979
David Boder: women deportees.

01:02:33.979 --> 01:02:35.269
Otto Feuer: Deportees too...

01:02:35.269 --> 01:02:39.589
David Boder: What did the tell about the brothel in Buchenwald?

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:54.649
Otto Feuer: This brothel in Buchenwald, in Buchenwald was created in autumn ’43 some words sound like Germanic Club, or one o’clock and at the assembly, after an Appell at two o’clock or about one o’clock...

01:02:54.649 --> 01:02:55.729
David Boder: Nun?

01:02:55.729 --> 01:03:08.269
Otto Feuer: Nun at one o’clock, and the SS commander of the camp declared to the prisoners, the brothel is open and the prisoners can begin “their work” - “can begin their work, ja” [??]

01:03:08.269 --> 01:03:09.589
David Boder: Can begin - you mean...

01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:10.189
Otto Feuer: . . . “their work”

01:03:10.189 --> 01:03:11.839
David Boder: Under what conditions?

01:03:11.839 --> 01:03:13.999
Otto Feuer: It was only for Germans...

01:03:13.999 --> 01:03:14.689
David Boder: Yes.

01:03:14.689 --> 01:03:23.659
Otto Feuer: There were sixteen women at that time in the brothel. So he had to make an application to the Blockälteste.

01:03:23.659 --> 01:03:25.279
David Boder: Who had to make an application?

01:03:25.279 --> 01:03:34.249
Otto Feuer: The prisoners. The interested person...an application to the Blockälteste, who forwarded it to the Aberstatistik.

01:03:34.249 --> 01:03:34.939
David Boder: Yes.

01:03:34.939 --> 01:03:46.249
Otto Feuer: And then he got an invitation from the Aberstatistik [?] some day later to show up in the hospital in the [word not clear] where he passed a medical visit.

01:03:46.249 --> 01:03:47.359
David Boder: Yes, examination...

01:03:47.359 --> 01:04:00.379
Otto Feuer: Exaination, and then he got a clear [?] ticket to go to the brothel where he had to pasy one mark. We got in Buchenwald Lagermark -

01:04:00.379 --> 01:04:02.929
David Boder: Yes, that was...yes...

01:04:02.929 --> 01:04:13.579
Otto Feuer: And he had to pay for it, and then he could use a woman, he couldn’t [?] have his choice, his choice...when the woman was too weak...

01:04:13.579 --> 01:04:14.899
David Boder: Yes.

01:04:14.899 --> 01:04:23.239
Otto Feuer: And at any rate...he would have to take another woman, and of course that meant [here apparently the interview was interrupted for some reason possibly by some co-worker of Mr. Feuer]

01:04:23.239 --> 01:04:26.869
David Boder: Well you said he could go over and then...

01:04:26.869 --> 01:04:39.889
Otto Feuer: He then, of course the SS man, one SS man was on duty of the brothel, and he took care that nobody stay too long with his girl there. There was a recognized [word not clear]

01:04:39.889 --> 01:04:41.929
David Boder: Yes.

01:04:41.929 --> 01:04:51.529
Otto Feuer: Of course most of the political prisoners tried not with complete success, but at any rate tried to boycott the brothel.

01:04:51.529 --> 01:04:53.539
David Boder: Yes, who were the women.

01:04:53.539 --> 01:04:58.099
Otto Feuer: The women, the women, were deportees of the...of a women’s concentration camp.

01:04:58.099 --> 01:04:58.699
David Boder: Yes.

01:04:58.699 --> 01:05:02.479
Otto Feuer: . . . who have been asked to volunteer for it.

01:05:02.479 --> 01:05:03.859
David Boder: They volunteered. What were they given in exchange?

01:05:03.859 --> 01:05:07.879
Otto Feuer: They were given - they had not to work.

01:05:07.879 --> 01:05:10.039
David Boder: Not to work. Were they given better food?

01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:15.229
Otto Feuer: They got better food. Yes. They got the same food...they got the same food as the SS.

01:05:15.229 --> 01:05:19.849
David Boder: Yes. Were the SS also using the same place?

01:05:19.849 --> 01:05:29.029
Otto Feuer: There was one [word not clear] Lagerführer Gust who was in this place always in this place and who had a sweetheart in this place, a very interesting story with this sweetheart.

01:05:29.029 --> 01:05:30.109
David Boder: Yes.

01:05:30.109 --> 01:05:33.499
Otto Feuer: She furnished the camp with a lot of informations.

01:05:33.499 --> 01:05:34.549
David Boder: What kind? [??]

01:05:34.549 --> 01:05:38.899
Otto Feuer: . . . from [?] this girl, which she drew out of the Lagerführer.

01:05:38.899 --> 01:05:46.129
David Boder: Yes. And why...if he was the Lagerführer, how happened it that he couldn’t take her out and keep her for himself.

01:05:46.129 --> 01:05:51.469
Otto Feuer: Because this woman was a deportee and she was assigned to this...to this brothel.

01:05:51.469 --> 01:05:51.919
David Boder: Yes.

01:05:51.919 --> 01:06:02.749
Otto Feuer: So he couldn’t, he couldn’t take her [several words not clear] He was not so much interested. You see he was a perverted man who found an interest to have such a woman.

01:06:02.749 --> 01:06:03.619
David Boder: Yes.

01:06:03.619 --> 01:06:05.839
Otto Feuer: Well the story I wanted to tell you.

01:06:05.839 --> 01:06:06.589
David Boder: Yes.

01:06:06.589 --> 01:06:16.789
Otto Feuer: Of course most of the prisoners who visited the camp [corrects himself] who visited the brothel, who visited...were political...[corrects himself] were criminal prisoners.

01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:18.529
David Boder: Yes.

01:06:18.529 --> 01:06:21.859
Otto Feuer: Well this story went around in the whole camp.

01:06:21.859 --> 01:06:22.549
David Boder: Yes.

01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:31.729
Otto Feuer: Starting with the beginning of the autumn of ’43 we have got the permission to receive packages...food packages...

01:06:31.729 --> 01:06:32.299
David Boder: Yes.

01:06:32.299 --> 01:06:34.609
Otto Feuer: And those German criminal prisoners...

01:06:34.609 --> 01:06:34.849
David Boder: Yes.

01:06:34.849 --> 01:06:42.799
Otto Feuer: [word not clear] From relatives, - and of course had some relatives in Germany, and they got food packages. Now one of this prisoners has got a cookie.

01:06:42.799 --> 01:06:43.909
David Boder: A what?

01:06:43.909 --> 01:06:44.809
Otto Feuer: A cookie...

01:06:44.809 --> 01:06:47.569
David Boder: Yes...a cake...

01:06:47.569 --> 01:07:01.129
Otto Feuer: A cake, and of course everybody of those who frequented the brothel wanted to bring something special to his “sweetheart’ to have some nice minutes.

01:07:01.129 --> 01:07:01.909
David Boder: Yes.

01:07:01.909 --> 01:07:05.359
Otto Feuer: And he brought this cake.

01:07:05.359 --> 01:07:05.689
David Boder: Yes.

01:07:05.689 --> 01:07:45.334
Otto Feuer: [several words not clear] He made his application, and [several words not clear] he went to the brothel, and he brought this cake to this woman. After having finished, he came back to us. It was Sunday and nobody worked, and he came back to his barracks[??] and sat down at this table. And then...he was doing nothing, and about a half an hour later one of his comrades entered the [word not clear] block, seated himself at the same desk, and he had a little parcel and he began to take out this parcel and it was this cake.

01:07:45.334 --> 01:07:46.234
David Boder: Yes.

01:07:46.234 --> 01:07:50.314
Otto Feuer: Which one of the [word not clear] criminals has brought to the woman.

01:07:50.314 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: Yes.

00:00:00.000 --> 01:08:00.874
Otto Feuer: [repeats the same, not clear word as in the previous sentence, sounds like was] which she has given to the other comrade. He was now...the prisoner could now see how this comrade was eating cookie...[several words not clear]

01:08:00.874 --> 01:08:04.324
David Boder: Yes. Why did she give it away?

01:08:04.324 --> 01:08:08.674
Otto Feuer: [several words not clear] She was in love with this guy.

01:08:08.674 --> 01:08:14.044
David Boder: She was in love with this guy - so she gave him away the cake that the other had brought. Well...

01:08:14.044 --> 01:08:25.084
Otto Feuer: He was [a case of] strictly ignored love. The prisoners who have been for years, and years and years, and of German origninal became...because afterwards so-called Ehrenhäftlings...Literally, “true prisoners.”

01:08:25.084 --> 01:08:25.474
David Boder: Yes.

01:08:25.474 --> 01:08:30.964
Otto Feuer: That means they were entitled to have the hair not cut.

01:08:30.964 --> 01:08:32.074
David Boder: Hum.

01:08:32.074 --> 01:08:39.484
Otto Feuer: And it was strictly forbidden for prisoners to write a words to one of the...

01:08:39.484 --> 01:08:40.714
David Boder: Women?

01:08:40.714 --> 01:08:44.524
Otto Feuer: Well. There were orders that almost [??]...prisoners who have done it...

01:08:44.524 --> 01:08:45.094
David Boder: Yes.

01:08:45.094 --> 01:08:50.104
Otto Feuer: Must be [word not clear] prisoners who haven’t had a woman for seven years, eight years, ten years.

01:08:50.104 --> 01:08:50.674
David Boder: Yes.

01:08:50.674 --> 01:09:00.394
Otto Feuer: And of course it was something for some of them. And some of those prisoners lost their hair. Because they have written a letter to one of those girls.

01:09:00.394 --> 01:09:02.524
David Boder: So they had to shave off their hair?

01:09:02.524 --> 01:09:06.724
Otto Feuer: That is so [??] They got to have the hair cut.

01:09:06.724 --> 01:09:14.374
David Boder: Now tell me this, Mr. Feuer. After you were freed from Buchenwald, where did you go?

01:09:14.374 --> 01:09:18.754
Otto Feuer: After my liberation in Buchenwald, I stayed for about a month in Buchenwald and...

01:09:18.754 --> 01:09:22.234
David Boder: Who took care of you, who was feeding the camp?

01:09:22.234 --> 01:09:29.734
Otto Feuer: It was the American army who...I guess it was also the Russians [?] who made distributions [of prisoners??]

01:09:29.734 --> 01:09:30.934
David Boder: Yes.

01:09:30.934 --> 01:09:32.344
Otto Feuer: We were fed, we were -

01:09:32.344 --> 01:09:37.294
David Boder: Did you go in the Verwaltung, did you go into the management of the camp.

01:09:37.294 --> 01:09:43.654
Otto Feuer: Yes, of course. We had..our administration completely continued to exist.

01:09:43.654 --> 01:09:44.104
David Boder: The -

01:09:44.104 --> 01:10:11.029
Otto Feuer: Only that we were no more governed by the SS. We were completely self governing ourselves, and there were of course American officers who had the final decision about questions, and so on. But all the other things..we made the requisitions ourselves. The American officers gave us a truck. They gave us some people, some soldiers with arms to make requisitions, and gave us the authorization to requisition.

01:10:11.029 --> 01:10:13.369
David Boder: Oh, you mean you made [word not clear] requisitions from the Germans?

01:10:13.369 --> 01:10:14.569
Otto Feuer: From the Germans. Yes.

01:10:14.569 --> 01:10:18.079
David Boder: Did the Germans have enough to feed such a camp.

01:10:18.079 --> 01:10:23.359
Otto Feuer: Some of it...how have we been fed formerly.

01:10:23.359 --> 01:10:23.629
David Boder: Yes.

01:10:23.629 --> 01:10:33.349
Otto Feuer: Of course we were fed by Germans too. The un...[apparently he wanted to say UNNRA] the American army contributed something, but the basic food was German food.

01:10:33.349 --> 01:10:36.379
David Boder: Did you regain your freedom, could you start to go out?

01:10:36.379 --> 01:10:48.379
Otto Feuer: Yes we went...we could not...just not completely. We could get a paper, authorizing us to leave the camp, for one day.

01:10:48.379 --> 01:10:48.859
David Boder: Yes.

01:10:48.859 --> 01:10:49.939
Otto Feuer: To have a furlough.

01:10:49.939 --> 01:10:50.179
David Boder: Yes.

01:10:50.179 --> 01:10:51.019
Otto Feuer: For one day.

01:10:51.019 --> 01:10:51.409
David Boder: Yes.

01:10:51.409 --> 01:11:08.359
Otto Feuer: And we had to come back. Because it was no more so strict, and we could leave the camp. Of course we have cut, we have cut the barbed wire and so on, and we left the camp very often [?] And we didn’t leave the camp, most of us, 99% of us came back because nobody knew where to go.

01:11:08.359 --> 01:11:10.579
David Boder: And the war was still going on.

01:11:10.579 --> 01:11:13.369
Otto Feuer: The war was still going on, and so on.

01:11:13.369 --> 01:11:16.459
David Boder: Did you have your radios and could you listen to...

01:11:16.459 --> 01:11:20.989
Otto Feuer: Yes. We all, we all...we had it formal. Now we could of course -

01:11:20.989 --> 01:11:21.589
David Boder: Yes.

01:11:21.589 --> 01:11:30.829
Otto Feuer: No more listen to the Germans [several words not clear] they broadcasted, we listened to it. Officially to...Landsman [?] to Luxembourg.

01:11:30.829 --> 01:11:39.709
David Boder: Aha. Tell me this. Were the stores of clothes...[??] of so long. Could you get that back then?

01:11:39.709 --> 01:11:49.879
Otto Feuer: Yes. Yes we could now...even we requisitioned two...army clothes and so on...army stock was requisitioned.

01:11:49.879 --> 01:11:50.359
David Boder: Yes.

01:11:50.359 --> 01:11:51.559
Otto Feuer: And was given to us.

01:11:51.559 --> 01:11:52.909
David Boder: German army stuff?

01:11:52.909 --> 01:12:02.059
Otto Feuer: German army stuff. And even other vital clothes, baby clothes was requisitioned by...by the American army, and was given to us.

01:12:02.059 --> 01:12:04.129
David Boder: Requisitioned from whom?

01:12:04.129 --> 01:12:06.109
Otto Feuer: From the Germans.

01:12:06.109 --> 01:12:08.809
David Boder: You mean from the families requisitioned.

01:12:08.809 --> 01:12:11.299
Otto Feuer: No, no, no, no, no, no...from German stores.

01:12:11.299 --> 01:12:12.319
David Boder: Yes.

01:12:12.319 --> 01:12:14.959
Otto Feuer: From German stores. There were still German stores.

01:12:14.959 --> 01:12:15.619
David Boder: Yes.

01:12:15.619 --> 01:12:26.329
Otto Feuer: [enumerates, not clear] ordinary...shoes, and then suits too, and pullovers, and so on...

01:12:26.329 --> 01:12:33.889
David Boder: [word not clear] then you got more or less clothes, and so on...and then, when did you go away to France...eh, to France?

01:12:33.889 --> 01:13:09.650
Otto Feuer: Now...after the liberation there came a lot of Americans, American army personalities and then were such [word not clear] and press men, and so on, who came to visit the camp, and I guided most of these people through the camp. When guiding one of the American officers through a camp, a certain lieutenant Letva [??] [several words not clear] he was very impressed about...the story. He told me, he had been in the States, he had been an isolationist.

01:13:09.650 --> 01:13:10.190
David Boder: Yes.

01:13:10.190 --> 01:13:18.230
Otto Feuer: And now, after having seen Buchenwald, he now knew, why it was good that he was...

01:13:18.230 --> 01:13:19.190
David Boder: . . . came here.

01:13:19.190 --> 01:13:21.650
Otto Feuer: That America Has made [was in] this war.

01:13:21.650 --> 01:13:23.390
David Boder: Yes.

01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:46.310
Otto Feuer: Well, this man this officer was very fond of me, and he offered me to accompany him. And I had nobody, I had nowhere to go, so I went with him and we turned into the vicinity of the little town of Germany of Wetzlar. [next sentence not clear] He had to leave for Marseilles [several words not clear] I stayed with him about one month.

01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:48.290
David Boder: What did you do with him?

01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:52.340
Otto Feuer: I was doing nothing at that time. I was eating very well.

01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:52.970
David Boder: Ja.

01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:55.100
Otto Feuer: And I was helping a little bit in the kitchen.

01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:56.390
David Boder: Ja.

01:13:56.390 --> 01:14:08.180
Otto Feuer: Then he recommended me to the American Military government it Wetzlar and I was working there...from May 22nd on to August 15th.

01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:09.470
David Boder: Yes.

01:14:09.470 --> 01:14:25.970
Otto Feuer: Then I created in the city of Wetzlar a committee [for people] for persons who have left...been in concetration camps, and I was beginning to work for a new German newspaper, the Frankfurter Rundschau.

01:14:25.970 --> 01:14:29.240
David Boder: Hum.

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:38.060
Otto Feuer: I earned [?] a very good living. I had a very interesting job, and I had a car, I had a very fine apartment and so on, but I could no more see the Germans...

01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:43.580
David Boder: The Frankfurter Rundschau could supply you with that kind of facilities, with a car?

01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:50.420
Otto Feuer: I was working [?] for the Frankfurter Rundschau in combine with this work that I was doing for the Military government and for this committee.

01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:50.570
David Boder: Yes.

01:14:50.570 --> 01:14:52.100
Otto Feuer: I had a car.

01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:52.880

Otto Feuer: Yes I drive, drove myself.

01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:55.340
David Boder: Yes.

01:14:55.340 --> 01:15:03.680
Otto Feuer: I drove myself, I was still living in that little town of Wetzlar. Wetzlar is a very famous town because these Leitz Werke you know, Leitz...

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:06.410
David Boder: Leitz? The optical...

01:15:06.410 --> 01:15:09.350
Otto Feuer: Yes the optical works of Leitz around there...

01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:11.180
David Boder: Ja.

01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:20.120
Otto Feuer: I made a very good living, but I could no more be with the Germans. I don’t I couldn’t...I do not, I won’t tell really that I hate the, but I detest them [several words not clear]

01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:20.990
David Boder: [not clear]

01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:45.470
Otto Feuer: The came to me and they were telling me - the knew that I was a Jew of course - and then they came me, to tell me how good they had treated the Jews. In person each German came to me, tell...told me how good he had been to [word not clear] Jews....one...one German gendarme, a Land [part of word not clear] [obviously meaning village constable] came to tell me that when there was the order to...bring all those Jews to the assembly center...

01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:46.190
David Boder: Yes.

01:15:46.190 --> 01:15:51.260
Otto Feuer: He did not bring them on foot but he brought them with a cart.

01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:51.590
David Boder: Hum.

01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:56.660
Otto Feuer: And this was an example of humanity [humane-ity] towards the Jews.

01:15:56.660 --> 01:15:57.470
David Boder: Yes.

01:15:57.470 --> 01:16:24.665
Otto Feuer: Well, it...it...it’s...I don’t seem to...anybody will...will understand...it...our general feeling, why those Jews...why I every...most of the other Jews won’t stay in Germany...Won’t stay in Poland, that’s we can no more see these people, it’s too much for our memory, for our [word not clear] it’s too much.

01:16:24.665 --> 01:16:25.955
David Boder: Hum.

01:16:25.955 --> 01:16:29.225
Otto Feuer: So I had an opportunity to go to France...

01:16:29.225 --> 01:16:31.955
David Boder: What was that opportunity, how did that come?

01:16:31.955 --> 01:16:39.065
Otto Feuer: Well there were...some remote relations of mine are living in Paris, and got...a so called...[two words in French not clear, obviously meaning permit for temporary, or transitory visa]

01:16:39.065 --> 01:16:39.365
David Boder: Hum.

01:16:39.365 --> 01:16:42.305
Otto Feuer: And of course my intention to go to the States.

01:16:42.305 --> 01:16:43.175
David Boder: Hum.

01:16:43.175 --> 01:16:55.235
Otto Feuer: . . . to America. I thought that this time it would go much quicker, being in France. So I left Germany on three days’ notice [??]

01:16:55.235 --> 01:16:56.975
David Boder: Who did you meet [??] with?

01:16:56.975 --> 01:17:09.935
Otto Feuer: This...my...my...where I was working and so on. And I gave back the car and so on, and I took a truck from UNNRA and came to France, came to Paris.

01:17:09.935 --> 01:17:11.825
David Boder: Did they give you a truck or...?

01:17:11.825 --> 01:17:15.935
Otto Feuer: No, there was a [train? Word not clear] there was a convoy of people, of...a repatriation convoy.

01:17:15.935 --> 01:17:16.475
David Boder: Yes.

01:17:16.475 --> 01:17:18.665
Otto Feuer: And I took part in it.

01:17:18.665 --> 01:17:22.955
David Boder: Aha. And tell me this. When do you think you will be in America?

01:17:22.955 --> 01:17:31.625
Otto Feuer: In just learned...five minutes ago I learned, wouldn’t be there before...either the end of this year or the beginning of next year.

01:17:31.625 --> 01:17:32.675
David Boder: Why? What quota have you? Polish?

01:17:32.675 --> 01:17:43.595
Otto Feuer: Austrian quota. And I have already registered 10 years [ago?] and I would already been in the States, nearly...nearly I’d been in the States...

01:17:43.595 --> 01:17:44.495
David Boder: In ’39?

01:17:44.495 --> 01:18:06.816
Otto Feuer: In ’39 or ’40. But in ’40 I couldn’t get visa. When I already was in concentration camp, I had still the photo-copy of the letter which the American consulate of Hamburg wrote me at that time, that he couldn’t yet grant me the visa; my...my uncle who had sent me the affidavit had to send them out...

01:18:06.816 --> 01:18:07.656
David Boder: A paper...[?]

01:18:07.656 --> 01:18:11.496
Otto Feuer: Another paper of the bank otherwise...

01:18:11.496 --> 01:18:13.116
David Boder: A statement of the bank.

01:18:13.116 --> 01:18:21.906
Otto Feuer: . . . a statement of the bank, otherwise it would not be sufficiently sure how much my livelihood would be secure in the - States.

01:18:21.906 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: Where is your uncle?

00:00:00.000 --> 01:18:27.966
Otto Feuer: He is in the States [??] But now...now I have two brothers in the States. I am going to my brothers.

01:18:27.966 --> 01:18:29.586
David Boder: Where are your two brothers?

01:18:29.586 --> 01:18:33.426
Otto Feuer: One of my brothers is in Erie, in Pennsylvania.

01:18:33.426 --> 01:18:33.996

01:18:39.996 --> 01:18:41.016
Otto Feuer: Yes.

01:18:41.016 --> 01:18:41.316
David Boder: And the other?

01:18:41.316 --> 01:18:44.586
Otto Feuer: The other one is in Gary, 320...

01:18:44.586 --> 01:18:45.606
David Boder: Gary, Indiana?

01:18:45.606 --> 01:18:45.876
Otto Feuer: Yes.

01:18:45.876 --> 01:18:49.296
David Boder: Well that’s near to me. You want me to call him up?

01:18:49.296 --> 01:18:50.646
Otto Feuer: Of course I want you to call him up.

01:18:50.646 --> 01:18:51.846
David Boder: Sure.

01:18:51.846 --> 01:18:57.426
Otto Feuer: Three hundred twenty two...Oh really? He might listen to this.

01:18:57.426 --> 01:18:57.636
David Boder: Yes.

01:18:57.636 --> 01:18:58.656
Otto Feuer: He might hear this?

01:18:58.656 --> 01:18:58.926
David Boder: Yes.

01:18:58.926 --> 01:19:10.056
Otto Feuer: [In ecstasy] Tell him, he is a little bit ill [??]...tell him I love him very much, and tell him he shall...he shall...here, here [he apparently points to a part of the body] sick, you know, I want him to be, I want him to be healthy...

01:19:10.056 --> 01:19:13.176
David Boder: [Both are talking] Is he married?

01:19:13.176 --> 01:19:16.296
Otto Feuer: He is married, he has two children. I did not yet see the children.

01:19:16.296 --> 01:19:18.306
David Boder: You know what I promise you to do?

01:19:18.306 --> 01:19:19.146
Otto Feuer: Ja.

01:19:19.146 --> 01:19:22.476
David Boder: I take this machine into my car.

01:19:22.476 --> 01:19:22.986
Otto Feuer: Ja.

David Boder: And I drive out to Gary and [word not clear] [interviewer is apparently deeply moved]

Otto Feuer: Oh that would be wonderful. Tuen sie es for sure. verstanden, gut, and Lucy, Doris and Peter this is Onkel Otto. You do not yet know me, but once you will know me.

01:19:41.106 --> 01:19:47.856
Otto Feuer: I give you the address: 322 Gary, Ind. Honduras [??] Street [repetition not clear]

01:19:47.856 --> 01:20:18.181
David Boder: Vanburen Street? [spool is apparently at an end] All right that concludes the interview with Mr. Feuer. It is the continuation of Spool...Spool 64, it was very informal, especially, to give the interviewer a general picture, and Mr. Feuer was very helpful in getting other interviewees. I hope he will be there soon but I think I will call up...[blank on the wire] in Gary and we will have a good time together. I let them listen to this...
