00:01:20.732 --> 00:01:41.969
Bella Zgnilek: In the beginni-...in the beginning, when the Germans came in—it was maybe two months after—my brother was out [word not clear] in the town [at] five minutes past seven, and the law was that we had to be on the street only till seven o’clock. The Germans picked him up and then shot him in the night.

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:42.651
David Boder: Your brother?

00:01:42.651 --> 00:01:43.211
Bella Zgnilek: My brother.

00:01:43.211 --> 00:01:45.049
David Boder: What for did they shoot him?

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:52.455
Bella Zgnilek: Because he...there was a law that they have to be...people have to be only on the street till si-...till seven o’clock.

00:01:52.455 --> 00:01:54.901
David Boder: So it was for infringement of curfew.

00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:55.522
Bella Zgnilek: Yes.

00:01:55.522 --> 00:02:00.798

00:02:17.222 --> 00:02:20.794

00:02:25.096 --> 00:02:27.421

Bella Zgnilek: A younger brother, two years older than me.

00:02:30.354 --> 00:02:32.253

00:02:56.058 --> 00:02:59.539
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:08.953
Bella Zgnilek: Oh, after a while, it was a...the German picked up all the Jews on one big place, and they made a segregation.

00:03:08.953 --> 00:03:10.578
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:10.578 --> 00:03:19.292
Bella Zgnilek: And young people they sent to concentration camp, and older people...[correction, pertaining to the young people] to working camps, and older people to Auschwitz.

00:03:19.292 --> 00:03:28.036
David Boder: Yes. Tell me, how was that? How did they announce that all the Jews should come together? Was that what they called Aussiedlung [expulsion, deportation]?

00:03:28.036 --> 00:03:29.022
Bella Zgnilek: That’s right.

00:03:29.022 --> 00:03:29.278
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:29.278 --> 00:03:42.951
Bella Zgnilek: Then they issued an order that all the Jews assemble [?] in one place, and one day there [?] was the segregation. They took the young people to different camps, working camps, older people to Aussiedlung.

00:03:42.951 --> 00:03:44.150
David Boder: To Auschwitz.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.075
Bella Zgnilek: To Auschwitz.

00:03:45.075 --> 00:03:47.278
David Boder: And what happened to those other people?

00:03:47.278 --> 00:03:51.915
Bella Zgnilek: What happened to them? They were sent to gas and killed.

00:03:51.915 --> 00:03:54.027
David Boder: How did you know that?

00:03:54.027 --> 00:03:58.755
Bella Zgnilek: Because when I have been in the camp, I have been working there at the beginning...

00:03:58.755 --> 00:03:59.041
David Boder: Yes?

00:03:59.041 --> 00:04:16.885
Bella Zgnilek: . . . after they sent us into a concentration camp. There were the SS women and a terrible [word not clear], but before, when we were in working camp, there came some girls, young girls, from Auschwitz also for work, and they told us everything.

00:04:16.885 --> 00:04:18.905
David Boder: What did they tell you?

00:04:18.905 --> 00:04:35.986
Bella Zgnilek: That they pick up people just from the train, because there are too many to send them to camp. So they pick them just from the train and send them to gas. They didn’t tell them that they are sending to kill, but to the bath.

00:04:35.986 --> 00:04:37.976
David Boder: Yes, to a bath. And then?

00:04:37.976 --> 00:04:45.899
Bella Zgnilek: To a bath. And then they closed...shut all the doors, and they gassed them.

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:47.615
David Boder: Yes. And then?

00:04:47.615 --> 00:04:49.027
Bella Zgnilek: And then?

00:04:49.027 --> 00:04:50.530
David Boder: They...

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.676
Bella Zgnilek: So they killed all the Jews.

00:04:53.676 --> 00:05:06.863
David Boder: Aha. There were only Jews among them. So, when you came together that...that morning to the...to the plaza, so what happened to your family then? Were you separated from your family?

00:05:06.863 --> 00:05:08.031
Bella Zgnilek: Yes.

00:05:08.031 --> 00:05:09.108
David Boder: Who...

00:05:09.108 --> 00:05:20.134
Bella Zgnilek: My sister, my brother-in-law with their [?] child, they were freed for the moment and sent back to the town. My mother was sent to Aussiedlung, and me they took to [the] working camp.

00:05:20.134 --> 00:05:23.219
David Boder: Yes. Did you ever hear anything afterwards from your mother?

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:30.016
Bella Zgnilek: No, nothing. And my sister was sent to Aussiedlung, also to Auschwitz, in half a year later.

00:05:30.016 --> 00:05:31.032
David Boder: Half a year later.

00:05:31.032 --> 00:05:31.470
Bella Zgnilek: Yes.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.829
David Boder: Well, she was with your brother and their child. What happened...

00:05:34.829 --> 00:05:38.066
Bella Zgnilek: My brother was sent also to the concentration camp before.

00:05:38.066 --> 00:05:38.839
David Boder: Yes?

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:50.017
Bella Zgnilek: Before me. To a working camp. And I was sent later, after, together with my mother. But my mother to Auschwitz, and me to a camp. And my sister was for the moment free.

00:05:50.017 --> 00:05:53.102
David Boder: All right. Now what do you know? What happened to your brother?

00:05:53.102 --> 00:05:54.575
Bella Zgnilek: I don’t know anything.

00:05:54.575 --> 00:05:57.265

00:05:57.265 --> 00:05:58.281
Bella Zgnilek: I don’t know.

00:05:58.281 --> 00:06:00.910
David Boder: You don’t know. Did you try to find them?

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:08.620
Bella Zgnilek: Oh, yes. I was in different committees and gave the name of [words not clear].

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.732
David Boder: Yes. But they are not...

00:06:10.732 --> 00:06:13.452
Bella Zgnilek: I didn’t get any news from anybody of them.

00:06:13.452 --> 00:06:21.953
David Boder: All right. [Pause.] Now, and you were there.

00:06:21.953 --> 00:06:25.099
Bella Zgnilek: Grossrosen outside detail.

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:27.880

00:06:59.561 --> 00:07:00.182

00:08:18.025 --> 00:08:19.680
Bella Zgnilek: They counted all of us.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.731

00:08:21.731 --> 00:08:24.451
Bella Zgnilek: It never was in our camp.

00:08:24.451 --> 00:08:25.528
David Boder: Why?

00:08:25.528 --> 00:08:31.078

00:08:31.078 --> 00:08:32.064
David Boder: Oh! They would kill other girls?

00:08:32.064 --> 00:08:32.989

00:08:32.989 --> 00:08:34.614
David Boder: Did that happen?

00:08:34.614 --> 00:08:36.604
Bella Zgnilek: In different camps, yes.

00:08:36.604 --> 00:08:37.590
David Boder: But not in yours.

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:40.341
Bella Zgnilek: No, because everybody has been in the camp.

00:08:40.341 --> 00:08:48.081
David Boder: Aha. All right. And then, after the Zaehlappell, would they give you something to eat?

00:08:48.081 --> 00:08:53.174

00:08:55.012 --> 00:08:56.789
Bella Zgnilek: They brought some soup to the factory.

00:08:56.789 --> 00:09:00.331

00:09:02.138 --> 00:09:03.671
David Boder: And they would give you something...

00:09:03.671 --> 00:09:10.438
Bella Zgnilek: It was different. Sometimes when the director was in a good mood, he stopped. If not, we had to eat and work.

00:09:10.438 --> 00:09:14.771
David Boder: Aha. Yes. And what were you working...what [kind of] factory was it?

00:09:34.335 --> 00:09:36.112
Bella Zgnilek: For uniforms.

00:09:36.112 --> 00:09:36.824
David Boder: For uniforms.

00:09:36.824 --> 00:09:37.323
Bella Zgnilek: For soldier uniforms.

00:09:37.323 --> 00:09:42.781
David Boder: All right. Then, how late would you work?

00:09:42.781 --> 00:09:44.162
Bella Zgnilek: Twelve hours.

00:09:44.162 --> 00:09:45.270
David Boder: Yes?

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:46.773
Bella Zgnilek: And after, fourteen hours.

00:09:46.773 --> 00:09:47.881
David Boder: Fourteen hours a day.

00:09:47.881 --> 00:09:48.258
Bella Zgnilek: Yes.

00:09:48.258 --> 00:09:50.704
David Boder: Would they bring you something to eat in between?

00:09:50.704 --> 00:09:52.694
Bella Zgnilek: Twelve o’clock again soup.

00:09:52.694 --> 00:09:53.741
David Boder: Yes?

00:09:53.741 --> 00:09:56.157
Bella Zgnilek: And that was all.

00:09:56.157 --> 00:09:56.443
David Boder: Yes.

00:09:56.443 --> 00:10:02.388
Bella Zgnilek: But weekly we got some bread and some margarine.

00:10:02.388 --> 00:10:09.581
David Boder: Some margarine. Now tell me this. What were you eating your soup with? Did you have your plates? Did you have your spoons?

00:10:09.581 --> 00:10:14.340
Bella Zgnilek: Oh, we got just a plate and a spoon, yes.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:18.034
David Boder: They gave it to you, or you had your own? What was it?

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:21.636
Bella Zgnilek: It was in the beginning that we got it from home.

00:10:21.636 --> 00:10:22.318
David Boder: Aha.

00:10:22.318 --> 00:10:27.320
Bella Zgnilek: And they didn’t take it away from us. But they took away all our clothes.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.367
David Boder: They took away your clothes.

00:10:28.367 --> 00:10:29.201
Bella Zgnilek: Yes.

00:10:29.201 --> 00:10:32.043
David Boder: And what did they do with your clothes?

00:10:32.043 --> 00:10:38.505
Bella Zgnilek: We had it from home brought. When we came to the camp we brought with us [our] clothes. But they took it away from us.

00:10:38.505 --> 00:10:40.160
David Boder: Aha. All right.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.785
Bella Zgnilek: They left us only two things.

00:10:41.785 --> 00:10:50.734
David Boder: Yes? All right. You were through with work at what time in the evening?

00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:52.480
Bella Zgnilek: It depends on the shift.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.009
David Boder: Yes.

00:10:53.009 --> 00:10:56.581
Bella Zgnilek: Sometimes twelve o’clock at night, sometimes four o’clock in the afternoon.

00:10:56.581 --> 00:10:58.084
David Boder: You were in the morning shift?

00:10:58.084 --> 00:11:01.778
Bella Zgnilek: Different. One week in one...

00:11:01.778 --> 00:11:02.990
David Boder: The other week in the other.

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:03.683
Bella Zgnilek: Other.

00:11:03.683 --> 00:11:07.885
David Boder: All right. So at four o’clock when you were through with your shift, what would you do then?

00:11:07.885 --> 00:11:12.911
Bella Zgnilek: Oh, then we had other work. We had to dig [?] potatoes. We had to do...

00:11:12.911 --> 00:11:13.604
David Boder: In the field?

00:11:13.604 --> 00:11:14.968
Bella Zgnilek: In the cellar [?]. In the field.

00:11:14.968 --> 00:11:18.102
David Boder: Yes? And?

00:11:18.102 --> 00:11:22.182
Bella Zgnilek: Oh well, we had...and we had to take turns...

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:22.814
David Boder: What is that?

00:11:22.814 --> 00:11:25.460
Bella Zgnilek: It was called du jour. To clean the barracks.

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:31.463
David Boder: To clean the barracks. Yes? And then what time did you...Did you have some books to read?

00:11:31.463 --> 00:11:32.308
Bella Zgnilek: No.

00:11:32.308 --> 00:11:32.757
David Boder: No.

00:11:32.757 --> 00:11:33.663
Bella Zgnilek: We weren’t allowed to.

00:11:33.663 --> 00:11:38.628
David Boder: Were you allowed to get together to talk to each other, to sing?

00:11:38.628 --> 00:12:01.056
Bella Zgnilek: It depends. If the SS Frau was in a very good mood, maybe sometimes yes. But the...I remember once we have been singing in our room, and then the SS Frau, she came to our room, and she said to me, ‘Such noise,’ and she started to [?] strike everybody, so that it never happened again.

00:12:01.056 --> 00:12:04.539
David Boder: What did she strike you with? [Pause.] With the hand?

00:12:04.539 --> 00:12:05.812
Bella Zgnilek: With the hand, yes.

00:12:05.812 --> 00:12:07.451
David Boder: Where, in your face?

00:12:07.451 --> 00:12:08.083
Bella Zgnilek: In [the] face.

00:12:08.083 --> 00:12:14.757
David Boder: Yes. Now tell me this. Do you remember any of the songs that were made in the camp?

00:12:14.757 --> 00:12:16.365
Bella Zgnilek: Yes.

00:12:16.365 --> 00:12:19.042
David Boder: Can you sing a song?

00:12:19.042 --> 00:12:19.355
Bella Zgnilek: Oh,

00:12:19.355 --> 00:12:30.625
David Boder: You can sing in a very low voice. The main thing we want, the words very clear. You understand? The melody does...just go on and try one. We will see how it comes out.

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:35.167
Bella Zgnilek: I’ll just sing a little bit of the end.

00:12:35.167 --> 00:12:35.480
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.877
Bella Zgnilek: This is the end, because before was [words not clear].

00:12:37.877 --> 00:12:48.262
Bella Zgnilek: [Recites in German] Und die Deutschen, die verfluchten Schweine, / die bekommen noch von uns gebroch’ne Beine. / Und wir müssen selber sehn, / wie alle Deutschen schnell kaputt gehen.

00:12:48.262 --> 00:12:51.557
David Boder: [In English] Well, why don’t you want to sing the first part?

00:12:51.557 --> 00:12:53.376
Bella Zgnilek: Oh. [Words not clear] too much.

00:12:53.376 --> 00:13:07.719
David Boder: Well, go ahead. Do it. Perhaps you can do it now. We want to preserve that material. We don’t want that material lost. It is very important that we preserve that material. Start the first part. Just hum a little bit with the words. Go ahead.

00:13:07.719 --> 00:13:20.782
Bella Zgnilek: [In German] Vor den Baracken in Gabersdorf / steht ein Gitter um den Hof / und die Mädels traurig wissen, / draußen tut die Freiheit glitzen. / Ade Sudentenland!

00:13:20.782 --> 00:13:38.174
David Boder: [In English] Bella will now recite the first and last verse of a poem that she has written in camp. The rest she will give me later in typed form, and we can preserve it together with the record. Go ahead.

00:13:38.174 --> 00:14:50.802
Bella Zgnilek: [In Polish] Moje Miasto: [Tylko niektóre zdania są wyrażne]...piękny, majowy...płacze bolesne...pociąg...tam moji drodzy zostali...a miasto...oderwali...piękny, majowy...już przemineło...i tylko po nocach...to miasto mi się śni...

00:14:50.802 --> 00:15:02.139
David Boder: [In English] Well, that was very good. Bella, you will give me the whole thing typed out in Polish and then a free English translation. Good? [Footnote: Unfortunately I did not obtain the promised material in written form. I may have left Paris without seeing her again. —D.P.B.]

00:15:02.139 --> 00:15:02.723
Bella Zgnilek: All right.

00:15:02.723 --> 00:15:11.892
David Boder: All right. Now tell me what happened then after the...you were through with...when you...from the factory work I understand you were transferred to office work.

00:15:11.892 --> 00:15:12.627
Bella Zgnilek: Yes.

00:15:12.627 --> 00:15:15.290
David Boder: Now tell how things were going there.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:34.429
Bella Zgnilek: Well, it was quite simple. It only was the good point that I didn’t work so very hard, because the work in the factory was terrible and unhealthy. Most of the girls...they got ill, because it was dusty.

00:15:34.429 --> 00:15:42.825
David Boder: All right. Now, in the office. Who were your chiefs? Who was over you? How were you working there? Were you working with Germans together?

00:15:42.825 --> 00:15:49.644
Bella Zgnilek: [I was] not supposed to work with Germans together. And the chief was director of the factory.

00:15:49.644 --> 00:15:54.084
David Boder: Yes? Well, how did they treat you?

00:15:54.084 --> 00:16:04.217
Bella Zgnilek: The Germans in the factory when I walked [?] through—all was quite indifferent to them if I am going through or not.

00:16:04.217 --> 00:16:05.163
David Boder: Yes.

00:16:05.163 --> 00:16:08.759
Bella Zgnilek: But most mistreated [?] we have been by the SS women.

00:16:08.759 --> 00:16:09.886
David Boder: What? By the SS women.

00:16:09.886 --> 00:16:11.103
Bella Zgnilek: SS women.

00:16:11.103 --> 00:16:15.844
David Boder: Yes? What were they doing there?

00:16:15.844 --> 00:16:19.952
Bella Zgnilek: Striking for nothing, shaving our hair.

00:16:19.952 --> 00:16:26.621
David Boder: Did they have your’s shaved off?

00:16:26.621 --> 00:16:30.488
Bella Zgnilek: [Pause.] Not quite, but I had shaved [cut] the hair very short.

00:16:30.488 --> 00:16:43.061
David Boder: Aha. [Aside] she has now a nice head of black hair. All right. Nun...And how long did you work there, in the office?

00:16:43.061 --> 00:16:44.489
Bella Zgnilek: Two years.

00:16:44.489 --> 00:16:46.820
David Boder: You worked for two years there in the office.

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:47.977
Bella Zgnilek: That’s right.

00:16:47.977 --> 00:16:51.272
David Boder: Were you well all the time?

00:16:51.272 --> 00:16:59.055
Bella Zgnilek: Yes. If I wouldn’t have been working in the office maybe I wouldn’t be alive any more, because the factory work would be too difficult for me.

00:16:59.055 --> 00:17:02.320
David Boder: Yes. Did they pay anything for the work?

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.928
Bella Zgnilek: Nothing.

00:17:03.928 --> 00:17:09.091
David Boder: Well, when you needed some things, soap, or...did you have toothpaste?

00:17:09.091 --> 00:17:18.651
Bella Zgnilek: Oh, we didn’t get anything from them. Just one little piece of soap, and we had to wash ourselves only with water.

00:17:18.651 --> 00:17:21.464
David Boder: You washed yourself only with water.

00:17:21.464 --> 00:17:27.078
Bella Zgnilek: And...Oh yes, we got one piece of soap, but that wasn’t enough for the whole month.

00:17:27.078 --> 00:17:36.096
David Boder: Aha. And how did you handle you laundry? Or did you wash your clothing?

00:17:36.096 --> 00:17:39.572
Bella Zgnilek: [Giggles.] Everybody knows that in camp [it] wasn’t so clean.

00:17:39.572 --> 00:17:46.391
David Boder: The camp wasn’t so clean. Did you have any insects there?

00:17:46.391 --> 00:17:47.608
Bella Zgnilek: Hm.

00:17:47.608 --> 00:17:57.030
David Boder: No? How did they manage...if the camp wasn’t so clean, how did they manage to keep the insects away? Did you have lice?

00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:08.954
Bella Zgnilek: It was some. We haven’t been too many in one camp, so it wasn’t...we haven’t had so many lice as in camps where it was overcrowded. There was epidemic, too.

00:18:08.954 --> 00:18:14.960
David Boder: Yes. Now tell me, so after the two years working in the office, what happened then?

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:23.587
Bella Zgnilek: I worked in the office till the liberation. Then came the Russians. They liberated us, and we were free.

00:18:23.587 --> 00:18:26.159
David Boder: Oh! You worked until the liberation?

00:18:26.159 --> 00:18:26.773
Bella Zgnilek: Yes.

00:18:26.773 --> 00:18:36.224
David Boder: And then...and you were freed. Tell me, how did you get to France?

00:18:36.224 --> 00:18:41.838
Bella Zgnilek: We have been seven girls together...

00:18:41.838 --> 00:18:42.332
David Boder: Yes.

00:18:42.332 --> 00:18:48.760
Bella Zgnilek: in camp. And we decided to come to France. We wanted to go to Palestine.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:49.706
David Boder: Yes.

00:18:49.706 --> 00:18:54.326
Bella Zgnilek: So we decided to come to France before, to get transportation.

00:18:54.326 --> 00:18:56.115
David Boder: Yes.

00:18:56.115 --> 00:19:01.609
Bella Zgnilek: And so we came...we managed to come to France. We tried to pass through the border.

00:19:01.609 --> 00:19:03.368
David Boder: Which border, the Russian?

00:19:03.368 --> 00:19:05.639
Bella Zgnilek: It was the German border.

00:19:05.639 --> 00:19:06.314
David Boder: Yes?

00:19:06.314 --> 00:19:09.459
Bella Zgnilek: The German border, Austrian border, and then the French.

00:19:09.459 --> 00:19:10.194
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:10.194 --> 00:19:12.314
Bella Zgnilek: And we came to French.

00:19:12.314 --> 00:19:17.592
David Boder: You came to France. And how did you pay your passage?

00:19:17.592 --> 00:19:22.363
Bella Zgnilek: Oh, we didn’t pay for anything. We just came together with all people.

00:19:22.363 --> 00:19:23.941
David Boder: Yes? And then?

00:19:23.941 --> 00:19:24.917
Bella Zgnilek: Liberated people.

00:19:24.917 --> 00:19:28.845
David Boder: Liberated people were what? Shipped...sent...shipped by the...

00:19:28.845 --> 00:19:31.146
Bella Zgnilek: Sent by the government [word not clear].

00:19:31.146 --> 00:19:35.706
David Boder: By railroad. You said that you wanted to go to France, and you went to France?

00:19:35.706 --> 00:19:39.242
Bella Zgnilek: Yes. It was easy for us.

00:19:39.242 --> 00:19:44.043
David Boder: Did you have to cross the border...what...you came...

00:19:44.043 --> 00:19:47.338
Bella Zgnilek: With...with other French people we came together.

00:19:47.338 --> 00:19:52.574
David Boder: Aha. Nun...and now what do you plan to do?

00:19:52.574 --> 00:20:01.050
Bella Zgnilek: I am waiting for transportation. I have relatives in Canada. I have relatives in Argentina, but it is very difficult for me to get over, because...

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:02.689
David Boder: And [?] why?

00:20:02.689 --> 00:20:08.364
Bella Zgnilek: Because [there is] no transportation. I am twenty-two, and transportation is only for children till sixteen.

00:20:08.364 --> 00:20:11.810
David Boder: Oh! You mean a transporation permit to Argentina?

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:15.738
Bella Zgnilek: Yes. I am not permitted to enter the country.

00:20:15.738 --> 00:20:18.521
David Boder: Argentina? Do you have relatives in Argentina?

00:20:18.521 --> 00:20:20.039
Bella Zgnilek: Right.

00:20:20.039 --> 00:20:23.394
David Boder: You told me you have relatives in Chicago. Who are they?

00:20:23.394 --> 00:20:26.539
Bella Zgnilek: No. It is just a friend, a little girl friend.

00:20:26.539 --> 00:20:28.870
David Boder: Aha. The other girl has her relatives there.

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:29.906
Bella Zgnilek: That’s right.

00:20:29.906 --> 00:20:31.966
David Boder: what is the name of your girl friend?

00:20:31.966 --> 00:20:33.815
Bella Zgnilek: Goldie Birnbaum.

00:20:33.815 --> 00:20:34.761
David Boder: Birnbaum.

00:20:34.761 --> 00:20:35.406
Bella Zgnilek: Right.

00:20:35.406 --> 00:20:36.683
David Boder: Was she with you in camp?

00:20:36.683 --> 00:20:40.912
Bella Zgnilek: No, no, no. She is in the States for...from before the war.

00:20:40.912 --> 00:20:43.304
David Boder: What did you say is her first name?

00:20:43.304 --> 00:20:43.798
Bella Zgnilek: Goldie.

00:20:43.798 --> 00:20:46.973
David Boder: Goldie Birnbaum. Do you know her address?

00:20:46.973 --> 00:20:50.238
Bella Zgnilek: I have it written somewhere, but I have to look for it.

00:20:50.238 --> 00:20:51.605
David Boder: Have you written to her?

00:20:51.605 --> 00:20:52.219
Bella Zgnilek: Yes.

00:20:52.219 --> 00:20:53.135
David Boder: Did she reply?

00:20:53.135 --> 00:20:53.810
Bella Zgnilek: Yes.

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:56.081
David Boder: Did she send you some packages?

00:20:56.081 --> 00:20:56.967
Bella Zgnilek: She did.

00:20:56.967 --> 00:21:01.106
David Boder: Aha. And now you are working here in the office of the Joint?

00:21:01.106 --> 00:21:02.504
Bella Zgnilek: Yes.

00:21:02.504 --> 00:21:14.896
David Boder: And so that is what you are at present doing. All right, Bella, thank you very much. Can you ask your girl friend to come in?

00:21:14.896 --> 00:21:15.480
Bella Zgnilek: I will.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.811
David Boder: Was she with you in the same place all the time?

00:21:17.811 --> 00:21:18.335
Bella Zgnilek: No, no. She hasn’t been in a camp.

00:21:18.335 --> 00:21:20.365
David Boder: No. Where was she?

00:21:20.365 --> 00:21:24.775
Bella Zgnilek: Sorry, I can’t tell you. I don’t know. We know each other since [for] two weeks.

00:21:24.775 --> 00:21:27.317
David Boder: All right. Will you ask her to come in?

00:21:27.317 --> 00:21:28.323
Bella Zgnilek: Yes, I sure will.

00:21:28.323 --> 00:21:59.176
David Boder: Thank you very much. Is there anything...is there anything you want to tell your own people in America from you? [Pause.] The microphone is yours. What do you think shall we tell them about all these...displaced people and deportees?

00:21:59.176 --> 00:22:15.937
Bella Zgnilek: Well, I will just send them regards, and I am happy that not everybody of the Jews went through such a hell [?] as we did. [Pause.]

00:22:15.937 --> 00:22:22.084
David Boder: Bella wants to add a few remarks in Polish. Go ahead, Bella.

00:22:22.084 --> 00:22:52.963
Bella Zgnilek: [In Polish] [unintelligible]

00:22:52.963 --> 00:23:25.335
David Boder: This was a kind of a postscript that I wanted to have, because it’s exceedingly important to have the feelings of these young people. We notice here that she spoke in German, in English, in Polish, and when it came to express her feelings she preferred to express it in Polish. This polyglotism, or multilinguistics if we want to call it that way, represents a psychological and ethnic problem at the same time.
