00:00:02.349 --> 00:00:37.423
David Boder: [In English] France, September the 12th, 1946, at Hénonville, about fifty kilometers from Paris. A Kibbutz in a wonderful countryside, in an old castle, for displaced Jews. The interviewee is Mrs. Clara Neiman, a woman who was converted, I understand, to Judaism. And so, Mrs. Neiman.

00:00:37.423 --> 00:00:41.643
David Boder: [In Russian] tell us again what is your full name and...

00:00:41.643 --> 00:00:42.846
Clara Neiman: Nei—

00:00:42.846 --> 00:00:44.689
David Boder: [Laughingly] Tell us also how old you are.

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:45.626
Clara Neiman: Neiman.

00:00:45.626 --> 00:00:46.126
David Boder: Yes.

00:00:46.126 --> 00:00:47.220
Clara Neiman: Neiman, Clara.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.814
David Boder: Yes.

00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:49.408
Clara Neiman: Twenty-five years.

00:00:49.408 --> 00:00:50.002
David Boder: Twenty-five years.

00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:50.423
Clara Neiman: Yes.

00:00:50.423 --> 00:00:52.314
David Boder: And where were you born Mrs. Neiman?

00:00:52.314 --> 00:00:53.596
Clara Neiman: In the city of Saratov.

00:00:53.596 --> 00:00:55.268
David Boder: So what are you being called by your father’s name [the polite Russian form of addressing people]?

00:00:55.268 --> 00:00:56.627
Clara Neiman: Adamovna [meaning her father’s name was Adam].

00:00:56.627 --> 00:00:57.346
David Boder: Clara Adamova?

00:00:57.346 --> 00:00:57.689
Clara Neiman: Yes.

00:00:57.689 --> 00:01:00.314
David Boder: Clara Adamova, you were born in Saratov?

00:01:00.314 --> 00:01:00.720
Clara Neiman: Yes.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.923
David Boder: And you were a large family.

00:01:02.923 --> 00:01:03.860
Clara Neiman: A large.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.610
David Boder: A large family, yes.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.203
Clara Neiman: Yes.

00:01:05.203 --> 00:01:08.219
David Boder: And how many people? The father, mother...

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:11.407
Clara Neiman: Seven we were. No, no, ten, together with father and mother.

00:01:11.407 --> 00:01:11.907
David Boder: So.

00:01:11.907 --> 00:01:12.922
Clara Neiman: Seven children.

00:01:12.922 --> 00:01:13.797
David Boder: Seven children and...

00:01:13.797 --> 00:01:15.187
Clara Neiman: And father and mother.

00:01:15.187 --> 00:01:16.296
David Boder: Then that makes it nine.

00:01:16.296 --> 00:01:18.748
Clara Neiman: Nine, yes. There was one more who died, and so...

00:01:18.748 --> 00:01:22.074
David Boder: Oh well, altogether your mother had eight children.

00:01:22.074 --> 00:01:23.496
Clara Neiman: Eight [few words not clear].

00:01:23.496 --> 00:01:27.744
David Boder: Now tell me where...well, what was the religion of your parents?

00:01:27.744 --> 00:01:32.273
Clara Neiman: They were Russian [as it often happens, she identifies the Greek Orthodox religion with the Russian nationality]. And then they went over to Judaism.

00:01:32.273 --> 00:01:33.428
David Boder: [With lasting tone of surprise] Your parents, too?

00:01:33.428 --> 00:01:35.630
Clara Neiman: The parents. Afterwards we became Jews.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.067
David Boder: I understand. But your parents, too, had become Jews?

00:01:38.067 --> 00:01:39.208
Clara Neiman: Had become Jews.

00:01:39.208 --> 00:01:40.239
David Boder: How did that happen?

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:44.707
Clara Neiman: [Words not clear.] Very simple, they adopted [changed to] the Jewish religion.

00:01:44.707 --> 00:01:46.457
David Boder: Your parents?

00:01:46.457 --> 00:01:47.956
Clara Neiman: Yes, my parents. They have left already for Palestine.

00:01:47.956 --> 00:01:50.283
David Boder: Your parents are already in Palestine?

00:01:50.283 --> 00:01:51.189
Clara Neiman: In Palestine. Yes.

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.876
David Boder: Now tell me. How many years ago did your parents go over to Judaism?

00:01:54.876 --> 00:01:56.954
Clara Neiman: Approximately already twenty years.

00:01:56.954 --> 00:01:59.797
David Boder: And they lived all that time in Russia?

00:01:59.797 --> 00:02:02.821
Clara Neiman: No, not in Russia. They lived in Baku, in Gruziya [Georgia].

00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:03.665
David Boder: Oh.

00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:05.415
Clara Neiman: In Gruziya, in the Caucasus.

00:02:05.415 --> 00:02:06.352
David Boder: In the Caucasus.

00:02:06.352 --> 00:02:07.055
Clara Neiman: Yes, in the Caucasus.

00:02:07.055 --> 00:02:10.180
David Boder: Now then, your father and mother both were born Russians?

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:18.442
Clara Neiman: Born Russians, who went over [to Judaism], but we...I still was not...but the other already [were born in Jewish faith]. I and my older brother, already deceased, were not born [as Jews]. A year of two before or later.

00:02:18.442 --> 00:02:19.255
David Boder: And your mother.

00:02:19.255 --> 00:02:21.333
Clara Neiman: Mother was just like a Jewess of course.

00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:22.099
David Boder: So.

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.615
Clara Neiman: Yes.

00:02:22.615 --> 00:02:23.365
David Boder: When you were born?

00:02:23.365 --> 00:02:25.865
Clara Neiman: When I was born [she apparently is somewhat confused]. Maybe a year or two earlier [she had become a Jewess].

00:02:25.865 --> 00:02:29.099
David Boder: So, afterwards. Then you already were not christened?

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.302
Clara Neiman: No, no, us not. We were already like Jews.

00:02:31.302 --> 00:02:36.739
David Boder: And...could you possibly explain why your parents decided to adopt Judaism?

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.387
Clara Neiman: How come? Well, they...they were not Russian. They were not Russians [meaning not Greek Orthodox]. They were Sectarians [dissenters from the official Russian Church].

00:02:42.387 --> 00:02:44.121
David Boder: Oh. They were Sectarians.

00:02:44.121 --> 00:02:44.840
Clara Neiman: Of a different sect.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.153
David Boder: To which sect did they belong?

00:02:45.153 --> 00:02:45.497
Clara Neiman: To another sect.

00:02:45.497 --> 00:02:45.903
David Boder: Yes, of course.

00:02:45.903 --> 00:02:47.544
Clara Neiman: They were Molokans [see note at end of chapter].

00:02:47.544 --> 00:02:50.216
David Boder: Then you come from the Molokans!

00:02:50.216 --> 00:02:50.622
Clara Neiman: Yes.

00:02:50.622 --> 00:02:52.357
David Boder: So. And then?

00:02:52.357 --> 00:03:01.076
Clara Neiman: And then they decided to change to Judaism, that this was already the real [right] religion. The first changed to Sabbatarianism and afterwards became real Jews.

00:03:01.076 --> 00:03:02.873
David Boder: So they changed first to Sabbatarianism?

00:03:02.873 --> 00:03:07.623
Clara Neiman: No [?]. They first just observed the Sabbath and then adopted all the Jewish laws.

00:03:07.623 --> 00:03:10.810
David Boder: So were there many such people in that locality?

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.481
Clara Neiman: Seventy people took it on at that time, seventy...seventy families.

00:03:14.481 --> 00:03:16.247
David Boder: Seventy families adopted Judaism.

00:03:16.247 --> 00:03:18.669
Clara Neiman: Seventy families adopted Judaism when our mother was already converted[?].

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:19.231
David Boder: Already twenty years ago?

00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:24.675
Clara Neiman: Already twenty years ago. And many of our gers [strangers, Christians converted to Judaism] are already there, in Palestine. They lived in Tel-Aviv. They left in the year ’24.

00:03:24.675 --> 00:03:25.956
David Boder: They left in the year ’24?

00:03:25.956 --> 00:03:28.438
Clara Neiman: Left in the year ’24. Tel-Aviv was not yet completed.

00:03:28.438 --> 00:03:30.799
David Boder: And how did they get out at that time from Russia to Palestine?

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.783
Clara Neiman: They...they crossed the black border [crossed illegally].

00:03:32.783 --> 00:03:33.693
David Boder: The black border.

00:03:33.693 --> 00:03:35.477
Clara Neiman: The black border.

00:03:35.477 --> 00:03:44.705
David Boder: Now tell me Clara Adamorna, where were you when the war started?

00:03:44.705 --> 00:03:46.840
Clara Neiman: We were in Gruziya in the city of Kutais.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.808
David Boder: But you [your folks] are not Caucasians [not born in the Caucasus region].

00:03:48.808 --> 00:03:51.824
Clara Neiman: No, no. We moved from the city of Saratov where we were born.

00:03:51.824 --> 00:03:53.417
David Boder: You were born in Saratov.

00:03:53.417 --> 00:03:56.136
Clara Neiman: We moved. The children were born already in the Ukraine. We lived also in the Ukraine.

00:03:56.136 --> 00:03:57.745
David Boder: Then how did you get to Gruziya?

00:03:57.745 --> 00:04:02.781
Clara Neiman: To Gruziya we got still before the war. We arrived there about five [?] years before the war.

00:04:02.781 --> 00:04:03.359
David Boder: So.

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:07.507
Clara Neiman: Before the war. And then we were all the time in Gruziya. Already twenty five years that we got there. Still before the war. [Her time data are somewhat confused.]

00:04:07.507 --> 00:04:09.850
David Boder: And how did you decide...Why did you decide to move to Gruziya?

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.928
Clara Neiman: It was very difficult to live in Russia.

00:04:11.928 --> 00:04:12.615
David Boder: For whom?

00:04:12.615 --> 00:04:14.193
Clara Neiman: In general for us it was very hard to live.

00:04:14.193 --> 00:04:15.318
David Boder: And in Gruziya?

00:04:15.318 --> 00:04:27.896
Clara Neiman: We were unable to observe properly Judaism. It was impossible to observe one’s religion, and mother had established by correspondence [?] that we had acquaintances there who had gone over [to Judaism]. So we moved to Gruziya.

00:04:27.896 --> 00:04:32.349
David Boder: Aha. And the Soviets? Did they permit you to move to Gruziya?

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:34.661
Clara Neiman: Nothing. They had nothing against that.

00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:37.775
David Boder: Now tell me. But Gruziya, too, belongs to the Soviets.

00:04:37.775 --> 00:04:43.468
Clara Neiman: Gruziya belongs to the Soviets, but there was more freedom, life was more comfortable. There was [no] shortage.

00:04:43.468 --> 00:04:44.062
David Boder: So.

00:04:44.062 --> 00:04:45.297
Clara Neiman: Clothes were very cheap. It was better...better to live.

00:04:45.297 --> 00:04:46.360
David Boder: At any rate it was better to live.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.735
Clara Neiman: Yes.

00:04:46.735 --> 00:04:48.657
David Boder: And you, what were you there? Peasants?

00:04:48.657 --> 00:04:52.675
Clara Neiman: I worked in a knitting shop [Jersey]. Father also worked in a factory. The brothers also worked in factories [few words not clear].

00:04:52.675 --> 00:04:53.862
David Boder: All of you worked.

00:04:53.862 --> 00:04:56.587
Clara Neiman: My sister is now here, too. Her family is here, too. My husband...

00:04:56.587 --> 00:04:57.830
David Boder: Your sister is here, too?

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.693
Clara Neiman: We were unable to leave together illegally, because of the children. They had a child and I a little boy.

00:05:03.693 --> 00:05:04.766
David Boder: So. So you...

00:05:04.766 --> 00:05:06.687
Clara Neiman: And we haven’t left yet.

00:05:06.687 --> 00:05:08.504
David Boder: Oh, you mean you couldn’t go illegally to Palestine?

00:05:08.504 --> 00:05:13.723
Clara Neiman: We couldn’t. Because mother went illegally with father, a brother and already a grown up sister.

00:05:13.723 --> 00:05:14.598
David Boder: They are in Tel-Aviv?

00:05:14.598 --> 00:05:17.864
Clara Neiman: Yes. They live already in Tel-Aviv. Already a month that they live in Tel-Aviv, liberated, in freedom.

00:05:17.864 --> 00:05:22.999
David Boder: Why do you say that they were liberated? Were they held...

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:24.499
Clara Neiman: They were in a lager.

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:25.843
David Boder: Aha. And afterwards. they were not free.

00:05:25.843 --> 00:05:30.780
Clara Neiman: They had a very hard time. They were even without water for three days.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.405
David Boder: Hm. Now tell me. Speak a bit in this direction [of the microphone].

00:05:35.405 --> 00:05:36.045
Clara Neiman: Yes, yes, yes. So...

00:05:36.045 --> 00:05:40.466
David Boder: So. Now tell me, when the war started you were in Kutais.

00:05:40.466 --> 00:05:41.372
Clara Neiman: Yes. In the city of Kutais.

00:05:41.372 --> 00:05:42.715
David Boder: Now tell me...

00:05:42.715 --> 00:05:43.715
Clara Neiman: A big Jewish city.

00:05:43.715 --> 00:05:44.387
David Boder: [Astonished] A big Jewish city.

00:05:44.387 --> 00:05:48.450
Clara Neiman: A Jewish city. There were altogether seventy [?] synagogues. That’s how big a city it was.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.824
David Boder: In Kutais?

00:05:48.824 --> 00:05:49.293
Clara Neiman: Yes.

00:05:49.293 --> 00:05:50.434
David Boder: How come?

00:05:50.434 --> 00:05:56.180
Clara Neiman: It was very big...of course, a very big city. It’s a Jewish city. [Footnote: This is of course incorrect. But having had a more liberal government and considering the advanced of the Germans, the Caucasus in general may have had a large influx of Jewish refugees, especially in the cities located near the Turkish border.]

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.559
David Boder: Now tell me, the Jews there were Russian Jews?

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:06.162
Clara Neiman: [Word not clear; sound like Proskiri] Gruziyan Jews. There were various Jewish nations [adjective not clear], very pious Jews. All the synagogues were full.

00:06:06.162 --> 00:06:07.099
David Boder: In Kutais?

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:08.677
Clara Neiman: In Kutais. Afterwards we left for Russia.

00:06:08.677 --> 00:06:09.239
David Boder: Aha.

00:06:09.239 --> 00:06:11.520
Clara Neiman: In Russia it was very difficult to observe religion.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.879
David Boder: In Russia with religion...

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:26.475
Clara Neiman: [Sounds like: For Jews] it was very difficult.[ A wisper, not clear.] Everything was prohibited. Later one it [religious observance] became already open, since it [the four freedoms] was reported in the newpapers from England, from America, that they demand it. [Her rapid speech begins to telescope the sentences.] And so before the war...one may say after the war...Before the war it was harder...At any rate we did not adjust[?] there any more. People travelled...

00:06:26.475 --> 00:06:29.787
David Boder: Good. When the war started you were in Kutais.

00:06:29.787 --> 00:06:30.319
Clara Neiman: Yes.

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:39.600
David Boder: Now, tell me in detail where and how all these things happened. Where were you during the war, and did you finally get to Paris? Don’t hurry. We have time.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.881
Clara Neiman: [With a chuckle] Aha, good. It was like this. When we were in Kutais, I married a Pole.

00:06:44.881 --> 00:06:45.912
David Boder: A Pole?

00:06:45.912 --> 00:06:47.427
Clara Neiman: A Pole, a Jew. My husband is a collect Jew. [Possibly one who belongs to a collective farm. I am not sure of the meaning of this apparently makeshift word.]

00:06:47.427 --> 00:06:49.284
David Boder: So.

00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:52.081
Clara Neiman: And afterwards we decided to travel to Poland.

00:06:52.081 --> 00:06:52.519
David Boder: Aha.

00:06:52.519 --> 00:06:56.646
Clara Neiman: I left for Poland, while mother and sister remained there.

00:06:56.646 --> 00:06:58.053
David Boder: In what city?

00:06:58.053 --> 00:06:59.521
Clara Neiman: In the city of Kutais. The sister lived there.

00:06:59.521 --> 00:06:59.974
David Boder: So.

00:06:59.974 --> 00:07:02.052
Clara Neiman: The sister lived there. The sister, too, got married in Kutais.

00:07:02.052 --> 00:07:04.012
David Boder: And how did the Polish Jews get to Gruziya?

00:07:04.012 --> 00:07:06.381
Clara Neiman: They were in Gruziya. Very many [of them] were in Gruziya.

00:07:06.381 --> 00:07:07.100
David Boder: Polish Jews.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.068
Clara Neiman: Polish Jews, very many. they fled from the war.

00:07:09.068 --> 00:07:10.661
David Boder: Oh, this was already...

00:07:10.661 --> 00:07:12.450
Clara Neiman: This was already at the time of the slaughter [massacres].

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:14.077
David Boder: So. They evacuated themselves...

00:07:14.077 --> 00:07:14.499
Clara Neiman: Yes.

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:14.499
David Boder: . . . and went to Gruziya?

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:16.812
Clara Neiman: The third year since my marriage.

00:07:16.812 --> 00:07:17.343
David Boder: So.

00:07:17.343 --> 00:07:17.609
Clara Neiman: Three years had passed.

00:07:17.609 --> 00:07:20.562
David Boder: So. So. And he was an evacuee.

00:07:20.562 --> 00:07:22.155
Clara Neiman: He was an evacusee, yes. There were many such...

00:07:22.155 --> 00:07:23.061
David Boder: So.

00:07:23.061 --> 00:07:25.499
Clara Neiman: So we put up the Khupe [Hebrew: canape under which bride and groom stand during the Judaic marriage ceremony] there in the city of Kutais.

00:07:25.499 --> 00:07:26.780
David Boder: You put up what?

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.155
Clara Neiman: Khupe. We made a wedding like Jews.

00:07:28.155 --> 00:07:30.014
David Boder: So. Nu.

00:07:30.014 --> 00:07:34.717
Clara Neiman: Afterwards we decided to leave for Poland, afterwards already upon the termination of the war.

00:07:34.717 --> 00:07:35.077
David Boder: So.

00:07:35.077 --> 00:07:37.748
Clara Neiman: During the first year after termination of the war we decided to depart for Poland.

00:07:37.748 --> 00:07:38.342
David Boder: So.

00:07:38.342 --> 00:07:49.296
Clara Neiman: And we departed, with my husband, for Poland. We spent there, let us say, five months. Afterwards mother arrived. I sent word for her to come. I wrote to her, between lines, because it was not possible to write [openly]...

00:07:49.296 --> 00:07:49.920
David Boder: So.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.748
Clara Neiman: . . . that mother should come, that possibly there will be a chance to get to Palestine.

00:07:52.748 --> 00:07:53.279
David Boder: So.

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:58.372
Clara Neiman: Only I wrote to her in a manner that the letter should reach her. You of course understand.

00:07:58.372 --> 00:07:59.670
David Boder: So that the letter should pass [Soviet] censorship.

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:03.951
Clara Neiman: Yes. And so finally mother arrived among us in Russia [?]

00:08:03.951 --> 00:08:05.047
David Boder: So.

00:08:05.047 --> 00:08:05.632
Clara Neiman: Mother arrived...

00:08:05.632 --> 00:08:06.763
David Boder: Where to? Where did you live, in Poland?

00:08:06.763 --> 00:08:08.216
Clara Neiman: In Poland, in the city of Lodz.

00:08:08.216 --> 00:08:08.981
David Boder: [With surprise] In Lodz?

00:08:08.981 --> 00:08:09.856
Clara Neiman: Petrokovska [street] 23.

00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:10.809
David Boder: To the city of Lodz.

00:08:10.809 --> 00:08:12.856
Clara Neiman: Yes. On the main street, Petrokovska 23...

00:08:12.856 --> 00:08:13.730
David Boder: So.

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:14.887
Clara Neiman: . . . we lived.

00:08:14.887 --> 00:08:16.043
David Boder: So.

00:08:16.043 --> 00:08:21.326
Clara Neiman: Well, we lived — nothing to complain about. My husband is a tailor. We started to earn well. But still there was great anti-Semitism, and they started to kill a lot of Jews. In our time there were...there took place a great number of [word not clear] assaults.

00:08:21.326 --> 00:08:22.108
David Boder: Pogroms?

00:08:22.108 --> 00:08:22.749
Clara Neiman: Pogroms.

00:08:22.749 --> 00:08:23.233
David Boder: So.

00:08:23.233 --> 00:08:29.014
Clara Neiman: So I wrote my mother a letter, so she came...Come winter, they decided to leave. My sister, my mother, the whole family left.

00:08:29.014 --> 00:08:29.936
David Boder: They came to [word not clear].

00:08:29.936 --> 00:08:31.202
Clara Neiman: No, to us.

00:08:31.202 --> 00:08:31.655
David Boder: From Kutais?

00:08:31.655 --> 00:08:38.311
Clara Neiman: A city in Gruziya. They arrived in Poland, and afterwards they lived with me for three months. They wintered through the winter.

00:08:38.311 --> 00:08:38.998
David Boder: Hm.

00:08:38.998 --> 00:08:43.357
Clara Neiman: We were registered with a Jewish faction, of course with a Jewish organization with whom we now have arrived.

00:08:43.357 --> 00:08:43.845
David Boder: Agudah?

00:08:43.845 --> 00:08:44.435
Clara Neiman: Agudah.

00:08:44.435 --> 00:08:44.951
David Boder: So.

00:08:44.951 --> 00:08:53.312
Clara Neiman: In Lodz. And we decided...and afterwards they accepted us. They registered us first. And afterwards it was impossible to travel in the winter. It was, of course, difficult to travel with children.

00:08:53.312 --> 00:08:53.656
David Boder: So.

00:08:53.656 --> 00:08:57.521
Clara Neiman: And afterwards in March...in the month of April we already departed.

00:08:57.521 --> 00:08:58.953
David Boder: And how did the father come [join] you?

00:08:58.953 --> 00:09:01.177
Clara Neiman: And the father had arrived when we had written.

00:09:01.177 --> 00:09:01.984
David Boder: Together with mother?

00:09:01.984 --> 00:09:02.218
Clara Neiman: Yes.

00:09:02.218 --> 00:09:02.640
David Boder: Oh.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.202
Clara Neiman: Together with mother and the family. And the sister, too, with the family.

00:09:05.202 --> 00:09:07.534
David Boder: How come? Did they come like Poles or like [word not clear]?

00:09:07.534 --> 00:09:10.390
Clara Neiman: Well, they...my husband, too, [came] like a Pole.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:10.843
David Boder: Hm.

00:09:10.843 --> 00:09:19.280
Clara Neiman: My husband, too, as a [word not clear, possible equivalent: a Polish citizen]. And as to mother it was permitted [as] announced in the newspaper that one who has in Poland a son or a daughter may leave [for Poland].

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.015
David Boder: Aha.

00:09:20.015 --> 00:09:22.768
Clara Neiman: And mother. [She for some reason fails in general to mention the father], mother has remained alone [ in Kutais] and as an old person.

00:09:22.768 --> 00:09:23.174
David Boder: So.

00:09:23.174 --> 00:09:35.830
Clara Neiman: My two brothers now study in the Yeshiva [school of higher Judaic learning]. They have decided to go to America. They study in a Yeshiva in Luxenben, in the city of Luxenben.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:36.580
David Boder: Luxemben?

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:37.486
Clara Neiman: Luxenben, yes.

00:09:37.486 --> 00:09:38.611
David Boder: They are now in Luxemburg?

00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:39.768
Clara Neiman: They study in the Yeshiva. They study.

00:09:39.768 --> 00:09:40.659
David Boder: The younger...[?]

00:09:40.659 --> 00:09:42.347
Clara Neiman: The youngest...the youngest two brothers. Yes.

00:09:42.347 --> 00:09:42.753
David Boder: So.

00:09:42.753 --> 00:09:43.534
Clara Neiman: But they have not left yet.

00:09:43.534 --> 00:09:44.191
David Boder: So.

00:09:44.191 --> 00:09:47.331
Clara Neiman: And that is how we got here. We live here already five months. Thank God.

00:09:47.331 --> 00:09:50.284
David Boder: That means you have two brothers, younger ones, studying in the Luxemburg
                        Yeshiva.

00:09:50.284 --> 00:09:52.237
Clara Neiman: [They talk in unison]...two brothers, younger ones, in Luxemburg
                        Yeshiva.

00:09:52.237 --> 00:09:53.893
David Boder: Now where is that, in Lux-...in Luxemburg?

00:09:53.893 --> 00:09:56.421
Clara Neiman: In Luxemburg there is a large Yeshiva, and they study there.

00:09:56.421 --> 00:09:59.288
David Boder: Why do you say that they intend to go to America?

00:09:59.288 --> 00:10:13.050
Clara Neiman: They already...they had already the visa in their hands, but for some reason they have not left yet. Only one of them [of the students?] had a chance to leave. Meanwhile we had contact this week...last week, with two people [from there,] and they told us that they [the brothers] have not left yet, and that we should write letters to them.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.050
David Boder: Aha. Now then...

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:16.768
Clara Neiman: They don’t know yet that our mother has left.

00:10:16.768 --> 00:10:18.051
David Boder: Aha. They don’t know yet about your mother?

00:10:18.051 --> 00:10:19.082
Clara Neiman: No, nothing.

00:10:19.082 --> 00:10:20.503
David Boder: And you, have you received letters already?

00:10:20.503 --> 00:10:29.792
Clara Neiman: No, we have received nothing from mother. Why she does not write I don’t know. But those who have left on that steamer with mother write that everything is very well, that they are fairing very well in Tel Aviv, and that some of them, the young people, have joined a Kibbutz, while some have remained in [word not clear].

00:10:29.792 --> 00:10:33.781
David Boder: Now tell me, you don’t know yet that your parents have reached Palestine?

00:10:33.781 --> 00:10:46.561
Clara Neiman: They...we know. It was reported...[sounds like: the Czechs] have reported that [of] the steamer which has arrived at [name not clear, posssibly a port on Cyprus] they have set free nearly all. Some of them left for Tel-Aviv, and some remained at [name not clear].

00:10:46.561 --> 00:10:47.993
David Boder: So. But from your mother...

00:10:47.993 --> 00:10:48.804
Clara Neiman: But from our mother we have heard nothing.

00:10:48.804 --> 00:10:49.792
David Boder: And from your father you have received nothing [no word].

00:10:49.792 --> 00:10:51.870
Clara Neiman: No, nothing.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:59.620
David Boder: Aha. Now tell me this. During the war you were in Kutais?

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:00.745
Clara Neiman: In the city of Kutais.

00:11:00.745 --> 00:11:02.901
David Boder: And the war did not reach it?

00:11:02.901 --> 00:11:06.120
Clara Neiman: There were twice strong bombardments, only two times. There was no war [there].

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:06.755
David Boder: So, but...

00:11:06.755 --> 00:11:12.909
Clara Neiman: The war was about twenty five...[corrects] hundred twenty five kilometers away [word not clear]. And afterwards they were driven back.

00:11:12.909 --> 00:11:18.050
David Boder: Aha. Now with whom are you here in Hénonville? With your husband?

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:19.534
Clara Neiman: With my husband and baby.

00:11:19.534 --> 00:11:21.143
David Boder: With one baby. That is your family.

00:11:21.143 --> 00:11:22.659
Clara Neiman: Yes.

00:11:22.659 --> 00:11:26.125
David Boder: So. Now tell me how do you live here. You have a separate room for your family.

00:11:26.125 --> 00:11:27.890
Clara Neiman: A separate [room]. Everything is fine.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:28.671
David Boder: So.

00:11:28.671 --> 00:11:36.983
Clara Neiman: We live, thank God, well. There is food, there is drink, cleanliness. Everything one may say is fine.

00:11:36.983 --> 00:11:43.205
David Boder: Now tell me. You say that in your locality were...you were in Saratov or Samara?

00:11:43.205 --> 00:11:44.906
Clara Neiman: In Saratov.

00:11:44.906 --> 00:11:45.680
David Boder: Yes, in Saratov.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.381
Clara Neiman: It’s not very...yes, in Russia

00:11:46.381 --> 00:11:50.936
David Boder: So. And there was a large number of “Russians” who have become Jews?

00:11:50.936 --> 00:11:52.608
Clara Neiman: Yes. But they, too, have departed from here. They do not remain there.

00:11:52.608 --> 00:11:55.443
David Boder: So. And who were your rabbis?

00:11:55.443 --> 00:11:57.420
Clara Neiman: In Saratov there were many Jews.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:57.936
David Boder: So.

00:11:57.936 --> 00:12:06.797
Clara Neiman: Our mother...mother’s own sister lived in Saratov in the city of Saratov. Through her she became acquainted with Jews in general, and so she decided to go to Judaism. [Consistently it is the mother, not the father or the parents].

00:12:06.797 --> 00:12:08.548
David Boder: She was not originally married to a Jew?

00:12:08.548 --> 00:12:10.182
Clara Neiman: Mama? No, no. No, no.

00:12:10.182 --> 00:12:11.414
David Boder: And your father was then a pure Russian.

00:12:11.414 --> 00:12:20.436
Clara Neiman: Yes, yes. No, not a pure [Greek Orthodox]. They were sectarians. that is why they got into [words not clear]. They were digging [debating, urging, hesitating] digging, digging, and decided to go over, to adopt the Jewish religion, because it is proper to have this belief, not the belief they had before.

00:12:20.436 --> 00:12:21.342
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:21.342 --> 00:12:23.484
Clara Neiman: And so they went over.

00:12:23.484 --> 00:12:25.820
David Boder: Now. And you speak Yiddish, too?

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:26.732
Clara Neiman: [From here the dialogue proceeds in Yiddish, which she speaks beautifully.] Yes, I speak Yiddish.

00:12:26.732 --> 00:12:27.582
David Boder: [Wondering] You speak Yiddish?

00:12:27.582 --> 00:12:28.545
Clara Neiman: Yes, I speak Yiddish.

00:12:28.545 --> 00:12:30.193
David Boder: Where did you learn Yiddish?

00:12:30.193 --> 00:12:35.858
Clara Neiman: I? When did I learn it? When we lived...when we left Russia and lived in a Jewish city.

00:12:35.858 --> 00:12:36.577

Clara Neiman: [With laughter] Yes.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:58.033

00:14:36.723 --> 00:14:38.488
David Boder: Already a year. Well. First you intended...

00:14:38.488 --> 00:14:41.309
Clara Neiman: [Interrupting] No, no, no, we went first [few words not clear].

00:14:41.309 --> 00:14:45.025
David Boder: First you thought to remain in Poland.

00:14:45.025 --> 00:14:54.946
Clara Neiman: No. We did not think so. We specially were going away from [word not clear, possible from persecution]. You understand? When we got to Poland one could not live [?] in Poland. You understand? So we first went to Poland, and in Poland we could see already where people are going. And so...

00:14:54.946 --> 00:14:56.196
David Boder: Where people are going...

00:14:56.196 --> 00:14:56.665
Clara Neiman: Yes [chuckle].

00:14:56.665 --> 00:14:59.727
David Boder: And how did you get from Poland to France? Tell me that.

00:14:59.727 --> 00:15:04.413
Clara Neiman: How we traveled by train. We traveled in small groups by ancua [? She uses apparently a French colloquialsim or mispronounces the word; it means bus].

00:15:04.413 --> 00:15:04.828
David Boder: How did you travel?

00:15:04.828 --> 00:15:06.561
Clara Neiman: I traveled by [sounds like avcua].

00:15:06.561 --> 00:15:07.413
David Boder: The whole...What does it mean, avcua?

00:15:07.413 --> 00:15:10.853
Clara Neiman: We traveled altogether four days to [word not clear].

00:15:10.853 --> 00:15:11.400
David Boder: Aha.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.478
Clara Neiman: And there we waited a month’s time.

00:15:13.478 --> 00:15:15.743
David Boder: Yes. Where did you wait month’s time?

00:15:15.743 --> 00:15:16.836
Clara Neiman: Well, in rooms.

00:15:16.836 --> 00:15:17.883
David Boder: At a committee [shelter house]?

00:15:17.883 --> 00:15:20.833
Clara Neiman: Yes, at a committee. It was arranged by the Agudah. There was food...

00:15:20.833 --> 00:15:21.132
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:21.132 --> 00:15:21.748
Clara Neiman: There was drink and...

00:15:21.748 --> 00:15:24.867
David Boder: Oh. The Agudah has taken you over already from Poland?

00:15:24.867 --> 00:15:27.055
Clara Neiman: From Lodz. Right from Poland. Yes.

00:15:27.055 --> 00:15:30.339
David Boder: Yes. And they took you from Lodz and...

00:15:30.339 --> 00:15:31.463
Clara Neiman: From Lodz through...

00:15:31.463 --> 00:15:32.219
David Boder: To Prague.

00:15:32.219 --> 00:15:35.737
Clara Neiman: Yes, to Prague. From Prague we also came by avcua [bus].

00:15:35.737 --> 00:15:36.305
David Boder: Aha.

00:15:36.305 --> 00:15:37.604
Clara Neiman: We traveled by bus.

00:15:37.604 --> 00:15:38.962
David Boder: By bus you traveled?

00:15:38.962 --> 00:15:39.822
Clara Neiman: Yes, yes, and illegally.

00:15:39.822 --> 00:15:42.135
David Boder: How far, all to France? In busses?

00:15:42.135 --> 00:15:42.791

00:15:44.713 --> 00:15:48.416
Clara Neiman: We passed through. Yes. There we met our brothers.

00:15:48.416 --> 00:15:49.400
David Boder: [Surprised] O-oh.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.635
Clara Neiman: This is how we found them. I shall tell you. We arrived at dawn.

00:15:52.635 --> 00:15:53.448
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:53.448 --> 00:16:00.525
Clara Neiman: You understand? I was to. We left...we traveled four days. So it came to be Friday night [the eve of the Sabbath].

00:16:00.525 --> 00:16:00.994
David Boder: Yes.

00:16:00.994 --> 00:16:03.463
Clara Neiman: So we had arrived on Thursday...

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:03.838
David Boder: Yes.

00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:07.385
Clara Neiman: . . . coming to France. And Friday we were already in the hotel.

00:16:07.385 --> 00:16:07.854
David Boder: Hm.

00:16:07.854 --> 00:16:09.992
Clara Neiman: And there we already...and from there I transferred [rest of sentence not clear].

00:16:09.992 --> 00:16:12.808
David Boder: Was the Rabbi Horwitz with you? [See Chapter 42.]

00:16:12.808 --> 00:16:20.299
Clara Neiman: Not there, not there, not there. He was already later...[correction] they had come earlier. They were already here at this place [?], but a few families [?] were still in Paris.

00:16:20.299 --> 00:16:20.807
David Boder: Yes.

00:16:20.807 --> 00:16:21.563
Clara Neiman: They were not transferred.

00:16:21.563 --> 00:16:22.282
David Boder: Well.

00:16:22.282 --> 00:16:26.220
Clara Neiman: And so since we were in Paris, we ate in a refectory.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:32.767
David Boder: Hm. [Pause.] Now then, and what are you doing here all day?

00:16:32.767 --> 00:16:44.044
Clara Neiman: Here? No worry. I do what I wish [?] My husband goes to work in the garden. And I have to take care, of course, of the little baby. I have to watch [?] him.

00:16:44.044 --> 00:16:47.075
David Boder: Aha. And where do you eat? You eat in the...

00:16:47.075 --> 00:16:48.138
Clara Neiman: In the refectory.

00:16:48.138 --> 00:16:54.982
David Boder: In the refectory. Aha. All together? Or you eat with the women separately from the men?

00:16:54.982 --> 00:16:58.826
Clara Neiman: We eat separately. In the same refectory, but [we sit] separately.

00:16:58.826 --> 00:17:03.388
David Boder: Yes. You eat separately. And the same when you go to prayer. You are separated.

00:17:03.388 --> 00:17:07.435
Clara Neiman: Yes. For breakfast, for dinner, for supper [?].

00:17:07.435 --> 00:17:11.153
David Boder: Yes. So you don’t have to cook for yourselves.

00:17:11.153 --> 00:17:11.622
Clara Neiman: No.

00:17:11.622 --> 00:17:13.122
David Boder: And for the baby?

00:17:13.122 --> 00:17:16.749
Clara Neiman: No, for the child they don’t cook, Surely I cannot take the child to the refectory [?].

00:17:16.749 --> 00:17:17.426
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:17.426 --> 00:17:20.179
Clara Neiman: I have in my place a little oven, so I cook [for him] on the oven.

00:17:20.179 --> 00:17:21.429
David Boder: You have a little oven.

00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:22.711

00:17:24.108 --> 00:17:27.254
David Boder: And your husband? He is a tailor as well [in addition to his agricultural work]?

00:17:27.254 --> 00:17:32.886
Clara Neiman: He is a tailor, a good tailor for men’s, women’s [these few words said in Russian were not clear.]

00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:33.667
David Boder: What does that mean?

00:17:33.667 --> 00:17:35.339
Clara Neiman: [In Yiddish] For the man and for...

00:17:35.339 --> 00:17:35.871

Clara Neiman: Men’s and women’s

00:17:38.261 --> 00:17:39.717
David Boder: Hm, a men’s and women’s tailor.

00:17:39.717 --> 00:17:45.977
David Boder: [In Yiddish] So in Palestine, in Eretz Yisroeil what do you think you will do? You will have a tailor shop or you will work on the land?

00:17:45.977 --> 00:17:53.639

00:17:57.745 --> 00:18:18.185
David Boder: Well, Clara Adamovna, that is very interesting. You have told us, indeed, someting completely new, and I think we will all be interested to hear it. Anything else that you want to tell me, some other interesting things that you have lived through during the war? [Pause.]

00:18:18.185 --> 00:18:20.894
Clara Neiman: [Laughter.]

00:18:20.894 --> 00:18:22.634

Clara Neiman: [In Russian]...a year and a half.

00:18:28.444 --> 00:18:29.422
David Boder: A year and a half.

00:18:29.422 --> 00:18:31.475

00:18:39.409 --> 00:18:42.689
Clara Neiman: A boy. [Laughter.] A big brat. [She uses colloquial expressions hence the question.]

David Boder: A big what?

00:18:43.252 --> 00:18:44.360

00:18:52.667 --> 00:19:30.786
David Boder: [In English] This concludes the interview with Mrs. Clara Adamovna Neiman, at Hénonville near Paris, in a Kibbutz, rather...of a rather religious organization. She is a representative of a Russian family which became converted to Judaism through Molokanism, not for motive of marriage. And she was brought up as a Jew by her parents. And, eh...Her parents are already now in Palestine, and [so is] one brother. Oh, yes...

00:19:30.786 --> 00:19:34.367

00:19:36.476 --> 00:19:38.554

00:19:38.554 --> 00:19:42.600

David Boder: [A few words not clear.]

00:19:57.043 --> 00:20:05.188
Clara Neiman: My husband enters: they were going to prayer [two Hebrew words]. He entered the Synagogue. So he says, are there here a couple of boys, Gers [Christians converted to Judaism].

00:20:05.188 --> 00:20:05.876

David Boder: Yes.

00:20:20.511 --> 00:20:35.014
Clara Neiman: [Few words not clear]. They were now well dressed. We then took leave from them [the wire is noisy for about a sentence]. I don’t know..., but of course they will go to America.

00:20:35.014 --> 00:20:36.276
David Boder: Thank you very much.

00:20:36.276 --> 00:20:39.666
