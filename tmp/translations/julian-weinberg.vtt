00:00:00.271 --> 00:00:02.377
David Boder: [In German] You can speak Yiddish or German, as you wish.

00:00:02.377 --> 00:00:02.678
Julian Weinberg: Hm.

00:00:02.678 --> 00:00:05.361
David Boder: Where are you from?

00:00:05.361 --> 00:00:08.193
Julian Weinberg: I come from...from Lodz

00:00:08.193 --> 00:00:08.735
David Boder: Ja.

00:00:08.735 --> 00:00:09.458
Julian Weinberg: Poland.

00:00:09.458 --> 00:00:15.542
David Boder: Poland. What is your full name?

00:00:15.542 --> 00:00:33.918
David Boder: [In English] August 17, 1946. Paris, Grand Hotel...Hotel, Spool Number 49. An Illinois Institute of Technology recording. The interviewee is the engineer Julian Weinberg, from Lodz, Poland.

00:00:33.918 --> 00:00:41.490
David Boder: [In German] Now then, Mr. Weinberg, will you please tell us again, what is your name, and where you are from?

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:49.773
Julian Weinberg: My name is Julian Weinberg, from Lodz, Poland.

00:00:49.773 --> 00:00:52.364
David Boder: What are you doing now in Lodz, Mr. Weinberg?

00:00:52.364 --> 00:01:01.051
Julian Weinberg: I am now the managing director of the Electric Works, Lodz.

00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:01.696
David Boder: Yes...

00:01:01.696 --> 00:01:07.973
Julian Weinberg: One of the larger electric plants.

00:01:07.973 --> 00:01:13.967
David Boder: Yes. Now tell me, were you also before the war connected with these works?

00:01:13.967 --> 00:01:20.985
Julian Weinberg: Yes. I worked before the war too, in this plant since 1911...

00:01:20.985 --> 00:01:21.588
David Boder: Yes...

00:01:21.588 --> 00:01:40.516
Julian Weinberg: . . . and in the year...this year, 1946, I have celebrated the thirty-fifth Jubilee of my services in these electric plants.

00:01:40.516 --> 00:01:45.859
David Boder: Yes. But you look like a very young man, Mr. Weinberg. How old are you?

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:49.444
Julian Weinberg: I was born in 1890...

00:01:49.444 --> 00:01:50.028
David Boder: Aha...

00:01:50.028 --> 00:01:52.197
Julian Weinberg: I am fifty-six years old...

00:01:52.197 --> 00:01:53.492
David Boder: Yes...

00:01:53.492 --> 00:02:07.498
Julian Weinberg: And as a twenty year old man I already took over the post of engineer in the Electrical Works of Lodz.

00:02:07.498 --> 00:02:08.673
David Boder: So that was still when...

00:02:08.673 --> 00:02:17.028
Julian Weinberg: Right after...that was in 1911—that means, short after my graduation.

00:02:17.028 --> 00:02:17.450
David Boder: Yes...

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:31.908
Julian Weinberg: I studied in Paris. I was...I studied mathematics at the Sorbonne and then I graduated from the Politechnicum in Nancy.

00:02:31.908 --> 00:02:36.649
David Boder: So, then, you were an engineer during the time Poland was [part of] Russia.

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:37.836
Julian Weinberg: Sure.

00:02:37.836 --> 00:02:38.119
David Boder: Yes...

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.782
Julian Weinberg: Exactly!

00:02:38.782 --> 00:02:41.716
David Boder: You were employed in spite of being a Jew?

00:02:41.716 --> 00:02:46.638
Julian Weinberg: Yes...when Poland still belonged to Russia.

00:02:46.638 --> 00:02:48.277
David Boder: Now tell me then, Mr. Weinberg...

00:02:48.277 --> 00:02:50.217
Julian Weinberg: That was ‘Congress Poland.’

00:02:50.217 --> 00:03:13.271
David Boder: Yes. I am a bit nervous [uneasy] because you don’t want to give me more than half an hour. And I know that you have to tell a great deal. I therefore should like to ask you...to ask you the following things. Answer a few questions. Where were you when the Germans marched into Poland?

00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:15.128
Julian Weinberg: In the last war?

00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:16.014
David Boder: Yes...

00:03:16.014 --> 00:03:17.562
Julian Weinberg: I was then in Lodz.

00:03:17.562 --> 00:03:19.369
David Boder: You were in Lodz at you job.

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:22.261
Julian Weinberg: At my job. Yes.

00:03:22.261 --> 00:03:31.731
David Boder: For how long did the Germans leave you alone [did not bother you]? [Pause.] How long did you continue working after the arrival of the Germans?

00:03:31.731 --> 00:03:36.201
Julian Weinberg: After the arrival of the Germans I worked...[pause]

00:03:36.201 --> 00:03:40.430
David Boder: Nu...

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.219
Julian Weinberg: . . . Two months.

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:42.791
David Boder: Two months.

00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:43.876
Julian Weinberg: Two months...

00:03:43.876 --> 00:03:44.490
David Boder: What have...?

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.243
Julian Weinberg: . . . And then...

00:03:45.243 --> 00:03:45.665
David Boder: Yes...

00:03:45.665 --> 00:03:50.123
Julian Weinberg: . . . our plant was taken over by an SS man...

00:03:50.123 --> 00:03:51.701
David Boder: Hm...

00:03:51.701 --> 00:04:06.069
Julian Weinberg: And I, as a Jew, had to leave my post. And so...

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.906
David Boder: And what did you do then?

00:04:09.906 --> 00:04:22.587
Julian Weinberg: Then an order came that all Jews were to leave the city, in order...to the ghetto.

00:04:22.587 --> 00:04:23.491
David Boder: . . . to move?

00:04:23.491 --> 00:04:24.497
Julian Weinberg: To move...Yes.

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:26.455
David Boder: [Aside:] Do you talk Yiddish better?

00:04:26.455 --> 00:04:27.521
Julian Weinberg: Makes no difference. [Footnote 1: His language difficulty may be due to two factors. (1) Long ghetto experience. (2) The strict adoption of the official Polish language after the liberation of Poland. —D.P.B.]

00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:34.961
David Boder: Now then. Describe to us, as an intelligent person [educated person], as an engineer...describe to us the ghetto of Lodz.

00:04:34.961 --> 00:05:32.717
Julian Weinberg: Even before we moved to the Ghetto we received such...[word not clear] marks of discrimination [??] as the armband, the yellow armband, so that we would be recognized on the streets as Jews. And then that appeared not enough to them, so they pasted [on us] such yellow stars from the front and on the back, so that from all sides it would be recognizable that here walks a Jew. Naturally the going about town was almost impossible for the Jews, because they were grabbed by the Germans on the streets. The Jews were [then] taken for most common labor. Regardless of who it was, whether he was a laborer or an intellectual, he had to perform the hardest forms of labor.

00:05:32.717 --> 00:05:36.344
David Boder: What kind of work were you compelled to do?

00:05:36.344 --> 00:05:44.579
Julian Weinberg: I, for example, was compelled one day to scrub floors...

00:05:44.579 --> 00:05:45.404
David Boder: Yes...

00:05:45.404 --> 00:06:30.504
Julian Weinberg: I also had an experience, when my mother had died on the fifth of March and I had to bury her. I was then the only one at the cemetery. Nobody was permitted to accompany the body to the grave, and when I was returning from the cemetery, I was grabbed on the street by a young Folk-German, dragged through a gate; and in the yard I was compelled to carry coal from a cart to the cellar...

00:06:30.504 --> 00:06:32.263
David Boder: Hm...

00:06:32.263 --> 00:06:34.793
Julian Weinberg: And that lasted several hours.

00:06:34.793 --> 00:06:35.094
David Boder: And [word not clear]

00:06:35.094 --> 00:06:40.727
Julian Weinberg: That was precisely when I was about to return home from the cemetery.

00:06:40.727 --> 00:06:48.992
David Boder: Now then, Mr. Weinberg, let us have that straight. Simply a boy, not an officer—not an official...

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:51.023
Julian Weinberg: No...

00:06:51.023 --> 00:06:55.347
Julian Weinberg: That was a boy—a young man of about twenty years of age...

00:06:55.347 --> 00:06:55.890
David Boder: Yes...

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.709
Julian Weinberg: With a whip.

00:06:57.709 --> 00:06:58.643
David Boder: Yes...

00:06:58.643 --> 00:07:04.155
Julian Weinberg: He grabbed me on the street and dragged me through the gate of a building.

00:07:04.155 --> 00:07:04.908
David Boder: Yes...

00:07:04.908 --> 00:07:16.354
Julian Weinberg: And there were many other Jews. About fifteen people were assembled there and all of them had to carry coal.

00:07:16.354 --> 00:07:20.432
David Boder: For whom was the coal carried? Was it a government office, or was it a private...

00:07:20.432 --> 00:07:30.191
Julian Weinberg: That was for the National Socialist Peoples’ Union [Nazy Party]; it was NSV.

00:07:30.191 --> 00:07:31.577
David Boder: Yes...And they simply...

00:07:31.577 --> 00:07:31.890
Julian Weinberg: NSV.

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:33.649
David Boder: . . . were detaining people on the streets...?

00:07:33.649 --> 00:07:34.011
Julian Weinberg: Yes...

00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:34.746
David Boder: . . . to make them work:

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:35.451
Julian Weinberg: Yes.

00:07:35.451 --> 00:07:37.240
David Boder: Now then...

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.108
Julian Weinberg: As the work was completed...

00:07:39.108 --> 00:07:39.903
David Boder: Yes...

00:07:39.903 --> 00:07:48.036
Julian Weinberg: . . . several were released to go home; but I, when they learned that I was an engineer—

00:07:48.036 --> 00:07:48.560
David Boder: Yes...

00:07:48.560 --> 00:08:06.331
Julian Weinberg: I was detained, and I had to remain for two hours longer, because they considered me an intellectual and I was compelled for another two hours to...

00:08:06.331 --> 00:08:06.753
David Boder: drag...

00:08:06.753 --> 00:08:13.753
Julian Weinberg: . . . to drag the coal. Yes. From one cellar to the other, I had to perform a perfectly useless task.

00:08:13.753 --> 00:08:15.801
David Boder: Oh, that was simply chicanery.

00:08:15.801 --> 00:08:18.633
Julian Weinberg: That was pure chicanery...

00:08:18.633 --> 00:08:18.946
David Boder: Yes...

00:08:18.946 --> 00:08:25.061
Julian Weinberg: And then, only at [late] hours, in the evening, was I able to go home.

00:08:25.061 --> 00:08:25.465
David Boder: Hm...

00:08:25.465 --> 00:08:47.314
Julian Weinberg: In general, it was dangerous for the Jews in the streets, because everybody could do with us as he pleased. That was but a small episode which I experienced shortly before my entrance into the Ghetto...Then...

00:08:47.314 --> 00:08:47.857
David Boder: Yes...

00:08:47.857 --> 00:09:05.490
Julian Weinberg: It was decided that we should go to the Ghetto of Lodz in an organized manner. For instance, every day a certain section of the city should be resettled.

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:06.315
David Boder: By the Germans?

00:09:06.315 --> 00:09:20.863
Julian Weinberg: By the Germans, yes. Where I lived...about...this section was to go first. And so...

00:09:20.863 --> 00:09:22.603
David Boder: Was that a better section.

00:09:22.603 --> 00:09:37.133
Julian Weinberg: And at 17 hours sharp [5 p.m.] our home was by the SS men...

00:09:37.133 --> 00:09:37.916
David Boder: surrounded?

00:09:37.916 --> 00:10:51.537
Julian Weinberg: . . . surrounded, and all the Jews had to abandon the city. The SS men entered the apartments directly, occupied by the Jews; have...have...gave us only five minutes time to leave the apartments instantly. And so everyone could take with him...only the least trifle of his possessions in a knapsack, and then step out into the yard. I had a peculiar incident happen with my son. He has a kind of an ‘Aryan’ look. So he was struck with a whip because he wanted to go with his father. The SS man did not believe that he was Jewish. And he thought that he wanted to smuggle himself away with the Jews. I had first to prove that...that he was my son, and so he was taken with us.

00:10:51.537 --> 00:10:55.043
David Boder: Now for what ‘lucky’ purpose would one want to smuggle himself away with the Jews?

00:10:55.043 --> 00:10:57.091
Julian Weinberg: Because he wanted to go with his parents.

00:10:57.091 --> 00:11:02.646
David Boder: That’s true. But how could an SS man think that anybody would intentionally [voluntarily] go to the Ghetto?

00:11:02.646 --> 00:11:18.863
Julian Weinberg: [His language becomes rather erratic] He [the SS] did not know. He might have thought that he was an ‘Aryan,’ you see? That by chance that was a boy—He was that time...about...about fifteen years old, you see?

00:11:18.863 --> 00:11:19.146
David Boder: Yes...

00:11:19.146 --> 00:11:25.411
Julian Weinberg: He was still young...young boy, you see? So he thought he may be up to some mischief. [Footnote 2: The SS often had trouble with children, Jewish and Christian alike. The ‘transports’ often looked like enticing adventures and young boys, not yet assigned for deportation, would join them not to be separated from a parent or, as if intending to become mascots in the lagers, which were pictured, at times, to the deportees, as most attractive installations. —D.P.B.]

00:11:25.411 --> 00:11:27.218
David Boder: Aha. Now...

00:11:27.218 --> 00:11:37.550
Julian Weinberg: Now, that was in the winter. It was freezing. We were again assembled in a yard.

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:38.225
David Boder: Yes...

00:11:38.225 --> 00:11:44.532
Julian Weinberg: All the Jews from the various houses of this region, this section...

00:11:44.532 --> 00:11:45.105
David Boder: Yes...

00:11:45.105 --> 00:11:54.816
Julian Weinberg: . . . were assembled, and we did not know exactly where they would lead...

00:11:54.816 --> 00:11:55.521
David Boder: . . . lead you?

00:11:55.521 --> 00:11:56.105
Julian Weinberg: lead us.

00:11:56.105 --> 00:12:04.720
David Boder: All right. Now tell me, Mr. Weinberg, I am, of course, eager to hear anything you say. But you have promised to give me only a half hour.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.184
Julian Weinberg: Yes.

00:12:05.184 --> 00:12:13.750
David Boder: And that is why I should like to come to other questions. How long were you in the Ghetto?

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:19.082
Julian Weinberg: I was in the Ghetto over five years. That is all the time [of the German occupation]. I only wanted to tell you briefly...

00:12:19.082 --> 00:12:20.359
David Boder: Yes. Please tell everything...[a few words not clear]

00:12:20.359 --> 00:12:33.733
Julian Weinberg: Afterwards...afterwards...how we went to the Ghetto. We learned...the same day...the same SS men...if they were not instantly admitted to an apartment...

00:12:33.733 --> 00:12:34.076
David Boder: Hm...

00:12:34.076 --> 00:12:36.125
Julian Weinberg: They would break down the doors...

00:12:36.125 --> 00:12:36.468
David Boder: Yes...

00:12:36.468 --> 00:12:40.535
Julian Weinberg: . . . and where there were sick who could not go with them...

00:12:40.535 --> 00:12:40.878
David Boder: Yes...

00:12:40.878 --> 00:12:43.740
Julian Weinberg: . . . they shot the sick people.

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:44.324
David Boder: Now how come [not clear—both talk together]

00:12:44.324 --> 00:12:48.752
Julian Weinberg: After we learned...

00:12:48.752 --> 00:12:48.993
David Boder: Yes...

00:12:48.993 --> 00:13:00.379
Julian Weinberg: . . . that they intended to drive people to the Ghetto by such means. So the following days all the Jews went to the Ghetto on their own.

00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:00.783
David Boder: Hm...

00:13:00.783 --> 00:13:47.147
Julian Weinberg: So, although it [the resettlement] was to last a week, all the Jews left the town on their own, because they have seen the inhuman methods with which the Jews were treated. And so we were taken to the Ghetto on foot; among us were many young girls, old women in bedslippers. Some were running even barefooted on the snow. En route we had to throw away the rucksacks because the burden was too heavy to carry.

00:13:47.147 --> 00:13:48.352
David Boder: Hm...

00:13:48.352 --> 00:14:01.008
Julian Weinberg: And so we arrived in the Ghetto. The Ghetto of Lodz was completely isolated from the city.

00:14:01.008 --> 00:14:02.014
David Boder: What was it?

00:14:02.014 --> 00:14:08.580
Julian Weinberg: There was absolutely no communication. It was surrounded with wire...

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:09.996
David Boder: But it was in the city?

00:14:09.996 --> 00:14:13.080
Julian Weinberg: It was on the outskirts of the city.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:13.412
David Boder: Yes...

00:14:13.412 --> 00:14:15.743
Julian Weinberg: They selected the suburb.

00:14:15.743 --> 00:14:17.039
David Boder: Yes...

00:14:17.039 --> 00:14:21.991
Julian Weinberg: A section...the worse section of the city.

00:14:21.991 --> 00:14:22.726
David Boder: Hm...

00:14:22.726 --> 00:15:45.001
Julian Weinberg: That was assigned to the Jews. It was surrounded with barbed wire, and strictly guarded by police guards; so that nobody may leave the Ghetto, and there were to be no communication with the city whatsoever...Yes...[Pause] at the beginning it was said...that...at the beginning people still lived...Everybody still had some money which he took with him...and some people had taken some food also, provisions. And one could manage the first few days. Afterwards there was formed a so-called Ghetto Council. This Ghetto Council was actually an outgrowth of the...of the City Council.

00:15:45.001 --> 00:15:49.019
David Boder: Yes. What did you say, a...?

00:15:49.019 --> 00:15:50.284
Julian Weinberg: . . . a branch...

00:15:50.284 --> 00:15:50.495
David Boder: Yes...

00:15:50.495 --> 00:15:53.519
Julian Weinberg: . . . a branch of the City Council.

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:55.115
David Boder: Yes...

00:15:55.115 --> 00:16:01.200
Julian Weinberg: At the head of the Ghetto Council stood the famous Bieburg.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.206
David Boder: Riebuck?

00:16:02.206 --> 00:16:03.441
Julian Weinberg: Bie-burg [?].

00:16:03.441 --> 00:16:04.236
David Boder: A Jew?

00:16:04.236 --> 00:16:08.845
Julian Weinberg: No. That was a German from Bremen.

00:16:08.845 --> 00:16:10.303
David Boder: Yes...

00:16:10.303 --> 00:16:11.460
Julian Weinberg: A businessman [ a merchant].

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:12.587
David Boder: How do you spell his name? [The enunciation of the name still appeared indistinct]

00:16:12.587 --> 00:16:14.888
Julian Weinberg: B...

00:16:14.888 --> 00:16:15.310
David Boder: Yes...

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:19.328
Julian Weinberg: i—e—b—o—w

00:16:19.328 --> 00:16:20.726
David Boder: Bielow [pronounced Bee-loff]?

00:16:20.726 --> 00:16:21.461
Julian Weinberg: Bielow.

00:16:21.461 --> 00:16:26.353
David Boder: Yes. Now then, he was a merchant from Bremen?

00:16:26.353 --> 00:16:41.847
Julian Weinberg: Yes. And he took over the whole management [council]. Now it was proclaimed that the Jews in the Ghetto had to work, otherwise they shall be unable to live. They were to earn their existence.

00:16:41.847 --> 00:16:43.937
David Boder: Yes...

00:16:43.937 --> 00:17:00.443
Julian Weinberg: Well, then there were created various shops [?], various outfits where the Jews were compelled to work. Let us say, a clothing shop...

00:17:00.443 --> 00:17:02.311
David Boder: Yes...

00:17:02.311 --> 00:18:11.609
Julian Weinberg: . . . where all kind of clothing was produced...the tailoring details. Then there were metal details, and electrical details, a rug detail, various...The people who had no...had no trade, had to reeducate themselves in order to do something. Naturally the Jews did not wish to work for the German power [state]. They were doing only a little bit in order to give an impression as if they were working. Otherwise we would have gotten no provisions from the Germans. However, Jewish labor was the cheapest as it was worthwhile for the people—the Germans—to create these various shops although the interestive work was not very interestive.

00:18:11.609 --> 00:18:13.717
David Boder: Although the work was not very intensive?

00:18:13.717 --> 00:18:13.989
Julian Weinberg: Yes.

00:18:13.989 --> 00:18:14.814
David Boder: Yes.

00:18:14.814 --> 00:18:53.664
Julian Weinberg: And it was not intensive because our Jews actually did not wish to work for the germans. It was a kind...a kind of silent sabotage against the Germans [Pause]. However, the Ghetto Council did good business in spite of that, because they were selling...They were selling the products that were manufactured in the Ghetto on the ‘Left’ market. For example...

00:18:53.664 --> 00:18:54.971
David Boder: On the black market?

00:18:54.971 --> 00:18:55.784
Julian Weinberg: . . . on the black market.

00:18:55.784 --> 00:18:58.044
David Boder: What did you call it, the ‘Left’...?

00:18:58.044 --> 00:18:59.954
Julian Weinberg: . . . the black market, it was...

00:18:59.954 --> 00:19:01.653
David Boder: But what was the other word for it?

00:19:01.653 --> 00:19:02.840
Julian Weinberg: ‘Left’ market.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.057
David Boder: Did they use that expression?

00:19:04.057 --> 00:19:06.177
Julian Weinberg: Yes. Some were [called it] ‘Left.’

00:19:06.177 --> 00:19:09.551
David Boder: Yes. That is all right, I just want to know it. Now then...

00:19:09.551 --> 00:19:15.949
Julian Weinberg: They sold on the ‘black’ without ration certificates,you see? Without certificates...[may also mean ‘purchase permits’].

00:19:15.949 --> 00:19:16.473
David Boder: Yes...

00:19:16.473 --> 00:19:25.901
Julian Weinberg: For instance...our wood detail.

00:19:25.901 --> 00:19:26.817
David Boder: Yes...

00:19:26.817 --> 00:19:31.528
Julian Weinberg: We constructed, for instance, very many pieces of furniture...

00:19:31.528 --> 00:19:32.444
David Boder: Yes...

00:19:32.444 --> 00:19:34.704
Julian Weinberg: . . . and little beds for children.

00:19:34.704 --> 00:19:35.198
David Boder: Hm...

00:19:35.198 --> 00:19:43.390
Julian Weinberg: These they could sell without [purchase] certificates, and that is why it was [one word not clear] worthwhile for me to manage these works for us.

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:48.312
David Boder: Hm...

00:19:48.312 --> 00:20:04.605
Julian Weinberg: To be sure. We were not getting any money, but only provisions, and very little. The best proof of it is that thousands of people were compelled to starve.

00:20:04.605 --> 00:20:05.930
David Boder: Now...

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:40.306
Julian Weinberg: Through the Lodz[?] Ghetto in excess of two hundred thousand people have passed. These were mostly Polish Jews; but there were also Jews from Germany, from Austria, and from Czechoslovakia brought also to the Lodz Ghetto, about fifteen thousand Jews.

00:20:40.306 --> 00:20:42.626
David Boder: Hm...

00:20:42.626 --> 00:21:00.078
Julian Weinberg: And these people were precisely the ones who were unable to adjust rapidly to the hard living conditions in the Ghetto. And it is possible to say that 90% of these Jews...

00:21:00.078 --> 00:21:00.692
David Boder: . . . who have come from abroad?

00:21:00.692 --> 00:21:48.406
Julian Weinberg: . . . who have come from the West were among those who were driven to death by starvation. Also the Polish Jews, especially the women, were neither able to stand the hard conditions, and many perished from hunger and various epidemic illnesses, such as spotted fever, intestinal typhus, and the like. Besides, these ‘normal’ [natural] cases of death, if that could be...

00:21:48.406 --> 00:21:49.382
David Boder: . . . called...?

00:21:49.382 --> 00:21:50.069
Julian Weinberg: . . . called ‘normal’...

00:21:50.069 --> 00:21:52.581
David Boder: Yes...

00:21:52.581 --> 00:23:13.726
Julian Weinberg: . . . There were these many deportations. It simply was said that the Germans were in need of people for various kinds of work. And so many people who were feeling bad in our Ghetto applied [for such work]. They thought that ‘outside’ it would be better. So they departed for work...but they never returned. Many deportations took place from our Ghetto, managed by the [word not clear], particularly by the Gestapo in coordination with the [name—word not clear] authority. These orders which were imparted to us arrived from Berlin. And so it was proclaimed that ten thousand people are to be deported—always it was said for work. But the people never returned. One ‘nice’ day they established in our Ghetto a so-called ‘passage [?] blockade!’...

00:23:13.726 --> 00:23:14.389
David Boder: Passage [?] blockade...?

00:23:14.389 --> 00:23:15.293
Julian Weinberg: Passage [?] blockade.

00:23:15.293 --> 00:23:15.757
David Boder: Yes...

00:23:15.757 --> 00:23:59.290
Julian Weinberg: . . . was established. And the SS men came...[word not clear]. All Jews had to assemble. They made a selection—who was to be evacuated and who was to remain. And so women and men who looked bad were embarked on carts and on trucks, and taken to assembly points. There came the so-called ‘roll-commando’ [transportation detail], ‘roll commando.’

00:23:59.290 --> 00:23:59.953
David Boder: Hm...

00:23:59.953 --> 00:24:09.031
Julian Weinberg: Those were SS men on heavy, large freight autos, with trailers. There all the Jews...

00:24:09.031 --> 00:24:11.471
David Boder: [A check on the German word] Anhänger means trailers, a second vehicle...

00:24:11.471 --> 00:24:42.659
Julian Weinberg: Yes, a second vehicle. There the people crowded into these autos and were removed. Also the hospitals were cleared of the gravely ill. The children were removed from the hospitals and from the homes, the childrens’ homes...

00:24:42.659 --> 00:24:43.394
David Boder: Yes...

00:24:43.394 --> 00:24:49.370
Julian Weinberg: Some of them were actually thrown on the autos, you see?

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:50.105
David Boder: Hm...

00:24:50.105 --> 00:24:54.966
Julian Weinberg: And in this manner all that was carted away.

00:24:54.966 --> 00:24:56.472
David Boder: Have you seen it yourself?

00:24:56.472 --> 00:25:21.085
Julian Weinberg: This I have seen myself. Yes...It is interesting that...that afterwards the clothes of these unfortunate people who were shipped away...these same old clothes were returned to the Ghetto. And so as later...

00:25:21.085 --> 00:25:23.646
David Boder: For what purpose?

00:25:23.646 --> 00:25:30.194
Julian Weinberg: These old pieces of clothing should be used by the Jews who had still remained, because...

00:25:30.194 --> 00:25:30.706
David Boder: [word not clear]

00:25:30.706 --> 00:26:28.483
Julian Weinberg: . . . We remained in the Ghetto for more than five years. Of these old pieces of clothing, of these old shoes which came back torn, because they were searching for various valuable...valuable objects [hidden] in the clothes; so the clothes were torn up, altered. The shoes as well. In our Ghetto the better things were repaired, and then partly distributed among the remaining population in the Ghetto, and partly it was also shipped out by the Germans for the bombed-out German population. [Pause]

00:26:28.483 --> 00:26:33.845
David Boder: Now then...And you spent five full years in the Ghetto?

00:26:33.845 --> 00:26:35.453
Julian Weinberg: Yes.

00:26:35.453 --> 00:26:39.068
David Boder: Did you participate in community [affairs/?

00:26:39.068 --> 00:26:49.682
Julian Weinberg: I participated but little in the community [affairs], because we had one elder of the Jews...

00:26:49.682 --> 00:26:50.225
David Boder: What was his name?

00:26:50.225 --> 00:26:53.611
Julian Weinberg: . . . He was very much on his own [overbearing]...Rumkowski. [Footnote 3: This name appears in several interviews, always in an unfavorable light. His role appears especially precarious in the deportation and alleged subsequent annihilation of several thousand Jewish children from the Lodz Ghetto. —D.P.B.]

00:26:53.611 --> 00:26:54.316
David Boder: What?

00:26:54.316 --> 00:26:55.443
Julian Weinberg: Rumkowski.

00:26:55.443 --> 00:26:57.323
David Boder: Yes. I have heard already that name from others.

00:26:57.323 --> 00:27:09.155
Julian Weinberg: Certainly. He received the orders directly...the orders from the Ghetto management, and he afterwards executed the orders...

00:27:09.155 --> 00:27:09.468
David Boder: Oh...

00:27:09.468 --> 00:27:15.733
Julian Weinberg: . . . as far as it was in his power. I did not want to participate directly.

00:27:15.733 --> 00:27:18.143
David Boder: Is he presently alive?

00:27:18.143 --> 00:27:31.559
Julian Weinberg: In these things, because I was opposed to the whole politics and I had to keep away from that whole business. Here...

00:27:31.559 --> 00:27:33.649
David Boder: Is Rumkowski still alive?

00:27:33.649 --> 00:27:36.210
Julian Weinberg: No, Rumkowski is not alive anymore.

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:36.734
David Boder: Who...

00:27:36.734 --> 00:28:28.210
Julian Weinberg: He was annihilated by the Germans in Auschwitz. And so the last evacuation took place in the month of August, 1944. At that time the Oberburgermeister of the city came and also the functionaries of the Ghetto management. They made speeches, they told us that now the whole [trend of] politics has changed in Germany. Germany needs workers by the hundreds; Germany was bombarded, many German cities have been annihilated. These cities must be rebuilt and therefore, also the Jewish labor must...

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:28.734
David Boder: . . . be used?

00:28:28.734 --> 00:28:48.855
Julian Weinberg: . . . be made use of. Then there was a commission of generals, all of...a military commission, and they have decided that Lodz is located near the front...

00:28:48.855 --> 00:28:50.253
David Boder: Yes...

00:28:50.253 --> 00:29:03.699
Julian Weinberg: . . . and it would not be right to keep so many Jews near the front. That was not right. They wanted to help the Jews...

00:29:03.699 --> 00:29:04.524
David Boder: Yes...

00:29:04.524 --> 00:29:31.039
Julian Weinberg: . . . so that they may not remain in the front zone, and therefore they have arranged [?] that we should leave, and we shall have better work, good living conditions and that they...have...with such...[he is here completely confused in search of the proper words]. Oh...

00:29:31.039 --> 00:29:37.738
David Boder: [Trying to guess the meaning] With such [apparent] frankmess

00:29:37.738 --> 00:29:38.473
Julian Weinberg: Yes...

00:29:38.473 --> 00:29:39.600
David Boder: [In English] sincerity?

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:43.407
Julian Weinberg: . . . frankness presented [the proper word would have been cunning, slyness] that the people...

00:29:43.407 --> 00:29:44.281
David Boder: . . . conviction?

00:29:44.281 --> 00:30:30.721
Julian Weinberg: Yes...That...they actually wanted to convince the people that...that they would have better work and better conditions. But what revealed itself [what actually happened ?], all the Jews were evacuated, not to the bombed-out cities, but everything [this pronoun refers, of course, to people; but like in so many other instances reflects the helplessness, the doom, the humiliation of the people concerned] went through Auschwitz—through the famous extermination camp. And there in Auschwitz the people were subjected again to a selection and most of them were compelled to pass through the crematories and there they ended their lives.

00:30:30.721 --> 00:30:32.360
David Boder: Were you in Auschwitz?

00:30:32.360 --> 00:31:01.360
Julian Weinberg: I was not in Auschwitz. I was...I remained among eight hundred and sixty people who were compelled to remain in the Ghetto of Lodz. That was a detail assembled by the Germans who were supposed to put the Ghetto in order.

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.336
David Boder: Hm...

00:31:02.336 --> 00:31:20.907
Julian Weinberg: Put in order [straighten up]; that means to assemble the pieces of furniture that have remained, the...all the pieces of clothing, pillows [?] [He badly searches for words]

00:31:20.907 --> 00:31:26.316
David Boder: . . . pillows and [In English:] bedding, [the confusion of the language by the interviewee obviously affects also the interviewer; like in the case of a normal individual talking to a stutterer—again in German] bedclothes.

00:31:26.316 --> 00:31:30.063
Julian Weinberg: . . . The bed...Yes, all the bedding.

00:31:30.063 --> 00:31:30.949
David Boder: Nu...

00:31:30.949 --> 00:32:21.364
Julian Weinberg: That lasted a few months. We...as the last seventy thousand people were taken to Auschwitz the Ghetto became greatly reduced, and we, the remaining eight hundred and sixty men and women...we were in two factory buildings [search for words] billetted?

00:32:21.364 --> 00:32:24.237
David Boder: . . . housed?

00:32:24.237 --> 00:32:27.009
Julian Weinberg: Yes. The men in one...

00:32:27.009 --> 00:32:27.172
David Boder: [Words not clear]

00:32:27.172 --> 00:32:30.437
Julian Weinberg: . . . in one factory building, and the women in another factory building.

00:32:30.437 --> 00:32:31.039
David Boder: Where was your son? [?]

00:32:31.039 --> 00:32:34.383
Julian Weinberg: That was...my son was with me.

00:32:34.383 --> 00:32:34.980
David Boder: Hm...

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:40.323
Julian Weinberg: And my wife and my daughter were...were...

00:32:40.323 --> 00:32:42.643
David Boder: On the other side...?

00:32:42.643 --> 00:32:43.920
Julian Weinberg: . . . on the other side. And so...

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.065
David Boder: Are they with you now?

00:32:45.065 --> 00:33:19.290
Julian Weinberg: Yes. We were housed directly in these two buildings—which have become some kind of lager, and from this instant we were regarded as a lager, like in Auschwitz, Dachau or the kind. We were subject to all disciplinary...

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:22.073
David Boder: All discipline...?

00:33:22.073 --> 00:33:24.272
Julian Weinberg: . . . all discipline...

00:33:24.272 --> 00:33:25.639
David Boder: . . . and rules...?

00:33:25.639 --> 00:33:40.399
Julian Weinberg: . . . and rules of the lagers. That meant, every morning we had to assemble on the yard for appell...

00:33:40.399 --> 00:33:41.164
David Boder: Yes.

00:33:41.164 --> 00:35:21.379
Julian Weinberg: Then the SS men would come. They assigned the people to various labor tasks. So this business dragged on until the 19th of September...January...until the 19th of January, 1945, on which date our city was...was liberated by the Russians and the then onmarching Polish armies. Now, during the last days, as we saw that the Russian offensive approached from Warsaw...You must know that we had a concealed radio also in the lager. We knew, therefore, approximately how the events stood. And so three days before the liberation of the city we all hid ourselves. We abandoned our lager and we hid ourselves within the Ghetto because it was...

00:35:21.379 --> 00:35:22.234
David Boder: guarded...?

00:35:22.234 --> 00:35:23.018
Julian Weinberg: . . . occupied by a police guard.

00:35:23.018 --> 00:35:24.355
David Boder: Was that not the lager police?

00:35:24.355 --> 00:37:09.343
Julian Weinberg: No [He uses the word ‘only’]. The lager proper had no German police guard, only the Ghetto as a whole. We got out of the lager at night and hid in various bunkers, in various buildings, in cellars, and in the attics of the buildings. I, personally, hid myself in a transformer station. That was a high tension room, where I have [hidden] my family. Altogether I hid there thirteen persons. And for that reason I remained alive. The Germans, as we learned later, had come into our yard and there they found, instead of eight hundred and sixty persons, only twenty-three individuals. They made a big ‘to-do,’ ‘Where are the others?’ The people were unable to give a reply. And they said, ‘Yes, they got out of the lager.’ And they arrested the twenty-three persons. They did not shoot them, only arrested them. And they decided to drag out of the apartments the rest of the eight hundred people who had hidden themselves, and then proceed with a general...

00:37:09.343 --> 00:37:09.855
David Boder: Execution.

00:37:09.855 --> 00:39:18.581
Julian Weinberg: . . . execution...[We know that] because they had dug with Jewish labor nine mass graves on the cemetery. We knew about that. And they intended to get us all out there and to annihilate us in these mass graves. [Footnote 4: The preposition in should stand although it is not sure whether it is correct in this particular case. During the occupation of Siberia by the Czechs it was reported that in one case (Omsk) they made the condemned men—about fifteen persons—first step into a shallow grave, fired a few random salvos, and then shoveled the earth over them without individual examination of the bodies for signs of life or coup de grace. —D.P.B.] And so the first day after they had arrested these twenty-three persons—there were about a hundred and twenty SS men with arms—they wanted to find us...The first day they were indeed able to find about seventy people, about seventy persons. They did not shoot them yet. They arrested them also, like the first twenty-three persons. And they came the next day...the next day they wanted to find the rest. Now they brought dogs with them. They wanted to find the people by means of dogs. The next day they found a few people again. All [were] arrested again. Another night went by and then they were compelled to abandon the city on the sly. And so the saved...the remaining people, who had stayed over in the Ghetto...

00:39:18.581 --> 00:39:20.340
David Boder: [Not clear]

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:33.232
Julian Weinberg: . . . have saved themselves in this manner, and also the people who were arrested were later set free by us.

00:39:33.232 --> 00:39:35.842
David Boder: One moment.

00:39:35.842 --> 00:39:44.091
David Boder: [In English] This ends Spool 49, a report by the engi—...[ends abruptly]
