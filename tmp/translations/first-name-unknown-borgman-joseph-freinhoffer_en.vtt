00:00:04.980 --> 00:01:01.167
David Boder: [In English] August 28, 1946. Geneva, at the school of the ORT. I shall try now to interview two instructors. [Unintelligible]...a good Russian name, that makes one homesick, and Mr. Joseph Freinhoffer. Eh, Mrs. Borgman is, eh, Mrs. Borgman is the secretary of the, eh, place and Mr. Freinhoffer is the chief of the, eh, shop.

00:01:01.167 --> 00:01:09.243
David Boder: [In German] So, Mr., eh, Freinhoffer. Can you tell me how long you’ve been working here at the ORT school?

00:01:09.243 --> 00:01:13.590
Joseph Freinhoffer: Since the beginning of May 1944.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.389
David Boder: You are Swiss, Mr. Freinhoffer?

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:16.735
Joseph Freinhoffer: That’s right.

00:01:16.735 --> 00:01:20.357
David Boder: And what was your job before you began your work here?

00:01:20.357 --> 00:01:24.570
Joseph Freinhoffer: I was a technical instructor at the vocational school, Zurich.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.067
David Boder: You are a trained technical instructor, then?

00:01:29.067 --> 00:01:34.470
Joseph Freinhoffer: A trained, eh, professional, that is, who further qualified himself as a technical instructor.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.468
David Boder: I see. Are these two different things in Switzerland?

00:01:39.468 --> 00:01:46.005
Joseph Freinhoffer: No, basically not. A technical instructor is made out of a good professional.

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:54.064
David Boder: I see. Now, tell me, eh, and, eh, Mrs. Borgman, how long have you been with the school?

00:01:54.064 --> 00:01:58.096
[first name unknown] Borgman: I have been here since August 15, 1944.

00:01:58.096 --> 00:02:01.144
David Boder: I see. How old is your school, then, altogether?

00:02:01.144 --> 00:02:04.223
Joseph Freinhoffer: The school opened its doors at the end of 1944.

00:02:04.223 --> 00:02:07.259
David Boder: I see. And it is an ORT school?

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.587
Joseph Freinhoffer: Yes.

00:02:08.587 --> 00:02:13.718
David Boder: Now, tell me Mr. Freinhoffer, how many boys do you have?

00:02:13.718 --> 00:02:16.211
Joseph Freinhoffer: We have thirty-six boys now.

00:02:16.211 --> 00:02:20.424
David Boder: Yes. You were also a teacher before you came here, weren’t you?

00:02:20.424 --> 00:02:22.809
Joseph Freinhoffer: That is, yes, at the vocational school Zurich.

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:34.326
David Boder: At the vocational school, Zurich. Tell me, do you find a difference between the students you had at the vocational school and the boys that you have here?

00:02:34.326 --> 00:02:54.958
Joseph Freinhoffer: I can only say that when it comes to effort, the stu—, the eh, students here, who have come out of the camps, work harder than those I have taught in Zurich, than those students who live with their parents and grew up in, eh, comfortable circumstances.

00:02:54.958 --> 00:03:19.181
David Boder: But tell me then, the boys were in circumstances that were entirely adverse. What idea do you have, what impact, what general impact did the concentration camp have on the character of the boys?

00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:44.934
Joseph Freinhoffer: These boys largely find that they have lost many years. That is why they see to it that they can progress quickly and, eh, learn a trade in order to become free men, in order to be able to earn their own bread and not be further dependent on, eh, organizations.

00:03:44.934 --> 00:03:50.448
David Boder: Now tell me then, they really feel that they have lost time?

00:03:50.448 --> 00:03:52.941
Joseph Freinhoffer: That’s right.

00:03:52.941 --> 00:04:02.859
David Boder: What’s the situation regarding the education of these boys? Are they able to read, to write? Have they nevertheless learned something in the camp?

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:28.549
Joseph Freinhoffer: Most of them had to leave school at age eleven to twelve and have not had a theoretical education since. As to on-the-job training, that was also very [unintelligible], since they only performed handy-man work at the machines and, eh, outside.

00:04:28.549 --> 00:04:43.446
David Boder: Tell me this, eh, what is your observation [unintelligible]? Some of the boys spent two, three years in Germany in several camps. Do they speak German?

00:04:43.446 --> 00:04:47.611
Joseph Freinhoffer: They all speak German but, eh, always bad German.

00:04:47.611 --> 00:04:48.517
David Boder: Yes?

00:04:48.517 --> 00:04:52.338
Joseph Freinhoffer: One can communicate with them, that is.

00:04:52.338 --> 00:04:55.646
David Boder: Yes, but you wouldn’t really call that German, would you?

00:04:55.646 --> 00:04:57.837
Joseph Freinhoffer: No, it is not good German.

00:04:57.837 --> 00:05:05.956
David Boder: Yes. For, you see, if some other young boy was in Germany, say, for two or three years he would have learned the language, wouldn’t he?

00:05:05.956 --> 00:05:20.642
Joseph Freinhoffer: Of course. He had, eh, they only had the opportunity to learn, eh, the language because they simply had to talk. They had to be able to talk and learned it in the process. Nobody helped them, though.

00:05:20.642 --> 00:05:22.332
David Boder: What do you say, Mrs. Borgman?

00:05:22.332 --> 00:05:26.256
[first name unknown] Borgman: In the camp, they were only among Jews, I think...

00:05:26.256 --> 00:05:26.757
David Boder: Yes?

00:05:26.757 --> 00:05:35.721
[first name unknown] Borgman: . . . and spoke Jewish. And Jewish actually is their native language, whether they are from Poland or Czechoslovakia or Romania...

00:05:35.721 --> 00:05:36.222
David Boder: Yes?

00:05:36.222 --> 00:05:39.331
[first name unknown] Borgman: . . . and so it developed into a kind of Jewish-German.

00:05:39.331 --> 00:05:46.291
David Boder: I see. Well, the “capos” were also [unintelligible]. Yes, and then, they never spoke much anyway.

00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:53.613
[first name unknown] Borgman: They weren’t to talk to the Germans at all. They only had to receive orders and answer with “yes” or “no.” You cannot learn German like that.

00:05:53.613 --> 00:06:18.167
David Boder: I see. Well, tell me this. I will ask you a question that I, to which I already know the answer. But anyways; eh, the boys that you have, how did they choose their subjects? Why did they come to your department and not, say, to the joinery?

00:06:18.167 --> 00:06:33.698
Joseph Freinhoffer: Well, a majority have already worked in factories. In Germany somewhere in the concentration camps and in ordnance factories, of course. But more than le—, more or less as handy-men.

00:06:33.698 --> 00:06:34.453
David Boder: Yes

00:06:34.453 --> 00:06:47.117
Joseph Freinhoffer: Of course they saw, eh, how the metal was worked with and that gave them [unintelligible] to work as free people and be able to learn, the job will be interesting.

00:06:47.117 --> 00:06:51.300
David Boder: I see. Do they have a talent for mechanics?

00:06:51.300 --> 00:07:02.497
Joseph Freinhoffer: The majority have a talent for mechanics. Those who work less precisely will [unintelligible], and they can still become good fitters, building fitters.

00:07:02.497 --> 00:07:19.105
David Boder: And, eh, how are the people here at school? Yesterday morning, I observed a class for the last few minutes. It was very interesting. How much theoretical education do the boys get here, then?

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:40.898
Joseph Freinhoffer: As regards theoretical education the boys are educated in drawing, arithmetic and occupational studies. Apart from occupational studies, which they have, eh, two hours a week, they have workshop studies. That is, on-the-job education they are given while they work.

00:07:40.898 --> 00:07:43.584
David Boder: I see. What do you understand by occupational studies?

00:07:43.584 --> 00:07:50.363
Joseph Freinhoffer: That is the theoretical knowledge that, eh, is related to the job.

00:07:50.363 --> 00:08:00.039
David Boder: But tell me, when the boys finish their training, will they be able to take a drawing and construct something according to that drawing? We call it “blueprint” [he uses the English word] in America.

00:08:00.039 --> 00:08:18.396
Joseph Freinhoffer: From the very beginning the boys have to learn to read a drawing and to work according to drawings. The small, eh, the simplest tasks of the basic curriculum are dictated and from this sketch, they are asked to work.

00:08:18.396 --> 00:08:31.012
David Boder: Tell me, at least in the beginning, how did you find the boys? [unintelligible] Were they quiet, were they friendly, and how are they now?

00:08:31.012 --> 00:09:03.175
Joseph Freinhoffer: They were, of course, different, depending on how they had been, eh, treated. Some were shy as deer. They didn’t dare come near anyone or talk. There were others that were more open. It was [unintelligible]. [Unintelligible] I cannot say that someone was. But they were simply very different in their, eh, freedom of movement and speech.

00:09:03.175 --> 00:09:07.841
David Boder: Tell me, are the boys honest?

00:09:07.841 --> 00:09:14.469
Joseph Freinhoffer: I believe they are honest. They have access to all tools...

00:09:14.469 --> 00:09:14.940
David Boder: Yes

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:32.976
Joseph Freinhoffer: . . . without strict control, that is, they’re only checked on from time to time. And I have to sa—, to say that nothing of ours and none of the tools that are in the, eh, workshop have disappeared so far.

00:09:32.976 --> 00:09:36.688
David Boder: Are the boys generally healthy?

00:09:36.688 --> 00:10:00.533
Joseph Freinhoffer: You, eh, they are, generally, you can say yes. But you can see the consequences of the concentration camps. One suffers from this, the other from that. Illnesses that boys who have grown up in a normal, a normal life don’t suffer from or less often.

00:10:00.533 --> 00:10:10.662
David Boder: Well, tell me, when the boys are done here, they will be, eh, what in this department?

00:10:10.662 --> 00:10:18.618
Joseph Freinhoffer: Those who are more talented will be machine fitters and the others building fitters.

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:19.028
David Boder: I see.

00:10:19.028 --> 00:10:41.151
Joseph Freinhoffer: Both groups can also learn how to weld. Gas fusion and electric welding, which is a great advantage. It is an advantage for machine fitters that they don’t enjoy anywhere else in another apprenticeship, and for building fitters it is, of course, an absolute necessity.

00:10:41.151 --> 00:10:55.960
David Boder: Tell me, if such a boy were to go to Brazil or to Argentina or wherever, could he set up a small workshop or would he have to work in a factory?

00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:24.541
Joseph Freinhoffer: When a student leaves school, then he is of course a young worker who is, of course, eh, not as independent as an experienced worker who has already gained a few years of practical experience. Vocational school education is not quite the same as vocational training in a workshop.

00:11:24.541 --> 00:11:32.768
David Boder: And most boys think that they will make it through these two-and-a-half years in [unintelligible], don’t they?

00:11:32.768 --> 00:11:34.730
Joseph Freinhoffer: That’s right, the majority.

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:39.348
David Boder: Are there any who have given up, who began here and went away?

00:11:39.348 --> 00:12:19.615
Joseph Freinhoffer: Previously, this used to be the case, because, eh, those were boys who had their parents and mostly didn’t go through the concentration camps. Who had their parents here in Switzerland or somewhere else or found them in the meantime and then drove off with them to other countries where the parents established themselves again. The boys that are here now are mostly without parents and, eh, have set their minds on learning the trade to be able to stand on their own two feet.

00:12:19.615 --> 00:12:35.058
David Boder: So, tell me, Mrs. Borgman, what would you add to this conver—, to this interview? How do you have with the boys, in what way do you come in contact with the boys?

00:12:35.058 --> 00:12:55.431
[first name unknown] Borgman: I see the boys here in my office when they have injured themselves. Then they come to me for treatment, when they need anything or if they desire anything, they come to me first and then I inform Mr. Freinhoffer. I also see the boys, because I give them lessons in French.

00:12:55.431 --> 00:12:58.920
David Boder: I see. How do they learn French?

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:17.107
[first name unknown] Borgman: Most of them are extraordinarily talented. They learn very quickly. But, I don’t know whether it’s because they, eh, suffered in the camp. They learn very quickly and they forget very quickly. They no longer have the memory.

00:13:17.107 --> 00:13:22.117
David Boder: And you’ve observed that they have no memory, no good memory?

00:13:22.117 --> 00:13:24.092
[first name unknown] Borgman: Not all but some of them...

00:13:24.092 --> 00:13:24.484
David Boder: [interrupts] Yes...

00:13:24.484 --> 00:13:26.114
[first name unknown] Borgman: . . . regarding practical work

00:13:26.114 --> 00:13:29.132
David Boder: [interrupts] But this could also occur at other schools, couldn’t it?

00:13:29.132 --> 00:13:32.965
[first name unknown] Borgman: Of course, I also have boys here who’ve gone to other schools...

00:13:32.965 --> 00:13:33.931
David Boder: Yes?

00:13:33.931 --> 00:13:48.086
[first name unknown] Borgman: . . . and I didn’t observe anything similar with them. These boys, on the other hand, are especially talented to do practical work. There are boys who arrived here four months ago and have already exceeded some students, regarding practical competence.

00:13:48.086 --> 00:13:53.985
David Boder: Yes, and? [The spool ends abruptly.]
