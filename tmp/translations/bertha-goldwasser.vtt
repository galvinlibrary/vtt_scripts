00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:33.997
David Boder: [In English] This is Spool number 24, taken the 4th of August, 1946, at 9 Rue de Patin, Paris. The interviewee is Mrs. Bertha Goldwasser, née Rosenstrauch, age 34. She is here in Paris and works with the Neue Freie Presse, a Jewish newspaper.

00:00:33.997 --> 00:00:41.981
David Boder: [In German] And so Mrs. Goldwasser, would you give us again your full name and [tell us] who you are?

00:00:41.981 --> 00:00:58.420
Bertha Goldwasser: My name is Goldwasser. Born in Poland. I was married here in Paris. My husband, his name was Kuba Goldwasser...who was deported in ’41, arrested by the German Gestapo.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.207
David Boder: In Paris?

00:00:59.207 --> 00:01:00.352
Bertha Goldwasser: In Paris.

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:04.774
David Boder: Tell me, Mrs. Goldwasser, where were you when the war began?

00:01:04.774 --> 00:01:24.014
Bertha Goldwasser: When the war began I was here in Paris, all the time, until the year...until the year ’41. On the day when my husband was arrested...and about the deportation I did not know. Fifteen days later I, too, was arrested together with my nine-months-old girl.In the spring of 1941, Vichy officials ordered the French police to round up mostly foreign-born Jewish men in Paris. Women and children were excluded at the time—Mrs. Goldwasser’s arrest was anomalous. Native-born French Jews had a much better chance of survival than did foreign-born Jews such as the Goldwassers.1

00:01:24.014 --> 00:01:33.143
David Boder: A little nearer here [to the microphone]. Yes? You were arrested with your nine-months-old baby.

00:01:33.143 --> 00:01:33.927
Bertha Goldwasser: Yes.

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:41.049
David Boder: Tell me, how was it here? You were living with your husband in Paris, is that right?

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:41.351
Bertha Goldwasser: Yes.

00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:42.801
David Boder: What was his occupation?

00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:45.195
Bertha Goldwasser: His occupation was...he was an engineer.

00:01:45.195 --> 00:01:46.143
David Boder: He was an engineer.

00:01:46.143 --> 00:01:47.151
Bertha Goldwasser: Engineer.

00:01:47.151 --> 00:01:48.818
David Boder: And did you have any other children?

00:01:48.818 --> 00:01:49.414
Bertha Goldwasser: No.

00:01:49.414 --> 00:01:50.780
David Boder: No. That was your...

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.214
Bertha Goldwasser: My only...my only baby...

00:01:53.214 --> 00:01:53.479
David Boder: Yes.

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:54.764
Bertha Goldwasser: . . . that I had.

00:01:54.764 --> 00:01:55.869
David Boder: Don’t you have the child any more?

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:18.302
Bertha Goldwasser: No. I had also been deported. And when I found out where the deportation was going, I jumped from the train with the child in my arms. And, God’s woe, my child was killed on the ground when I jumped down. And I, too, was very severely wounded, but some French [people] picked me up. [I was] with them nine months and was cured. And then...

00:02:18.302 --> 00:02:19.943
David Boder: Which French [people], those who were on the train?

00:02:19.943 --> 00:02:23.080
Bertha Goldwasser: No. Those on the ground. The French people who lived near the tracks.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:31.884
David Boder: Let us not go so fast, please. And so your husband was...was arrested. And what was done with him?

00:02:31.884 --> 00:02:35.790
Bertha Goldwasser: He was deported to Germany to work in the salt mines.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.784
David Boder: Yes. How was he arrested? Tell me the particulars of that occurrence.

00:02:40.784 --> 00:02:42.164
Bertha Goldwasser: I was arrested at home...

00:02:42.164 --> 00:02:43.282
David Boder: No, no, your husband.

00:02:43.282 --> 00:02:50.166
Bertha Goldwasser: My husband, too, was arrested at home. It was on the 26th of Aout—...

00:02:50.166 --> 00:02:50.742
David Boder: August.

00:02:50.742 --> 00:02:56.676
Bertha Goldwasser: . . . August, at nine o’clock in the morning. The Gestapo came into the house and asked for his name.

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:57.489
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:32.707
Bertha Goldwasser: And then they said, “Aha! You are a Jew! Then come. You are good for...for work in Germany.” My husband worked...[correction] answered, “Work does not scare me, but I would not like to go through the same things that my friends have already gone through in Germany.” So they took him by the neck and threw him down the stairs. And they said, “We will give you work indeed! You shall work a long time with us.” And then they deported him to Germany. They took him away to Drancy. And from Drancy they sent him to Pantin[?]

00:03:32.707 --> 00:03:34.283
David Boder: How do you know that? Did he write to you?

00:03:34.283 --> 00:03:44.156
Bertha Goldwasser: About that I received from the Germans themselves a ca—...a letter that the Jew...the Jew-prisoner Goldwasser is going to Germany as...as a volunteer worker.

00:03:44.156 --> 00:03:44.883
David Boder: As a volunteer?

00:03:44.883 --> 00:03:57.587
Bertha Goldwasser: As a volunteer worker. But it is not true, because they did this with all the Jews and Frenchmen. But they were not volunteers, because no Jew, no Frenchman reported to the Germans voluntarily.

00:03:57.587 --> 00:04:01.718
David Boder: Tell me, Mrs. Goldwasser, when were you given this paper?

00:04:01.718 --> 00:04:08.923
Bertha Goldwasser: This paper I received...I received in April...on the 11th of April.

00:04:08.923 --> 00:04:11.634
David Boder: He was taken in August...

00:04:11.634 --> 00:04:12.869
Bertha Goldwasser: In the year ’41.

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:13.231
David Boder: Yes. And on...

00:04:13.231 --> 00:04:13.351
Bertha Goldwasser: On the 11th of April...

00:04:13.351 --> 00:04:14.791
David Boder: The 11th of April...

00:04:14.791 --> 00:04:16.839
Bertha Goldwasser: . . . in the year ’41, I...She seems to be confusing the dates. It was in August 1941 that Mr. Goldwasser was incarcerated in Drancy.2

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:17.894
David Boder: Received this paper.

00:04:17.894 --> 00:04:19.063
Bertha Goldwasser: . . . received this paper.

00:04:19.063 --> 00:04:20.663
David Boder: Was it mailed to you or transmitted by hand [?]?

00:04:20.663 --> 00:04:22.169
Bertha Goldwasser: Sent by mail. [unintelligible]

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.234
David Boder: Notified[?] you by mail...

00:04:23.234 --> 00:04:23.429
Bertha Goldwasser: Yes.

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:26.867
David Boder: . . . that he had gone voluntarily to work in Germany.

00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:30.797
Bertha Goldwasser: Yes. And also...and on the bottom was added: The Jew-prisoner.

00:04:30.797 --> 00:04:35.942
David Boder: Yes. And so your husband had left, and you remained with the child.

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:37.071
Bertha Goldwasser: And I remained with the child.

00:04:37.071 --> 00:04:39.324
David Boder: And when were you arrested?

00:04:39.324 --> 00:04:42.185
Bertha Goldwasser: On the 16th of July in the year ’42.The Germans conducted a forcible round-up of Jews in the Paris region—including women and children and people with disabilities—on July 16-17, 1942. Some 9,000 French police were involved in this operation, during which over 12,000 persons (including 3,900 children) were arrested. They were soon taken to Drancy before being deported to Auschwitz.3

00:04:42.185 --> 00:04:44.494
David Boder: That was approximately a year later.

00:04:44.494 --> 00:04:45.287
Bertha Goldwasser: Yes, a year later.

00:04:45.287 --> 00:04:49.012
David Boder: Now wait a moment, please. Was the child born already when your husband left?

00:04:49.012 --> 00:04:50.247
Bertha Goldwasser: Yes. The child had already been born.

00:04:50.247 --> 00:04:52.682
David Boder: The child had already been born when your husband left?

00:04:52.682 --> 00:04:53.911
Bertha Goldwasser: When my husband left.

00:04:53.911 --> 00:04:55.421
David Boder: The child at that time was nine months old?

00:04:55.421 --> 00:04:57.027
Bertha Goldwasser: Nine...it was then nine months old.

00:04:57.027 --> 00:05:04.303
David Boder: Yes. And when you were arrested the child was already approximately a year and a half old or so? Isn’t that so?

00:05:04.303 --> 00:05:09.578
Bertha Goldwasser: Yes. No, it was thus. When my husband...when the child was nine months old I had already been arrested once.

00:05:09.578 --> 00:05:10.472
David Boder: Yes?

00:05:10.472 --> 00:05:15.667
Bertha Goldwasser: Because I had gone to the lager, and my husband...[I] threw in bread for my husband.

00:05:15.667 --> 00:05:16.986
David Boder: Oh. Nu?

00:05:16.986 --> 00:05:27.284
Bertha Goldwasser: So I was arrested then, the first time, together with the child. I had taken the child along. I believed that if I went with a child perhaps they would let me pass near [enter?] the lager.

00:05:27.284 --> 00:05:28.242
David Boder: Yes?

00:05:28.242 --> 00:05:30.776
Bertha Goldwasser: But it did not help, and the same as the others I was arrested.

00:05:30.776 --> 00:05:32.182
David Boder: Was that here in Paris?

00:05:32.182 --> 00:05:33.250
Bertha Goldwasser: In Drancy.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.451
David Boder: Yes.

00:05:33.451 --> 00:05:35.108
Bertha Goldwasser: A few kilometers outside of Paris.

00:05:35.108 --> 00:05:35.634
David Boder: Yes.

00:05:35.634 --> 00:05:36.548
Bertha Goldwasser: Not far.

00:05:36.548 --> 00:05:39.885
David Boder: So then you were...And how were you released?

00:05:39.885 --> 00:05:42.998
Bertha Goldwasser: And I was taken into Drancy, too.

00:05:42.998 --> 00:05:43.290
David Boder: Yes.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.423
Bertha Goldwasser: But my husband did not know about this.

00:05:45.423 --> 00:05:45.859
David Boder: Yes.

00:05:45.859 --> 00:05:49.156
Bertha Goldwasser: Then the French interceded, that [I] should...

00:05:49.156 --> 00:05:50.351
David Boder: Which French?

00:05:50.351 --> 00:05:54.783
Bertha Goldwasser: The French...the commandant of the French...of the lager.

00:05:54.783 --> 00:05:54.988
David Boder: Yes?

00:05:54.988 --> 00:05:56.779
Bertha Goldwasser: The French commandant of the lager...

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:57.181
David Boder: Yes?

00:05:57.181 --> 00:06:00.398
Bertha Goldwasser: . . . interceded, that I with the child should be released.

00:06:00.398 --> 00:06:00.663
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:00.663 --> 00:06:02.842
Bertha Goldwasser: I was released. And afterwards the police...

00:06:02.842 --> 00:06:04.543
David Boder: Why did he do that?

00:06:04.543 --> 00:06:12.572
Bertha Goldwasser: He took pity probably on the child. And he could not do otherwise. I was the first woman to get [into there] to be arrested at that time.

00:06:12.572 --> 00:06:13.409
David Boder: Yes?

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:14.443
Bertha Goldwasser: Yes.

00:06:14.443 --> 00:06:22.110
David Boder: [adjusting the equipment] Talk in this direction. So you were released, and you came home.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.208
Bertha Goldwasser: And I came home.

00:06:23.208 --> 00:06:25.126
David Boder: Where were you living then?

00:06:25.126 --> 00:06:30.126
Bertha Goldwasser: Not at the same address any more. I was not any more...At another...at a completely different location[?]

00:06:30.126 --> 00:06:30.883
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:30.883 --> 00:06:31.245
Bertha Goldwasser: I had...

00:06:31.245 --> 00:06:35.506
David Boder: Did you have to wear an arm band? Did you have to wear an insignia?

00:06:35.506 --> 00:06:38.940
Bertha Goldwasser: I had to wear a Magen David [Star of David] as they say...The edict mandating the obligatory wearing of the yellow star by all Jews in the German occupied zone was promulgated in May 1942. It provoked a good deal of discontent among the general French population.4

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:39.185
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:39.185 --> 00:06:41.217
Bertha Goldwasser: . . . with “Juive” [Jew] inscribed on it.

00:06:41.217 --> 00:06:41.789
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:46.659
Bertha Goldwasser: But I did not wear it, because I am not recognized too well as a Jewess.

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:47.141
David Boder: Yes?

00:06:47.141 --> 00:06:49.250
Bertha Goldwasser: I allowed myself not to wear it.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.700
David Boder: You took a chance, isn’t it so?

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:51.899
Bertha Goldwasser: I took a chance, yes.

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:54.313
David Boder: Yes. Nu, and thus you came home with the child.

00:06:54.313 --> 00:06:56.777
Bertha Goldwasser: And thus I came home with the child.

00:06:56.777 --> 00:07:00.626
David Boder: All right. Nu, what did you do then, did you work?

00:07:00.626 --> 00:07:02.534
Bertha Goldwasser: I then undertook to work...

00:07:02.534 --> 00:07:02.634
David Boder: Where?

00:07:02.634 --> 00:07:05.005
Bertha Goldwasser: . . . illegally. At dressmaking.

00:07:05.005 --> 00:07:06.853
David Boder: At dressmaking. Can you sew?

00:07:06.853 --> 00:07:08.865
Bertha Goldwasser: I can sew too, yes.

00:07:08.865 --> 00:07:16.040
David Boder: Yes. And how long did you work? And then you were working until you were again...arrested.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.747
Bertha Goldwasser: Until I was again arrested.

00:07:16.747 --> 00:07:19.793
David Boder: Tell [me] the particulars of this arrest.

00:07:19.793 --> 00:07:28.065
Bertha Goldwasser: I was...They came at four o’clock in the morning to my house, and they knocked.

00:07:28.065 --> 00:07:29.832
David Boder: At four o’clock in the morning?

00:07:29.832 --> 00:07:34.328
Bertha Goldwasser: At four o’clock in the morning they knocked. I did not answ—...answer.

00:07:34.328 --> 00:07:35.145
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:35.145 --> 00:07:38.900
Bertha Goldwasser: Then there was again...They broke in the door.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.422
David Boder: Yes?

00:07:39.422 --> 00:07:46.485
Bertha Goldwasser: But I had a window which led onto the...onto a roof of another house. I got out through that window and...

00:07:46.485 --> 00:07:48.242
David Boder: Were you dressed?

00:07:48.242 --> 00:07:50.740
Bertha Goldwasser: I dressed myself...I only put on a house coat.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.079
David Boder: Yes?

00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:57.310
Bertha Goldwasser: And I got out through that window and started to walk on the roofs...

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:57.682
David Boder: Yes?

00:07:57.682 --> 00:08:05.540
Bertha Goldwasser: . . . until I couldn’t any more. And they began to shoot at me. Then I had to surrender, no?

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:06.554
David Boder: With the child.

00:08:06.554 --> 00:08:20.081
Bertha Goldwasser: When I came down they already had the child. Because all the time since the first arrest, I did not have the child with me. My landlady kept the child.

00:08:20.081 --> 00:08:21.461
David Boder: Your landlady...

00:08:21.461 --> 00:08:23.011
Bertha Goldwasser: Kept the child.

00:08:23.011 --> 00:08:23.252
David Boder: Yes?

00:08:23.252 --> 00:08:32.317
Bertha Goldwasser: And when I came down they already had the child. And just the way I stood [in the same clothes] they took me to a lager.

00:08:32.317 --> 00:08:33.934
David Boder: And they gave you the child?

00:08:33.934 --> 00:08:36.207
Bertha Goldwasser: And they gave me the child, yes.

00:08:36.207 --> 00:08:36.569
David Boder: Yes.

00:08:36.569 --> 00:08:44.218
Bertha Goldwasser: It was in a big lager where hundreds...hundreds and thousands of women and children, men, too, were assembled together there.Those arrested in the infamous Paris round-up were at first packed for days without food, water or sanitary facilities in the Velodrome d’Hiver, a Paris sports arena.5

00:08:44.218 --> 00:08:45.085
David Boder: All Jews?

00:08:45.085 --> 00:08:56.071
Bertha Goldwasser: All Jews, only Jews. And then they began to sort [us] out, and the women with children were brought to Drancy.

00:08:56.071 --> 00:08:56.497
David Boder: Yes.

00:08:56.497 --> 00:09:03.630
Bertha Goldwasser: And there the children were taken away, and from all the deported the children were taken and deported separately.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:03.865
David Boder: Yes?

00:09:03.865 --> 00:09:08.899
Bertha Goldwasser: I...I...

00:09:08.899 --> 00:09:10.048
David Boder: You jumped off the train.

00:09:10.048 --> 00:09:23.302
Bertha Goldwasser: I got an idea. I asked the woman there...the German woman...She liked me, and she herself was married to a Jew. And she was...she had lived in France and knew me from before, too. Then she said...

00:09:23.302 --> 00:09:25.401
David Boder: She knew you? It was an acquaintance from Paris?

00:09:25.401 --> 00:09:33.559
Bertha Goldwasser: An acquaintance from Paris. She had lived here. But she wanted to save herself, so she said that she was a German, but she was Austrian, a Viennese...

00:09:33.559 --> 00:09:33.958
David Boder: Yes.

00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.482
Bertha Goldwasser: . . . and also a Jewess, a Mischling [a half-Jew].Mischlinge (lit. hybrid) were “half Jews” of the “first or second degree” defined by the Nazi Nuremberg Laws promulgated in the fall of 1935.6

00:09:36.482 --> 00:09:37.285
David Boder: Yes.

00:09:37.285 --> 00:10:03.255
Bertha Goldwasser: And she...she told me to go to the second RR-car. There are the children. And I should say that she sent me. Then I went into the second RR-car, and I had my child...and there I found my child. And thus we...There were other mothers, too. I do not know how...how they arranged to...to get to the children. When we got to the Colmar bord[er]...to Colmar, I jumped off the train.Mrs. Goldwasser’s transport held a portion of the 42,500 French Jews who were sent to “an unknown destination” in 1942. In fact, the destination was Auschwitz, where most of the deported were murdered upon arrival. This would have been the fate of Mrs. Goldwasser and her child had she not taken the bold and difficult act of escaping from the train.7

00:10:03.255 --> 00:10:06.318
David Boder: Now wait a moment, please. What sort of a RR-car was it?

00:10:06.318 --> 00:10:10.202
Bertha Goldwasser: It was a sealed RR-car, a completely locked RR-car for...for...

00:10:10.202 --> 00:10:12.324
David Boder: A freight car?

00:10:12.324 --> 00:10:15.086
Bertha Goldwasser: A RR-car for...for cattle.

00:10:15.086 --> 00:10:15.602
David Boder: For cattle.

00:10:15.602 --> 00:10:16.024
Bertha Goldwasser: For cattle.

00:10:16.024 --> 00:10:16.881
David Boder: A cattle car.

00:10:16.881 --> 00:10:17.414
Bertha Goldwasser: Yes.

00:10:17.414 --> 00:10:19.968
David Boder: So. And how could you jump off?

00:10:19.968 --> 00:10:24.084
Bertha Goldwasser: There were...there were three...les planches. How does one say it?

00:10:24.084 --> 00:10:24.570
David Boder: The boards were not tight [?]...

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:27.466
Bertha Goldwasser: The boards were separated, and in this way we...

00:10:27.466 --> 00:10:31.064
David Boder: Oh, that was a real cattle car.

00:10:31.064 --> 00:10:31.376
Bertha Goldwasser: A cattle car.

00:10:31.376 --> 00:10:31.892
David Boder: Because so cattle were transported...

00:10:31.892 --> 00:10:32.946
Bertha Goldwasser: [unintelligible]

00:10:32.946 --> 00:10:33.247
David Boder: Yes?

00:10:33.247 --> 00:10:44.197
Bertha Goldwasser: And then we...There was a...I took one...I do not know at all where I got the strength for it. I removed one board, and when I saw that the train was beginning to climb a hill...

00:10:44.197 --> 00:10:44.974
David Boder: Yes?

00:10:44.974 --> 00:10:47.113
Bertha Goldwasser: . . . I jumped off with the child.

00:10:47.113 --> 00:10:51.183
David Boder: Did anyone explain to you that it is better to jump when the train is going uphill?

00:10:51.183 --> 00:11:01.488
Bertha Goldwasser: No, no. I carried this idea already all the time. I told myself, “Once and for all. I am going to death, of course. And here I might be able to save my life...”The Germans did everything possible to keep their victims from knowing that their deportation would end in death. Somehow, Mrs. Goldwasser, perhaps instinctively, realized this and was moved to take desperate action.8

00:11:01.488 --> 00:11:02.054
David Boder: Yes?

00:11:02.054 --> 00:11:14.457
Bertha Goldwasser: . . . “and the child’s.” But, alas, I lost the child while jumping off. With my own...hands I had to gather the child...separate pieces of its body, and left it thus in the forest.

00:11:14.457 --> 00:11:15.833
David Boder: What does it mean, separate pieces?

00:11:15.833 --> 00:11:17.363
Bertha Goldwasser: A leg, a hand. I have...[Details possibly not entirely all correct. —D.P.B.]

00:11:17.363 --> 00:11:18.779
David Boder: Did that so...

00:11:18.779 --> 00:11:23.673
Bertha Goldwasser: Yes. When I jumped off, the train was going up the hill fast, up the hill.

00:11:23.673 --> 00:11:24.551
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:24.551 --> 00:11:43.686
Bertha Goldwasser: And thus I...I myself could...could not move ahead. And then two Frenchmen arrived from work. They asked me what I was doing here. I said that I am a Christian woman, and that the Germans had brought me here and had left me. I did not dare to tell the truth.

00:11:43.686 --> 00:11:45.423
David Boder: You did not tell them that you jumped off.

00:11:45.423 --> 00:11:46.216
Bertha Goldwasser: No.

00:11:46.216 --> 00:11:46.327
David Boder: No.

00:11:46.327 --> 00:11:47.044
Bertha Goldwasser: [unintelligible]

00:11:47.044 --> 00:11:48.905
David Boder: And was the body of the child still with you?

00:11:48.905 --> 00:11:50.763
Bertha Goldwasser: No. They saw already nothing [of the child]

00:11:50.763 --> 00:11:51.279
David Boder: You had buried the child.

00:11:51.279 --> 00:12:01.781
Bertha Goldwasser: I had buried [her] yes. And then came [unintelligible]. The people took me to them, and they...and they washed my wound, and I remained...

00:12:01.781 --> 00:12:03.157
David Boder: Where were you wounded?

00:12:03.157 --> 00:12:06.816
Bertha Goldwasser: My leg was broken in two places...was broken.

00:12:06.816 --> 00:12:07.171
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:07.171 --> 00:12:22.825
Bertha Goldwasser: The left leg, yes. And also my whole back was bruised. I could not lie down at all, nor walk, not even eat. But I was with those people. They were good [?]to me. They cured me.Mrs. Goldwasser was most fortunate in that the Frenchmen she encountered belonged to the Resistance. Some two-thirds of French Jewry survived in France, many due to help such as that offered to Mrs. Goldwasser. These rescuers came from all walks of life. Some were ideologically motivated. Others acted out of a conviction that a fellow human being in danger was deserving of help and compassion. Some of the rescuers knew those they helped and others were introduced to them by third parties. In Mrs. Goldwasser’s case, as with many others, help was provided spontaneously to strangers.9

00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:24.258
David Boder: Did they bring a doctor?

00:12:24.258 --> 00:12:26.280
Bertha Goldwasser: No, I did not want it, because I said [unintelligible].

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.730
David Boder: But how can one [handle] a broken leg...

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:32.981
Bertha Goldwasser: There was a...a clergyman. He did that for me.

00:12:32.981 --> 00:12:33.225
David Boder: A clergyman?

00:12:33.225 --> 00:12:33.621
Bertha Goldwasser: A clergyman.

00:12:33.621 --> 00:12:35.011
David Boder: He bandaged your leg.

00:12:35.011 --> 00:12:39.282
Bertha Goldwasser: Yes, bandaged. And thus I remained nine months with those people.

00:12:39.282 --> 00:12:46.084
David Boder: Tell me, please, if you got together with the clergyman, wasn’t he able to understand that you were Jewish?

00:12:46.084 --> 00:12:49.719
Bertha Goldwasser: But the clergy themselves here in France did very much for the Jews.Prior to the deportations of French Jewry, the French Catholic hierarchy did not protest against Vichy’s anti-Jewish measures—many supported the Vichy regime, which had abolished previous anti-clerical legislation and afforded new privileges to the Church. Following the deportations, the attitude of a number in the Church changed. Catholic clerics hid Jews in religious institutions, issued false baptismal certificates and helped Jews fleeing to neutral Switzerland. A number of French Protestants, themselves a small and often beleaguered minority, also became involved in Jewish rescue efforts.10

00:12:49.719 --> 00:12:49.924
David Boder: The clergy...

00:12:49.924 --> 00:12:56.896
Bertha Goldwasser: The clergy in France did very much for the Jews. They have...have hidden hundreds of children with them.

00:12:56.896 --> 00:12:57.583
David Boder: Yes?

00:12:57.583 --> 00:13:02.035
Bertha Goldwasser: Very many. The clergy, and also the...the sisters [nuns].

00:13:02.035 --> 00:13:02.441
David Boder: Yes?

00:13:02.441 --> 00:13:04.704
Bertha Goldwasser: They hid very many children here in France.

00:13:04.704 --> 00:13:06.300
David Boder: Then it was really true.

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.027
Bertha Goldwasser: True indeed. Just as I say.

00:13:08.027 --> 00:13:16.279
David Boder: Yes. I mean it was said so in America, and we have heard that the French clergy was [especially] good.

00:13:16.279 --> 00:13:17.165
Bertha Goldwasser: Very good.

00:13:17.165 --> 00:13:18.924
David Boder: Yes. So.

00:13:18.924 --> 00:13:45.782
Bertha Goldwasser: And then the clergyman started talking [with me] I saw that I could trust him, because I asked him once what was going on at the [battle] fronts [unintelligible]. And the people with whom I stayed belonged also to the French Resistance. They also worked against the enemy [?] against the Germans. [About two sentences unintelligible.]

00:13:45.782 --> 00:13:58.721
David Boder: And so they cared for you, and you got well. Where did you go then? [At least five or six sentences are unintelligible. Apparently the microphone connection during the interview got partially out of order. From the fragments of speech, one gathers that she discusses the Resistance. Then the recording becomes clear again. —D.P.B.]

00:13:58.721 --> 00:14:55.912
Bertha Goldwasser: . . . and so I returned home on false documents. I was in flight. And until liberation I joined the French Resistance and worked with them until the liberation of Paris.Although reliable statistics of Jews in the French Resistance movement are not available, there is little doubt that they were disproportionately represented in the French struggle against their German occupiers. They were found both in the general and the communist resistance. There was also a specifically Jewish resistance movement. It appears that Mrs. Goldwasser was in the general resistance movement, which was tied to the Free French Resistance under General Charles de Gaulle.11

00:14:55.912 --> 00:15:00.159
David Boder: Oh. Now tell me a bit about the work of the French Resistance.

00:15:00.159 --> 00:15:23.577
Bertha Goldwasser: The French Resistance worked very hard, and did...has done a lot for the Jews. When they learned...when they heard that Jews were being arrested they “sent” immediately and took the Jews into the forest. They were organized in a military manner, and we worked against the Germans.

00:15:23.577 --> 00:15:25.095
David Boder: What, for example, did you do?

00:15:25.095 --> 00:15:35.659
Bertha Goldwasser: We were after the [German] military. When a [German] military unit would pass, they [the Resistance] threw grenades, and they hampered in general their advance.

00:15:35.659 --> 00:15:37.225
David Boder: You hampered [?]...

00:15:37.225 --> 00:16:16.050
Bertha Goldwasser: Their advance. We also had aviators, American, Canadian, and English, who had been shot down, fell [parachuted] down. The planes were shot down. These people, the American aviators, when they were sick or wounded, we picked them up and brought them to the Spanish as well as to the Swiss border. I myself led twenty-four Canadian aviators to the Spanish border. And there I handed them over to other members of the Resistance and also to clergymen. They dressed them in different clothes and led them to Spain.

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:19.394
David Boder: And what happened in Spain? Were they interned or...?

00:16:19.394 --> 00:16:29.599
Bertha Goldwasser: In Spain they got in touch at once with the American consulate, and they went to Morocco, or to London.At the time, Spain controlled a portion of northern Morocco from the Atlantic to the Algerian border. On November 8, 1942, Allied forces launched successful landings in French Morocco and Algeria and by May 1943 had driven the Axis powers out of North Africa. These Allied successes encouraged neutral Spain to become more helpful to the Allied cause.12

00:16:29.599 --> 00:16:35.955
David Boder: Aha. And you yourself worked with these English, Canadian soldiers.

00:16:35.955 --> 00:16:36.961
Bertha Goldwasser: [unintelligible]

00:16:36.961 --> 00:16:38.828
David Boder: In what city was that?

00:16:38.828 --> 00:16:50.997
Bertha Goldwasser: I arrived with these twenty-four [men] at Toulouse. There the clergy would come and take over these people from me.Jules-Gerard Saliege, the partially paralyzed bishop of Toulouse, authored a ground-breaking pastoral letter on August 30, 1942 which called upon his French countrymen to stand up for the rights of French Jewry and resist the harm being done to them. This letter was read in the majority of churches in the diocese of Toulouse and sold secretly in Catholic book stores. It helped inspire the will to resistance among the Catholic clergy of the area.13

00:16:50.997 --> 00:16:53.708
David Boder: Yes. So the clergy was with the Resistance.

00:16:53.708 --> 00:16:57.533
Bertha Goldwasser: With the Resistance. Very many of the clergy.

00:16:57.533 --> 00:17:07.110
David Boder: Tell me, please, where were you...where were you when the liberation came?

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:16.640
Bertha Goldwasser: When the liberation came I was in Paris. I was also...I was as a lieutenant, as a lieutenant of the SEK [?] of the Resistance.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.333
David Boder: Yes?

00:17:17.333 --> 00:17:21.381
Bertha Goldwasser: And I was...and I was wounded in Paris for the second time.

00:17:21.381 --> 00:17:22.074
David Boder: How?

00:17:22.074 --> 00:18:03.798
Bertha Goldwasser: Because I had to pass through [a region] when the Germans retreated—so fast that one cannot imagine. And I wanted to get over to the other side [of the Seine?] in order to inform my comrades that they should hide from the Germans. They noticed it and fired. I was wounded in my leg, and twelve months...[correction] twelve weeks I was in a plaster cast with my leg. But afterwards I did...I got well very rapidly, and also my morale was quite different. And to this day I am working in the French Military Staff, that means in the Resistance, SEK [?] with the contingent of the Marseillaise.The battle for Paris between the French Resistance and the German army, marked by fierce and bitter street struggles, began on August 17, 1944 and ended with the arrival of the Leclerc division of the Free French forces on August 25 when the remaining German forces surrendered. The SEK portion of the resistance movement, Marseillaise contingent, has not been identified. However, it should not be confused with the SEC, the Vichy Jewish Affairs Commission intended to catch Jews contravening Vichy’s anti-Jewish edicts. It is not clear what type of work Mrs. Goldwasser was engaged in with the French military staff. Immediately after the war, resistance groups had a good deal of political power and played a considerable role in the government dominated by General de Gaulle.14

00:18:03.798 --> 00:18:07.364
David Boder: Oh, the Resistance [organization] still exists!

00:18:07.364 --> 00:18:09.834
Bertha Goldwasser: It was not disol—...dissolved [?]. It exists to this day [?].

00:18:09.834 --> 00:18:11.852
David Boder: And you...Go on.

00:18:11.852 --> 00:18:14.051
Bertha Goldwasser: Because they are recognized by the Military Staff.

00:18:14.051 --> 00:18:16.370
David Boder: And you are a member of the Resistance.

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:21.039
Bertha Goldwasser: I am a member of the Resistance, SEK, with the contingent of the Marseillaise.

00:18:21.039 --> 00:18:24.635
David Boder: Yes. So what are you doing now concerning the military?

00:18:24.635 --> 00:18:31.425
Bertha Goldwasser: Now they demobilized me, because I am already too old. [giggles] [unintelligible]

00:18:31.425 --> 00:18:34.509
David Boder: Oh. You are thirty-four and look twenty-eight.

00:18:34.509 --> 00:18:35.052
Bertha Goldwasser: But for the army...

00:18:35.052 --> 00:18:41.660
David Boder: If you are too old, then whom do they have in the Resistance, fifteen-year-old children?

00:18:41.660 --> 00:19:02.084
Bertha Goldwasser: No, women up to twenty-seven, twenty-eight. Because presently the women of the Resistance are going to Morocco. I did not want to go to Morocco, because I wanted to search for my brother whom I found in Lager Föhrenwald near Munich.Like most Jews who left Communist bloc countries after World War II, Mrs. Goldwasser’s brother was in an UNRRA camp. UNRRA was subordinate to the Allied military commands of each of the four zones of occupation. Munich and the surrounding area, including the Föhrenwald DP camp, were in the American zone. UNRRA’s task was to administer the Displaced Persons camps and to oversee the activities of volunteer welfare organizations.15

00:19:02.084 --> 00:19:04.554
David Boder: Now wait please. You have a brother?

00:19:04.554 --> 00:19:05.247
Bertha Goldwasser: Yes.

00:19:05.247 --> 00:19:08.560
David Boder: Where did he live during the war...when the war began?

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.392
Bertha Goldwasser: He was in Poland until ’40. And then...

00:19:11.392 --> 00:19:14.326
David Boder: Did you correspond with your family in Poland?

00:19:14.326 --> 00:19:20.995
Bertha Goldwasser: Until...my last letter...the last letter from the mother I received in ’42, in May...in May.

00:19:20.995 --> 00:19:23.748
David Boder: When did you leave Poland?

00:19:23.748 --> 00:19:26.128
Bertha Goldwasser: In ’36, on the 20th of June.

00:19:26.128 --> 00:19:27.736
David Boder: How come you left?

00:19:27.736 --> 00:19:29.965
Bertha Goldwasser: I went...I came here to study.

00:19:29.965 --> 00:19:30.688
David Boder: To Paris?

00:19:30.688 --> 00:19:31.020
Bertha Goldwasser: To Paris.

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:32.267
David Boder: What did you want to study here?

00:19:32.267 --> 00:19:36.647
Bertha Goldwasser: I wanted...I wanted to be trained as a chemical engineer.

00:19:36.647 --> 00:19:38.286
David Boder: You wanted to study as a chemical engineer?

00:19:38.286 --> 00:19:39.202
Bertha Goldwasser: To study chemical engineering.

00:19:39.202 --> 00:19:41.142
David Boder: Where did you finish the Gymnasium?

00:19:41.142 --> 00:19:44.287
Bertha Goldwasser: In Poland, in Barysz [?]. There I graduated.

00:19:44.287 --> 00:19:45.895
David Boder: There you graduated.

00:19:45.895 --> 00:19:47.160
Bertha Goldwasser: Graduated.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.624
David Boder: And then you came here to study chemical engineering. Where?

00:19:50.624 --> 00:19:51.781
Bertha Goldwasser: In Paris.

00:19:51.781 --> 00:19:52.775
David Boder: In which school?

00:19:52.775 --> 00:19:56.360
Bertha Goldwasser: In Faculte de...in Faculte de...in Faculte des Docteurs. [unintelligible; sounds like “Bue”]

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.149
David Boder: Did you begin your studies?

00:19:58.149 --> 00:20:09.595
Bertha Goldwasser: I beg—...I enrolled but did not begin. My mother was not rich enough to support me. And I myself did not know the language, so I was not able to go that far.

00:20:09.595 --> 00:20:10.209
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:18.372
Bertha Goldwasser: So then I...I began to give Polish lessons, and I myself was learning French.

00:20:18.372 --> 00:20:20.481
David Boder: Who wanted to learn Polish here?

00:20:20.481 --> 00:20:26.487
Bertha Goldwasser: There were...there were colonies of Polish workers who were working here in coal mines.

00:20:26.487 --> 00:20:26.879
David Boder: Here?

00:20:26.879 --> 00:20:27.674
Bertha Goldwasser: Here in France.

00:20:27.674 --> 00:20:28.849
David Boder: And they wanted to learn Polish?

00:20:28.849 --> 00:20:33.861
Bertha Goldwasser: Yes. They had children here [unintelligible].

00:20:33.861 --> 00:20:36.783
David Boder: Aha. And these colonists wanted their children to learn Polish.

00:20:36.783 --> 00:20:39.054
Bertha Goldwasser: Polish, yes. They were Poles, of course.

00:20:39.054 --> 00:20:41.946
David Boder: Yes. And when did you get married?

00:20:41.946 --> 00:20:43.585
Bertha Goldwasser: In ’38.

00:20:43.585 --> 00:20:44.139
David Boder: Here in...

00:20:44.139 --> 00:20:45.103
Bertha Goldwasser: Here in Paris.

00:20:45.103 --> 00:20:45.886
David Boder: Here in Paris.

00:20:45.886 --> 00:20:46.519
Bertha Goldwasser: Yes.

00:20:46.519 --> 00:20:52.344
David Boder: Now tell me...And then you...and you had...How large was your family in Poland?

00:20:52.344 --> 00:20:56.488
Bertha Goldwasser: In Poland I had my mother and my brother.

00:20:56.488 --> 00:20:57.436
David Boder: And the father?

00:20:57.436 --> 00:21:01.034
Bertha Goldwasser: The father had died a long time ago, when I was a child four years old.

00:21:01.034 --> 00:21:01.295
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:01.295 --> 00:21:12.247
Bertha Goldwasser: When I left my brother, he was fifteen years old. And I also had uncles, aunts, my mother’s brothers and sisters...[her] brothers- and sisters-in-law with children.

00:21:12.247 --> 00:21:12.773
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:12.773 --> 00:21:15.143
Bertha Goldwasser: But in America I have two aunts.

00:21:15.143 --> 00:21:15.910
David Boder: Two aunts?

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:16.292
Bertha Goldwasser: Yes.

00:21:16.292 --> 00:21:21.186
David Boder: Now let us first finish with the Polish relatives. When was the last time you heard from your mother?

00:21:21.186 --> 00:21:25.598
Bertha Goldwasser: From my mother I have [heard] in ’42. In May I received the last letter.

00:21:25.598 --> 00:21:26.787
David Boder: Where was she then?

00:21:26.787 --> 00:21:28.869
Bertha Goldwasser: She was in Barysz [?] at home.

00:21:28.869 --> 00:21:32.444
David Boder: Yes. And what...How did your mother get along?

00:21:32.444 --> 00:21:56.100
Bertha Goldwasser: Before the war my mother was rather well off, but afterwards, like all the others, they took everything away from her, drove her out [of her house] put [her] into a ghetto like all the other Jews. And there probably she was very badly treated, beaten. And the old ones were even taken to the gas chambers. I was told that. In the gas chambers they were asphyxiated.

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.911
David Boder: But what happened to your mother?

00:21:57.911 --> 00:22:01.606
Bertha Goldwasser: My mother was taken to Treblinka to a...

00:22:01.606 --> 00:22:02.570
David Boder: Treblinka?

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:07.464
Bertha Goldwasser: Treblinka...to a lager. And there he was gassed in a gas [unintelligible].

00:22:07.464 --> 00:22:08.749
David Boder: Who told you that?

00:22:08.749 --> 00:22:37.162
Bertha Goldwasser: My brother told me that. He had remained...He was drafted [?] by the Russians. That was in Poland. Then, when the Russians withdrew, he went with them to Russia. And there he joined the Russian army, and...and he was a soldier. He was wounded three times. He has fought...fought on the borders of East Prussia, under the command of a Jewish general. In keeping with the August 1939 Stalin-Hitler pact, the Russians occupied eastern Poland after the outbreak of World War II and drafted Mrs. Goldwasser’s brother into the Red Army. In June 1941, following the invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany, the Red Army withdrew and her brother went with it. Some half a million Jews fought in the Red Army during World War II. Approximately 120,000 lost their lives, and thousands more, including Mrs. Goldwasser’s brother, were wounded.16

00:22:37.162 --> 00:22:38.276
David Boder: Who was that?

00:22:38.276 --> 00:22:39.632
Bertha Goldwasser: In...

00:22:39.632 --> 00:22:41.242
David Boder: Was this the general who was killed?

00:22:41.242 --> 00:22:41.895
Bertha Goldwasser: Who was killed.

00:22:41.895 --> 00:22:42.427
David Boder: Yurenko?

00:22:42.427 --> 00:22:46.283
Bertha Goldwasser: Yur—...no, not Yurenko.

00:22:46.283 --> 00:22:48.205
David Boder: Yes, in northeastern Prussia.

00:22:48.205 --> 00:22:49.364
Bertha Goldwasser: In northeastern Prussia.

00:22:49.364 --> 00:22:49.599
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:49.599 --> 00:23:53.775
Bertha Goldwasser: He [my brother] was wounded. And then he was taken to Moscow, and [there] he recovered. Afterwards...he had it very good in Russia. This he wrote me. And then he thought, what should he do there all alone. He is still “a child.” He thought perhaps he will find...perhaps he will yet find the mother. So he came home, to Poland, to Barysz [?]. And he did not find the mother, no one. So he went on to Poland...he went to Poland. And he found no one of the family. So he came to Germany. In Germany he found no one either. Then he went on to Munich and...and joined a lager of the UNRRA. There he decided to go either to America or to Palestine. But when he received word from my aunt in America, and when she also gave him my address, he immediately wrote to me in France, and now I am in contact with him.

00:23:53.775 --> 00:23:54.599
David Boder: Where is the brother?

00:23:54.599 --> 00:23:58.730
Bertha Goldwasser: My brother is in Mun—...near Munich, in Föhrenwald, in a camp.

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:02.268
David Boder: In a camp, and...and he corresponds with you.

00:24:02.268 --> 00:24:02.379
Bertha Goldwasser: Yes.

00:24:02.379 --> 00:24:04.150
David Boder: Why doesn’t he come to Paris?

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:08.919
Bertha Goldwasser: Because I myself do not know what to do in Paris. Perhaps he...

00:24:08.919 --> 00:24:09.351
David Boder: How old is he now?

00:24:09.351 --> 00:24:13.482
Bertha Goldwasser: He is now twenty-four years old, going on twenty-five.

00:24:13.482 --> 00:24:13.948
David Boder: Yes.

00:24:13.948 --> 00:24:25.723
Bertha Goldwasser: And so myself do not know what to do. To take him to Paris? I am alone. I perhaps can create a future for myself [?] and from America...the aunts want to take him over to America.

00:24:25.723 --> 00:24:26.988
David Boder: The aunts want to take him over to America.

00:24:26.988 --> 00:24:29.729
Bertha Goldwasser: Yes. They have sent him an affidavit.The affidavit was a sworn assurance by family or friends of those who sought to be admitted to the United States that they had the financial means to care for the would-be immigrant and that he or she was at no risk to become “a public charge.”17

00:24:29.729 --> 00:24:32.375
David Boder: Tell me, please, where do your aunts live?

00:24:32.375 --> 00:24:34.417
Bertha Goldwasser: My aunt lives in Brooklyn.

00:24:34.417 --> 00:24:35.622
David Boder: In Brooklyn, near New York.

00:24:35.622 --> 00:24:36.690
Bertha Goldwasser: New York.

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:38.156
David Boder: And what are their names?

00:24:38.156 --> 00:24:39.763
Bertha Goldwasser: Rosa Drah [?].

00:24:39.763 --> 00:24:40.048
David Boder: Rosa...

00:24:40.048 --> 00:24:43.763
Bertha Goldwasser: Rosa Kupferstein and Anna Drah [?].

00:24:43.763 --> 00:24:44.777
David Boder: Kupferstein?

00:24:44.777 --> 00:24:46.223
Bertha Goldwasser: Kupferstein.

00:24:46.223 --> 00:24:47.271
David Boder: And Anna Drah.

00:24:47.271 --> 00:24:48.586
Bertha Goldwasser: And Anna Drah.

00:24:48.586 --> 00:24:49.771
David Boder: Both in Brooklyn.

00:24:49.771 --> 00:24:50.996
Bertha Goldwasser: Both in Brooklyn.

00:24:50.996 --> 00:24:53.365
David Boder: Do you also have their telephone numbers, or just their addresses?

00:24:53.365 --> 00:24:55.171
Bertha Goldwasser: I have the addresses, just the addresses.

00:24:55.171 --> 00:24:56.376
David Boder: You have just the addresses.

00:24:56.376 --> 00:25:01.942
Bertha Goldwasser: Just the addresses, yes. And they have also sent me an affidavit. They also want me to come to America.

00:25:01.942 --> 00:25:02.695
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:02.695 --> 00:25:11.240
Bertha Goldwasser: But unfortunately I am Polish, and the quota for Poles is a very “tedious” one. It may take very long.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:14.216
David Boder: Yes. But you were a student here?

00:25:14.216 --> 00:25:15.626
Bertha Goldwasser: Yes, I was a student.

00:25:15.626 --> 00:25:16.453
David Boder: You were a student.

00:25:16.453 --> 00:25:16.895
Bertha Goldwasser: Yes.

00:25:16.895 --> 00:25:19.636
David Boder: Do you have a diploma showing that you have graduated [from the Gymnasium]?

00:25:19.636 --> 00:25:24.684
Bertha Goldwasser: Yes. But unfortunately I have nothing [to show] because the Germans took everything away from me. I cannot get another one.

00:25:24.684 --> 00:25:28.038
David Boder: Is it recorded at the university that you had been there?

00:25:28.038 --> 00:25:30.191
Bertha Goldwasser: It was...yes, it is recorded.

00:25:30.191 --> 00:25:32.765
David Boder: Then you can get a certificate from the university.

00:25:32.765 --> 00:25:34.362
Bertha Goldwasser: I can get a certificate, of course.

00:25:34.362 --> 00:25:36.264
David Boder: Yes. That should be sufficient.

00:25:36.264 --> 00:25:37.152
Bertha Goldwasser: Yes.

00:25:37.152 --> 00:25:42.929
David Boder: So. Tell me, please, did the Maquis have any poems, any songs?

00:25:42.929 --> 00:25:45.049
Bertha Goldwasser: Yes, they created very beautiful songs.

00:25:45.049 --> 00:25:47.904
David Boder: Would you perhaps sing one for me?

00:25:47.904 --> 00:25:50.886
Bertha Goldwasser: [chuckle] [unintelligible] I can’t sing. I have no voice.

00:25:50.886 --> 00:25:56.621
David Boder: You may do it in a very low voice. The important thing is that the words be clear. Right?

00:25:56.621 --> 00:25:58.683
Bertha Goldwasser: Yes.

00:25:58.683 --> 00:26:01.314
David Boder: Just hum it, so to speak. Try, please.

00:26:01.314 --> 00:26:02.864
Bertha Goldwasser: I cannot remember.

00:26:02.864 --> 00:26:04.702
David Boder: Try, please. Let us see.

00:26:04.702 --> 00:26:05.612
Bertha Goldwasser: [In French] [unintelligible]? [sings] Friends, you heard the glory of liberty, which has called you. Come to the ranks [unintelligible] stretch out your hand to your brothers, who agree with you [feel like you] [unintelligible; “to fight against”?] be it those who abandoned the legions [ranks] be it those who abandoned the nations. Friends, you hear the glory which is calling you. On the hills is liberty, which will unite you, comrades, Jews, Italians [unintelligible].

00:26:05.612 --> 00:26:10.861
David Boder: [In German] Yes. Do you know any Jewish songs from the lagers?

00:26:10.861 --> 00:26:12.077
Bertha Goldwasser: From the lagers? Yes.

00:26:12.077 --> 00:26:14.296
David Boder: Yes. Will you please sing one for me?

00:26:14.296 --> 00:26:17.212
Bertha Goldwasser: But I myself was not in the lager. These are songs which we have had come to us [?].

00:26:17.212 --> 00:26:19.023
David Boder: Yes. Will you sing one?

00:26:19.023 --> 00:26:56.139
Bertha Goldwasser: [recites] “[The first line is not clear] Ravensbrück, Ravensbrück, you are in the abyss [?]. And perhaps one day we will see freedom. Then we shall say to life once again, yes, Ravensbrück, you are the past, the sorrow, the destruction, by the Germans, by the Nazis, of the Jewish people. We the young have faith in life [?]. One must strive to live. But the Germans have besmirched this striving with black ink.” There are some more words, but I do not remember them.

00:26:56.139 --> 00:26:58.964
David Boder: Recite please in French.

00:26:58.964 --> 00:27:31.679
Bertha Goldwasser: [She recites another song in French.]

00:27:31.679 --> 00:27:42.701
Bertha Goldwasser: [In German] There are some more words to this too, but I do not remember them.

00:27:42.701 --> 00:27:48.508
David Boder: Well, tell me, what do you think in general? What will become of the future?

00:27:48.508 --> 00:27:49.537
Bertha Goldwasser: About the future?

00:27:49.537 --> 00:27:50.856
David Boder: [adjusts the equipment]

00:27:50.856 --> 00:29:38.096
Bertha Goldwasser: . . . when one is able to talk about the future it is [appears] very beautiful. But we cannot imagine at all what the future will look like. The Polish Jews had been very much oppressed. They have absolutely no “moral instinct.” They have absolutely no...no hope to live. They want to wander. They want to run. To Palestine, unfortunately, they are not admitted. England does not want to give any certificates. To America one is unable [to go]. People have affidavits, but the quota is blocked. Well, what should the Jews do? Where should they go? They have no homeland. They want to have a national homeland. They want to be Palestinian citizens. And why should we not be? And so, unfortunately, no...I cannot imagine at all how life...the problem of the Jewish life in general, all over the world, will...will not take shape. It is a question. We are at the start of a world conference. Perhaps they will talk about us, too. Who knows? The Jews in general...a European Jew is not...is not too well at the moment. I mean morally. He has no homeland. He has no, as one says in Yiddish, roof over his head. And what can he do? He is broken up. No family. And out of a family, out of the most beautiful families, not a single person was left. And out of many hundreds and millions not even one has remained. What can one...Mrs. Goldwasser was indeed among those who lost almost their entire family including her mother, her husband, her baby daughter and her aunts, uncles and cousins.18

00:29:38.096 --> 00:29:43.237
David Boder: For which paper do you work, here in Paris?

00:29:43.237 --> 00:29:52.307
Bertha Goldwasser: I? For the Neue...Neue Presse. This is a paper which naturally defends the working class.

00:29:52.307 --> 00:29:58.060
David Boder: Aha. How many...how many Jewish papers are there in Paris?

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:17.803
Bertha Goldwasser: There are many Jewish papers, but not all...not all of the same opinion. There are Zionist papers. There are socialist, so-called Bundist [an old, Jewish socialist party founded in Czarist Russia] papers. They are the worst, because they are against...against the progressive labor movement.The Bund was opposed to the communist labor movement. It was a socialist movement that aimed to seek Jewish cultural autonomy in a democratic state. It favored the Yiddish language.19

00:30:17.803 --> 00:30:19.419
David Boder: The Bundist papers?

00:30:19.419 --> 00:30:21.190
Bertha Goldwasser: [They] take always the stand...

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:21.742
David Boder: Yes?

00:30:21.742 --> 00:30:31.682
Bertha Goldwasser: The Bundist paper always takes the opposite stand, against the Neue Presse. This is a struggle between two camps of labor.

00:30:31.682 --> 00:30:36.210
David Boder: Is the Bundist press not a socialist press, not a Social-Democratic press?

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:45.394
Bertha Goldwasser: A Social-Democratic [paper] as it is said, but in reality they are not the way the worker wants to have it.

00:30:45.394 --> 00:30:46.372
David Boder: You think so?

00:30:46.372 --> 00:30:48.374
Bertha Goldwasser: That is what I think.

00:30:48.374 --> 00:30:51.948
David Boder: But there are many people who read this paper. Isn’t that so?

00:30:51.948 --> 00:30:58.151
Bertha Goldwasser: There are, but it does not have too much of a success [following] I am not talking now as a follower of the Neue Presse...

00:30:58.151 --> 00:30:58.533
David Boder: Yes?

00:30:58.533 --> 00:31:01.831
Bertha Goldwasser: . . . which has a tremendous success.

00:31:01.831 --> 00:31:08.912
Bertha Goldwasser: [In Yiddish] When one comes to a Jewish home, in every Jewish family, in the morning one sees a Jewish newspaper.

00:31:08.912 --> 00:31:23.101
Bertha Goldwasser: [In German] This is the Neue Presse, naturally. As one sees a French newspaper, a working man’s paper, or any other one, but the...but the Jew, he reads the...the Neue Presse.

00:31:23.101 --> 00:31:23.877
David Boder: The Neue Presse.

00:31:23.877 --> 00:31:24.293
Bertha Goldwasser: Because in it he has...

00:31:24.293 --> 00:31:26.707
David Boder: Is the Neue Presse Zionistic?

00:31:26.707 --> 00:31:46.619
Bertha Goldwasser: The Neue Presse is not Zionistic. The Neue Presse is a...not communistic, but it defends the Jewish immigrant, defends the Jewish [unintelligible] man, the worker who works at home, who works in the factories, and the intellectuals who...The Neue Presse (also known as Neie Presse or Naie Presse) was a Yiddish language daily newspaper with pronounced communist leanings. Like the Bund, it was anti-Zionist, but was more universalistic in outlook.20

00:31:46.619 --> 00:31:48.611
David Boder: What does it say about Palestine?

00:31:48.611 --> 00:31:52.762
Bertha Goldwasser: About Palestine? What does it say about Palestine?

00:31:52.762 --> 00:31:53.499
David Boder: Yes.

00:31:53.499 --> 00:32:16.562
Bertha Goldwasser: They have a very strong [?] opinion about Palestine. They help in Palestine the Jews who organize in Palestine against the...against the bourgeois camp [class] who want to create their own homeland, who want something too...

00:32:16.562 --> 00:32:18.025
David Boder: I thank you very much, Mrs. Goldwasser. This is a very good...[mid-sentence interruption of interview apparently due to the end of the spool]
