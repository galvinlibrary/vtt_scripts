00:00:02.243 --> 00:00:40.160
David Boder: [In English] France. September the 13th, 1946, at Henonville, fifty kilometers from Paris, in a home for displaced Jews which consists of a large Kibbutz and also of a Lithuanian Yeshiva which is here temporarily. And the person to be interviewed is Mrs. Hadassah Marcus, tattoo number 48543 and a triangle.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.545
David Boder: [In Yiddish] And so, Mrs. Marcus, tell us again your name and where you are from.

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:51.459
Hadassah Marcus: My name is Hadassah Marcus, born in Warsaw and all my years [I] have spent in Warsaw.

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:54.638
David Boder: Now, Mrs. Marcus, how old are you now?

00:00:54.638 --> 00:00:57.247
Hadassah Marcus: I am thirty-two years old.

00:00:57.247 --> 00:00:58.215
David Boder: Thirty-two years.

00:00:58.215 --> 00:00:58.626
Hadassah Marcus: Yes.

00:00:58.626 --> 00:01:00.326
David Boder: Do you have a family?

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:02.164
Hadassah Marcus: [With emphasis] I have no family.

00:01:02.164 --> 00:01:03.671
David Boder: Your husband is not with you?

00:01:03.671 --> 00:01:06.148
Hadassah Marcus: My husband isn’t with me for a long time.

00:01:06.148 --> 00:01:07.709
David Boder: And you are alone here in the Kibbutz?

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:09.375
Hadassah Marcus: I [am] alone in the Kibbutz.

00:01:09.375 --> 00:01:18.562
David Boder: And so. Nu, Mrs. Marcus, would you tell me where you were and what happened to you when the war began?

00:01:18.562 --> 00:01:24.349
Hadassah Marcus: The war started by us in the first minute [at first] in the year 1939.

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:24.784
David Boder: Yes?

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:34.592
Hadassah Marcus: I was at that time with five small children and with my husband, and with a very large family. Our family consisted of over five hundred persons.

00:01:34.592 --> 00:01:35.641
David Boder: How is that?

00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:38.792
Hadassah Marcus: My children still had six grandfathers and six grandmothers.

00:01:38.792 --> 00:01:39.448
David Boder: Hm.

00:01:39.448 --> 00:01:40.671
Hadassah Marcus: All alive.

00:01:40.671 --> 00:01:41.075
David Boder: Yes.

00:01:41.075 --> 00:01:43.490
Hadassah Marcus: There was little mortality with us.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.469
David Boder: How can children have six grandfathers?

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.950
Hadassah Marcus: Four great grandmothers and four great grandfathers.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.077
David Boder: Oh, Nu?

00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:53.930
Hadassah Marcus: From both sides they were sll still alive.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.548
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:01:55.548 --> 00:02:02.351
Hadassah Marcus: [In] 1942 when the edict came out [the doom was proclaimed] on the 22nd [of] the seventh month.

00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:03.970
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.927
Hadassah Marcus: . . . a great panic gripped Warsaw.

00:02:06.927 --> 00:02:07.661
David Boder: Hm.

00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:13.629
Hadassah Marcus: And people began to look for places in industrial plants. By us they were called ‘shops’ [from the German Shuppen].

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.772
David Boder: In ’42? That late?

00:02:15.772 --> 00:02:16.336
Hadassah Marcus: Yes. Yes.

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:18.110
David Boder: Did you live in the Ghetto already before?

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.052
Hadassah Marcus: Before, in the Ghetto.

00:02:19.052 --> 00:02:23.233
David Boder: And so let us begin this way. What happened when the Germans entered Warsaw? What happened then?

00:02:23.233 --> 00:03:01.361
Hadassah Marcus: When the Germans entered there was a great panic. Right away we began to feel his strong hand. Right away he began strongly to exterminate us. And right away he began...at first with the great Jewith savants, and with our clergymen as well as with other men of learning. Right away he...all of our...the whole intelligentsia he took away from us. And later, when we had already lost the whole intelligentsia and all those who could show us a way [lead us], they started on us, the average people.

00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:02.386
David Boder: Hm.

00:03:02.386 --> 00:03:08.378
Hadassah Marcus: They began to take people into lagers. In the beginning we had words [regards] from the people.

00:03:08.378 --> 00:03:10.829
David Boder: And so when did they take you into the Ghetto?

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.689
Hadassah Marcus: Into the Ghetto they took us in the year 1941.

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:17.000
David Boder: Yes? And you went into the Ghetto with the others?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.668
Hadassah Marcus: Into the Ghetto with everything [everybody].

00:03:18.668 --> 00:03:19.215
David Boder: Hm.

00:03:19.215 --> 00:03:23.969
Hadassah Marcus: Because we were living in the region which was to become the Ghetto.

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:24.468
David Boder: Hm.

00:03:24.468 --> 00:03:32.173
Hadassah Marcus: So we just remained there. People who...if they were living outside the Ghetto were greatly broken up.

00:03:32.173 --> 00:03:32.437
David Boder: Hm.

00:03:32.437 --> 00:03:35.281
Hadassah Marcus: They weren’t able by any means to find living quarters.

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:35.630
David Boder: Hm.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.152
Hadassah Marcus: Because during all the time...during the entire war [the Jews of] the entire district of Poland...

00:03:40.152 --> 00:03:40.414
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:40.414 --> 00:03:42.059
Hadassah Marcus: . . . were pushed into Warsaw.

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.615
David Boder: Hm.

00:03:42.615 --> 00:03:44.229
Hadassah Marcus: So that it was very crowded...

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:45.408
David Boder: Christians as well, or just Jews?

00:03:45.408 --> 00:03:46.644
Hadassah Marcus: Only Jews.

00:03:46.644 --> 00:03:47.230
David Boder: Hm.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:04:00.344
Hadassah Marcus: Christians he left in peace entirely. He gave them all the rights that they demanded in order that the gentiles should be able to help, entirely in the open, with all the perpetrations that he wanted.

00:04:00.344 --> 00:04:01.100
David Boder: The German?

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.751
Hadassah Marcus: The German.

00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:05.142
David Boder: Nu? And so you were living in the Ghetto. On what street in Warsaw did you live?

00:04:05.142 --> 00:04:06.695
Hadassah Marcus: On Nowolipki 66.

00:04:06.695 --> 00:04:06.839
David Boder: Hm.

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:07.734
Hadassah Marcus: There I lived.

00:04:07.734 --> 00:04:08.579
David Boder: Hm.

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:44.565
Hadassah Marcus: Everyone of us took in many of his relatives. We shared with everything, with what we were able to. But in the year 1942 on the 22nd of the seventh month, when the edict came out that the Jews should be resetlled, we didn’t know what he wants [us] to do. He hung out placards that we are being sent to Lublin. And everyone of us can take along fifteen kilos. The finest people, the strongest, the...the entire youth took along baggage and went there, but alas, we had no more word from them.

00:04:44.565 --> 00:04:47.726
David Boder: Hm. That was still before the Ghetto was annihilated?

00:04:47.726 --> 00:04:48.283
Hadassah Marcus: Yes, that was all still before.

00:04:48.283 --> 00:04:50.271
David Boder: They hung placards that you should come to Lublin.

00:04:50.271 --> 00:04:51.384
Hadassah Marcus: Yes, yes.

00:04:51.384 --> 00:04:54.873
David Boder: Tell me, what was the occupation of your family in Warsaw?

00:04:54.873 --> 00:04:57.447
Hadassah Marcus: We were diamond dealers.

00:04:57.447 --> 00:05:01.074
David Boder: Oh. Where did you buy the diamonds? Where did you sell them?

00:05:01.074 --> 00:05:02.476
Hadassah Marcus: One from another.

00:05:02.476 --> 00:05:04.580
David Boder: Hm. In...in peace time you...

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.608
Hadassah Marcus: In peace time and during the war.

00:05:06.608 --> 00:05:06.817
David Boder: Hm.

00:05:06.817 --> 00:05:09.980
Hadassah Marcus: Because this had been for generations...dealers in silver and gold [and] diamonds.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.938
David Boder: Do you understand diamonds?

00:05:11.938 --> 00:05:13.748
Hadassah Marcus: I? No. I, myself, no.

00:05:13.748 --> 00:05:19.036
David Boder: Nu. And so? What did you do with the merchandise that you had?

00:05:19.036 --> 00:05:26.038
Hadassah Marcus: Nu, that...when the war started I had four factories of my own, and when the Germans entered.

00:05:26.038 --> 00:05:26.674
David Boder: Factories?

00:05:26.674 --> 00:05:26.704
Hadassah Marcus: Yes.

00:05:26.704 --> 00:05:27.549
David Boder: What sort of factories did you have?

00:05:27.549 --> 00:05:31.472
Hadassah Marcus: Chemical. We manufactured argentum nitricum [silver nitrate].

00:05:31.472 --> 00:05:31.641
David Boder: Yes?

00:05:31.641 --> 00:05:34.785
Hadassah Marcus: That is needed for photographic [work], for lithography [words not clear].

00:05:34.785 --> 00:05:36.575
David Boder: So you had another occupation besides diamonds.

00:05:36.575 --> 00:05:37.290
Hadassah Marcus: Everything.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.767
David Boder: Yes?

00:05:37.767 --> 00:05:41.929
Hadassah Marcus: There was everything. I was a great enterprising power.

00:05:41.929 --> 00:05:42.118
David Boder: Yes?

00:05:42.118 --> 00:05:47.800
Hadassah Marcus: My husband was a...a...a...he had everything under his hand.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.064
David Boder: Hm.

00:05:48.064 --> 00:05:54.058
Hadassah Marcus: And the basic thing...our occupation was gold, silver, and diamonds. This was so from generation to generation.

00:05:54.058 --> 00:06:01.931
David Boder: Hm. Yes? So what do you say was done, you did with your merchandise, with all that you had?

00:06:01.931 --> 00:06:08.405
Hadassah Marcus: My merchandise...when there had come out the edicts that we should be resettled...

00:06:08.405 --> 00:06:08.994
David Boder: Yes?

00:06:08.994 --> 00:06:10.752
Hadassah Marcus: . . . we hid it.

00:06:10.752 --> 00:06:11.433
David Boder: Hm.

00:06:11.433 --> 00:06:14.684
Hadassah Marcus: But after a few months...someone had informed on us.

00:06:14.684 --> 00:06:15.150
David Boder: Hm.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.500
Hadassah Marcus: Because even then we were doing business. And they took my husband away. He sat [was imprisoned] for three months.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.518
David Boder: Hm.

00:06:20.518 --> 00:06:23.616
Hadassah Marcus: I was left alone then with the five children.

00:06:23.616 --> 00:06:24.121
David Boder: Yes?

00:06:24.121 --> 00:06:28.362
Hadassah Marcus: He was murderously beaten. One day he received seventy five strokes.

00:06:28.362 --> 00:06:29.625
David Boder: Who?

00:06:29.625 --> 00:06:30.298
Hadassah Marcus: The husband.

00:06:30.298 --> 00:06:30.914
David Boder: Yes?

00:06:30.914 --> 00:06:36.609
Hadassah Marcus: Only because they knew that he can hold out and that he has money.

00:06:36.609 --> 00:06:36.778
David Boder: Hm.

00:06:36.778 --> 00:06:39.983
Hadassah Marcus: He was merderously tortured, but [words not clear]...

00:06:39.983 --> 00:06:40.033
David Boder: What did they want?

00:06:40.033 --> 00:06:42.766
Hadassah Marcus: They didn’t want anything. They just tortured him.

00:06:42.766 --> 00:06:44.744
David Boder: Yes, did they ask anything?

00:06:44.744 --> 00:06:44.744
Hadassah Marcus: Yes.

00:06:44.744 --> 00:06:48.899
David Boder: Did they demand anything?

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:54.457
Hadassah Marcus: They demanded that we should give out to them the wealthy Jew [Jewish N’giddim] who were still around.

00:06:54.457 --> 00:06:55.756
David Boder: What does N’giddim mean?

00:06:55.756 --> 00:06:57.577
Hadassah Marcus: Where there are still the very wealthy...

00:06:57.577 --> 00:06:58.605
David Boder: Hm.

00:06:58.605 --> 00:06:58.726
Hadassah Marcus: . . . those who have money.

00:06:58.726 --> 00:06:58.756
David Boder: Hm.

00:06:58.756 --> 00:07:00.939
Hadassah Marcus: When he will betray them, then they will set him free.

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:02.240
David Boder: Nu?

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:08.404
Hadassah Marcus: But one was acting like one ought to act. And we succeeded in getting him out after three months of imprisonment.

00:07:08.404 --> 00:07:09.038
David Boder: Hm.

00:07:09.038 --> 00:07:21.152
Hadassah Marcus: We thought then that it was a piece of luck. But a few months later there began to erupt in the Ghetto strong blockades, as we called them.

00:07:21.152 --> 00:07:21.490
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:27.526
Hadassah Marcus: Every day they took away ten...over ten thousand persons from Warsaw. They were sent away.

00:07:27.526 --> 00:07:29.101
David Boder: Hm.

00:07:29.101 --> 00:07:44.439
Hadassah Marcus: Where were they sent? That varied. From no one did we receive word any more. I lost my husband [in] the year [one] thousand nine hundred [forty] three...in the year ’42 in the eight month.

00:07:44.439 --> 00:07:45.706
David Boder: Hm. In August.

00:07:45.706 --> 00:07:46.099
Hadassah Marcus: Yes.

00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:46.582
David Boder: What does it mean?

00:07:46.582 --> 00:07:49.509
Hadassah Marcus: Then I remained alone with all the children.

00:07:49.509 --> 00:07:51.109
David Boder: What does it mean? Was he arrested, or was he...

00:07:51.109 --> 00:07:53.916
Hadassah Marcus: He went out accidentally.

00:07:53.916 --> 00:07:55.012
David Boder: Yes?

00:07:55.012 --> 00:07:57.245
Hadassah Marcus: And there was going on a very strong blockade [raid].

00:07:57.245 --> 00:07:57.698
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:57.698 --> 00:07:59.418
Hadassah Marcus: All people were taken away.

00:07:59.418 --> 00:08:00.264
David Boder: Hm.

00:08:00.264 --> 00:08:03.282
Hadassah Marcus: At that time they took away the entire ‘shop’. At that time he was going to a ‘shop’.

00:08:03.282 --> 00:08:04.911
David Boder: What? Oh. A german ‘shop’?

00:08:04.911 --> 00:08:05.475
Hadassah Marcus: Yes.

00:08:05.475 --> 00:08:06.863
David Boder: He was working there?

00:08:06.863 --> 00:08:07.197
Hadassah Marcus: Yes.

00:08:07.197 --> 00:08:11.181
Hadassah Marcus: And he was taken away, the entire ‘shop’, everybody. The entire ‘shop’ was liquidated at that time.

00:08:11.181 --> 00:08:13.065
David Boder: Yes.

00:08:13.065 --> 00:08:18.816
Hadassah Marcus: And I did not have any more...I was left with all the children alone...

00:08:18.816 --> 00:08:19.092
David Boder: Hm.

00:08:19.092 --> 00:08:28.198
Hadassah Marcus: . . . in very hard circumstances, because ten times a day such blockades were going on.

00:08:28.198 --> 00:08:30.929
David Boder: Hm. During the blockades they did what?

00:08:30.929 --> 00:08:38.146
Hadassah Marcus: During the blockades they shot, searched, and exterminated, in all the cellars, in all the offices.

00:08:38.146 --> 00:08:38.448
David Boder: Hm.

00:08:38.448 --> 00:08:45.179
Hadassah Marcus: . . . in all the places where one might be able...where it just looked that one might be hidden.

00:08:45.179 --> 00:08:45.572
David Boder: Hm.

00:08:45.572 --> 00:08:58.985
Hadassah Marcus: And he who was found was either shot on the spot, because he had hidden himself, or he was taken to the distribution depot and [from] there sent away to Treblinka. At that time Warsaw was going mostly to Treblinka.

00:08:58.985 --> 00:09:02.305
David Boder: Treblinka is what, where? Near Katowice? Near Sosnowice?

00:09:02.305 --> 00:09:03.081
Hadassah Marcus: No.

00:09:03.081 --> 00:09:04.117
David Boder: Where is Treblinka?

00:09:04.117 --> 00:09:06.630
Hadassah Marcus: Treblinka is not far from Warsaw. I don’t...

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.650
David Boder: Hm.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:07.133
Hadassah Marcus: . . . know exactly.

00:09:07.133 --> 00:09:08.500
David Boder: Yes, yes.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:08.953
Hadassah Marcus: . . . where.

00:09:08.953 --> 00:09:10.547
David Boder: Hm. Nu, go on.

00:09:10.547 --> 00:09:14.484
Hadassah Marcus: During all that time all the transports went to Treblinka.

00:09:14.484 --> 00:09:15.007
David Boder: Hm.

00:09:15.007 --> 00:09:19.565
Hadassah Marcus: In the year 1943, the 18th, the first [month]...

00:09:19.565 --> 00:09:20.018
David Boder: Yes?

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:25.873
Hadassah Marcus: . . . there was a great holocaust. They took all the shops away. Everything [was] liquidated.

00:09:25.873 --> 00:09:27.382
David Boder: What does it mean, a holocaust?

00:09:27.382 --> 00:09:30.158
Hadassah Marcus: That there was...nobody could save himself...

00:09:30.158 --> 00:09:31.365
David Boder: Hm.

00:09:31.365 --> 00:09:36.335
Hadassah Marcus: . . . but one shop. It was then on the Nowolipie Street. Shultz’s

00:09:36.335 --> 00:09:37.136
David Boder: Hm.

00:09:37.136 --> 00:09:48.635
Hadassah Marcus: That shop was left unharmed at that time. And the entire Ghetto was emptied out. And at that time, in my absence, on the 18th, first [month], they took all my children away.

00:09:48.635 --> 00:09:49.662
David Boder: Just took them away?

00:09:49.662 --> 00:09:50.278
Hadassah Marcus: Yes.

00:09:50.278 --> 00:09:50.950
David Boder: [Words not clear.]

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:51.800
Hadassah Marcus: In my absence.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.065
David Boder: [Words not clear.]

00:09:52.065 --> 00:09:54.110
Hadassah Marcus: I was not at home...home then [words not clear]...

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:55.276
David Boder: In your absence...

00:09:55.276 --> 00:09:56.315
Hadassah Marcus: Yes.

00:09:56.315 --> 00:09:57.492
David Boder: . . . your children were taken away? How old were they?

00:09:57.492 --> 00:10:00.249
Hadassah Marcus: The oldest child was ten and a half years old.

00:10:00.249 --> 00:10:00.515
David Boder: Hm

00:10:00.515 --> 00:10:03.533
Hadassah Marcus: The next one [was] seven years, and twins of four years.

00:10:03.533 --> 00:10:04.945
David Boder: Hm.

00:10:04.945 --> 00:10:06.716
Hadassah Marcus: One had died...

00:10:06.716 --> 00:10:06.927
David Boder: Hm.

00:10:06.927 --> 00:10:09.613
Hadassah Marcus: . . . a short time before, a handicapped[?].

00:10:09.613 --> 00:10:11.561
David Boder: And there they permitted...

00:10:11.561 --> 00:10:18.285
Hadassah Marcus: There...Yes. There people worked at furriery, at furs, at shoemaking, at various trades.

00:10:18.285 --> 00:10:20.108
David Boder: Oh, it was a large shop.

00:10:20.108 --> 00:10:22.163
Hadassah Marcus: [With emphasis] A large shop. One of the largest shops.

00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:25.995
David Boder: And did people live there like in lagers or in...or people lived at home?

00:10:25.995 --> 00:10:27.427
Hadassah Marcus: Variously. In homes.

00:10:27.427 --> 00:10:28.639
David Boder: And where did you live?

00:10:28.639 --> 00:10:32.361
Hadassah Marcus: I was also living...at that time I still had an uncle...

00:10:32.361 --> 00:10:32.658
David Boder: Hm.

00:10:32.658 --> 00:10:34.548
Hadassah Marcus: . . . a brother, and a sister.

00:10:34.548 --> 00:10:34.768
David Boder: Hm.

00:10:34.768 --> 00:10:36.292
Hadassah Marcus: So we were [living] together.

00:10:36.292 --> 00:10:38.237
David Boder: Hm. Nu?

00:10:38.237 --> 00:10:43.232
Hadassah Marcus: In 1943 after the Ghetto purge...

00:10:43.232 --> 00:10:44.149
David Boder: Yes?

00:10:44.149 --> 00:10:49.619
Hadassah Marcus: . . . we perceived that the time was coming for Shultz’s terrain [factory] as well.

00:10:49.619 --> 00:10:50.048
David Boder: Hm.

00:10:50.048 --> 00:10:53.090
Hadassah Marcus: During the second Seder night [the second night of Passover] we went down into the bunker.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:54.080
David Boder: During the second Seder?

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:54.631
Hadassah Marcus: Yes.

00:10:54.631 --> 00:10:56.470
David Boder: And where did you have a bunker?

00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:00.287
Hadassah Marcus: The bunker was entirely under the ground, very deep underground.

00:11:00.287 --> 00:11:00.563
David Boder: Hm.

00:11:00.563 --> 00:11:03.653
Hadassah Marcus: Without windows, without air, and without anything.

00:11:03.653 --> 00:11:05.321
David Boder: And who had made the bunker?

00:11:05.321 --> 00:11:07.856
Hadassah Marcus: It was made by a few people...

00:11:07.856 --> 00:11:08.364
David Boder: Hm.

00:11:08.364 --> 00:11:22.758
Hadassah Marcus: Thirty-odd people were living in that bunker. [Words not clear. A few words might be missing due to a break in the wire. She apparently tells about camouflaging doors]...which were leading from the house. And they [pieces of furniture] were put back in the same place where they were before so that nobody in no way could find a trace, that something is to be found there.

00:11:22.758 --> 00:11:26.124
David Boder: And so wait...wait a moment. The bunker was in a cellar or in a...

00:11:26.124 --> 00:11:27.179
Hadassah Marcus: Underground.

00:11:27.179 --> 00:11:27.860
David Boder: Underground.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:28.231
Hadassah Marcus: Yes.

00:11:28.231 --> 00:11:29.672
David Boder: And how did one enter there? Through...

00:11:29.672 --> 00:11:31.706
Hadassah Marcus: Through the...through rooms of the house.

00:11:31.706 --> 00:11:31.746
David Boder: Hm.

00:11:31.746 --> 00:11:33.489
Hadassah Marcus: And through there corridors were made.

00:11:33.489 --> 00:11:33.970
David Boder: Yes?

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:35.303
Hadassah Marcus: Everything [was] underground.

00:11:35.303 --> 00:11:36.261
David Boder: Yes?

00:11:36.261 --> 00:11:38.726
Hadassah Marcus: And that is how we entered that cellar.

00:11:38.726 --> 00:11:42.223
David Boder: Yes. Nu? Who was it that had built...built such things?

00:11:42.223 --> 00:11:44.758
Hadassah Marcus: One’s own people, alone with our [own] hands.

00:11:44.758 --> 00:11:48.760
David Boder: Nu? And where did one discard the earth, everything?

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:58.373
Hadassah Marcus: The earth was thrown out, because we had been preparing already [for] months in advance. We knew that a moment will arrive when they will make Warsaw completely Jew-clean [Juden-rein].

00:11:58.373 --> 00:11:59.085
David Boder: Hm.

00:11:59.085 --> 00:12:02.872
Hadassah Marcus: That which one could never imagine before, that such a thing could happen.

00:12:02.872 --> 00:12:04.480
David Boder: Nu? And then?

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:10.770
Hadassah Marcus: On the 13th of April, on the 13th of the fourth [month]—this was after having been in a bunker a few weeks...

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:11.273
David Boder: Yes?

00:12:11.273 --> 00:12:13.469
Hadassah Marcus: . . . we were discovered.

00:12:13.469 --> 00:12:14.191
David Boder: How?

00:12:14.191 --> 00:12:24.160
Hadassah Marcus: They let in to us...another bunker had been discovered and there was found someone who reported us [?]. He had no way out any more, and we had to start going out.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.445
David Boder: How many people were you in the bunker?

00:12:25.445 --> 00:12:27.970
Hadassah Marcus: Thirty-odd people we were then, one’s own [people].

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:30.353
David Boder: How did people sleep there? Eat?

00:12:30.353 --> 00:12:34.341
Hadassah Marcus: Everything below..We had made makeshift beds.

00:12:34.341 --> 00:12:34.602
David Boder: Hm.

00:12:34.602 --> 00:12:37.516
Hadassah Marcus: As far as eating, we lived on whatever we could.

00:12:37.516 --> 00:12:38.831
David Boder: Yes?

00:12:38.831 --> 00:12:41.859
Hadassah Marcus: Because food did not have any place with us [did not enter one’s mind].

00:12:41.859 --> 00:12:44.444
David Boder: And when one had to go? How did one...

00:12:44.444 --> 00:12:51.275
Hadassah Marcus: Oh, everything [everybody] together, because we had no other possibilities. We couldn’t get to the surface.

00:12:51.275 --> 00:12:53.709
David Boder: Hm. Nu

00:12:53.709 --> 00:12:57.659
Hadassah Marcus: They took us out on a Friday at one o’clock.

00:12:57.659 --> 00:12:58.182
David Boder: Yes?

00:12:58.182 --> 00:13:09.575
Hadassah Marcus: Up to twelve o’clock of the same day the people who were discovered in bunkers were taken into the Ghetto—there were no more people there [ or: they did not appear human any more]—into the [house of the] Jewish Community Council.

00:13:09.575 --> 00:13:09.958
David Boder: Yes?

00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:19.371
Hadassah Marcus: And they gave everyone one shot, no more. That shot, wherever it hit...so that people were...from one shot can still live ‘quite well.’

00:13:19.371 --> 00:13:20.585
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:20.585 --> 00:13:24.906
Hadassah Marcus: One of those caught had to take all those people...

00:13:24.906 --> 00:13:25.229
David Boder: Hm.

00:13:25.229 --> 00:13:36.197
Hadassah Marcus: . . . who had received the shot [ not clear, possible a break in the wire]. And he who did that had to lie down last on top.

00:13:36.197 --> 00:13:36.758
David Boder: Hm.

00:13:36.758 --> 00:13:39.914
Hadassah Marcus: This was until twelve o’clock of the same Friday.

00:13:39.914 --> 00:13:41.579
David Boder: Who told you that?

00:13:41.579 --> 00:13:46.160
Hadassah Marcus: That was told to me by people who had...had been present.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:46.661
David Boder: Did [words not clear]?

00:13:46.661 --> 00:13:57.598
Hadassah Marcus: Such...Yes. Who had...There were people who had masqueraded as Germans. There was an apparatus [organization] for...people knew everything. All that was reported.

00:13:57.598 --> 00:14:00.155
David Boder: Hm.

00:14:00.155 --> 00:14:09.093
Hadassah Marcus: Fate wanted it that we should remain alive, and we were taken out an hour later. Because this edict [doom] lasted until twelve on the same day.

00:14:09.093 --> 00:14:11.069
David Boder: Hm.

00:14:11.069 --> 00:14:25.474
Hadassah Marcus: At one o’clock we were taken out and searched as big as we were. We couldn’t take anything along with us, and besides that, we didn’t want to, because we knew where we were going, that we were going to Treblinka.

00:14:25.474 --> 00:14:28.236
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:28.236 --> 00:14:53.579
Hadassah Marcus: Or else we thought that we were going to be burned by them like our previous people, But they led us to the distribution depot. There was the assembly place for all the people whom they had gathered together, and we were, on the same day, Friday afternoon, put into the RR-cars. In the wagon in which I was, were over a hundred people. The RR-car couldn’t take in any more than fifty-odd [persons].

00:14:53.579 --> 00:14:54.553
David Boder: Men and women?

00:14:54.553 --> 00:15:00.952
Hadassah Marcus: Men, women, and children. It is [was] without exception. Thirty-nine people were suffocated.

00:15:00.952 --> 00:15:01.215
David Boder: Hm.

00:15:01.215 --> 00:15:01.969
Hadassah Marcus: From the heat.

00:15:01.969 --> 00:15:03.384
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:03.384 --> 00:15:18.130
Hadassah Marcus: Because there were no windows. A very small window far up. Many people jumped out, not because they wanted to save themselves. They wanted to perish in the [open] air.

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:19.960
David Boder: One moment, please.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:16:03.570
David Boder: [In English] This concludes Spool number 128, a report by Mrs. Hadassah Marcus. She is in a...and we continue on spool number 129. Henonville, fifty kilometers from Paris, in an Agudah Israel home, supported by the Agudah, and the educational part maintained by the ORT organization. We go over to Spool 129. Illinois Institute of Technology Wire Recording.

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:32.217
David Boder: [In English] France. September 13th, 1946. Henonville near Paris. A home for displaced Jews mainly maintained by...by a Kibbutz and supported by the Agudah Israel, and also having another organization, a Yeshiva from Lithuania. Mrs. Hadassah Marcus is continuing her report which had started on [Spool] 128.

00:16:32.217 --> 00:16:35.925
David Boder: [In Yiddish] And so, Mrs. Marcus, they took you there to the distribution depot.

00:16:35.925 --> 00:16:58.902
Hadassah Marcus: Yes. On the same day, Friday, in the evening I was taken to the RR-cars. We were in the RR-cars over a hundred people where there could be only about fifty. Thirty-nine persons had suffocated, because we were completely without air. There was a small window. People were fighting to get out, to get out not for the sake of living, but at least to perish in the air.

00:16:58.902 --> 00:17:00.407
David Boder: You mean to jump out?

00:17:00.407 --> 00:17:00.938
Hadassah Marcus: Yes.

00:17:00.938 --> 00:17:01.790
David Boder: Nu, go on.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:34.962
Hadassah Marcus: And in the...When dawn came we saw that we were being led not to Treblinka, but we were being led in the direction of Lublin, that means to Majdanek. We arrived in Lublin, and from there, guarded each fifth row by two soldiers with large dogs, with rifles ready, we were led to Majdanek, which is a few kilometers from Lublin. When we arrived in Majdanek we were the first transport of Jews, of Jewish women. Men were already there, Slovakian Jews.

00:17:34.962 --> 00:17:37.487
David Boder: Who was there before?

00:17:37.487 --> 00:17:40.665
Hadassah Marcus: The Germans. At that time this was a completely new lager.

00:17:40.665 --> 00:17:42.059
David Boder: Oh, it was a new lager.

00:17:42.059 --> 00:17:45.398
Hadassah Marcus: Yes. We were among the first Jews in Majdanek.

00:17:45.398 --> 00:17:46.332
David Boder: In ’43 it was?

00:17:46.332 --> 00:17:49.781
Hadassah Marcus: In the year ’43 on the first of May we arrived in Majdanek.

00:17:49.781 --> 00:17:50.965
David Boder: Hm.

00:17:50.965 --> 00:18:25.220
Hadassah Marcus: We lived under very hazardous conditions. As Jews...They took away our shoes, and we had to stand all night on a field barefoot. Majdanek has a climate which has strong winds, unheard of, or great heats. Throughout the night a frost [snow?] of ten centimeters [ thick ] lay on the ground. They examined our feet, if we didn’t put a piece of paper underneath. Afterwards, in the morning, we had to run, not walk, to work, chased after by a young female SS man with a giant dog. Her name was Brigida.

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:26.012
David Boder: Brigida?

00:18:26.012 --> 00:18:26.515
Hadassah Marcus: Birgida.

00:18:26.515 --> 00:18:28.030
David Boder: She was an SS woman.

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:29.052
Hadassah Marcus: An SS woman.

00:18:29.052 --> 00:18:30.745
David Boder: But you had said a female SS man [SS-manke].

00:18:30.745 --> 00:18:32.040
Hadassah Marcus: A female SS.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:32.523
David Boder: Yes.

00:18:32.523 --> 00:18:52.938
Hadassah Marcus: She was...it is possible that we didn’t find in all that time another such woman as she was. Her badness exceeded all human understanding. Running barefoot...The Kommando [contingent of prisoners] numbered around fifteen hundred people.

00:18:52.938 --> 00:18:53.996
David Boder: Hm.

00:18:53.996 --> 00:19:23.388
Hadassah Marcus: Whether in rain or in snow at that time, we had to stand and work. She carried on a lot. When she noticed anything, she released a dog. We were bitten, our clothes torn off. And when one returned to the lager bitten, the next day he was taken to the crematory, because people who weren’t completely well, or if one had the smallest rash on himself, one didn’t have the right to live.

00:19:23.388 --> 00:19:25.103
David Boder: Scabs—what they call it..

00:19:25.103 --> 00:19:29.728
Hadassah Marcus: An itch, or a wind burn, or a blister from rubbing.

00:19:29.728 --> 00:19:30.381
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:30.381 --> 00:19:45.714
Hadassah Marcus: Immediately she had no right to live, and she was immediately taken to the crematory. We were given absolutely no medical help. Whoever gave us the least bit of help was punished.

00:19:45.714 --> 00:19:47.449
David Boder: And what did you work at?

00:19:47.449 --> 00:19:49.373
Hadassah Marcus: We worked then in the field.

00:19:49.373 --> 00:19:49.946
David Boder: Hm

00:19:49.946 --> 00:20:04.235
Hadassah Marcus: Later on we worked by bricks. We were helping, alas, to build a new crematory on that field which was in Auschwitz near the bath. At that time people were...they were burning, gassing the people in the bath where we bathed.

00:20:04.235 --> 00:20:04.548
David Boder: Hm.

00:20:04.548 --> 00:20:08.328
Hadassah Marcus: In another part. And they were burned in a pit.

00:20:08.328 --> 00:20:09.603
David Boder: What do you mean, in a pit? In an open ditch?

00:20:09.603 --> 00:20:10.918
Hadassah Marcus: In an open ditch.

00:20:10.918 --> 00:20:11.351
David Boder: Yes?

00:20:11.351 --> 00:20:27.378
Hadassah Marcus: We ourselves were present when we took out still unburned pieces, parts of people, and took them on the trucks and threw them in the water. The ashes [were] either thrown in the water or they were strewn in the gardens.

00:20:27.378 --> 00:20:28.681
David Boder: Nu?

00:20:28.681 --> 00:20:43.633
Hadassah Marcus: And so this crematory [the ditch?] was not enough for them, and we ourselves had to help carry bricks at night to build the crematory. Three months I was in Majdanek, After three months I was sent to Auschwitz.

00:20:43.633 --> 00:20:44.637
David Boder: Why? What...

00:20:44.637 --> 00:20:53.031
Hadassah Marcus: There were transports from Majdanek. We were told that we were being sent to factories to work.

00:20:53.031 --> 00:20:54.766
David Boder: Where were you tattooed?

00:20:54.766 --> 00:20:56.670
Hadassah Marcus: We were tattooed in Auschwitz.

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:58.143
David Boder: Hm. Nu, and so?

00:20:58.143 --> 00:21:01.742
Hadassah Marcus: Only Auschwitz gave tattooes, no other lager.[??].

00:21:01.742 --> 00:21:03.686
David Boder: Hm. Bergen-Belsen neither?

00:21:03.686 --> 00:21:04.109
Hadassah Marcus: No.

00:21:04.109 --> 00:21:05.935
David Boder: No. And so.

00:21:05.935 --> 00:21:08.089
Hadassah Marcus: In Auschwitz I arrived...

00:21:08.089 --> 00:21:10.113
David Boder: How many people were traveling with you to Auschwitz?

00:21:10.113 --> 00:21:12.598
Hadassah Marcus: To Auschwitz we traveled in parties.

00:21:12.598 --> 00:21:13.137
David Boder: Hm.

00:21:13.137 --> 00:21:16.203
Hadassah Marcus: With my transport traveled over a thousand people.

00:21:16.203 --> 00:21:17.316
David Boder: Only women, or men also?

00:21:17.316 --> 00:21:18.220
Hadassah Marcus: Women and men.

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:19.214
David Boder: Hm.

00:21:19.214 --> 00:21:22.513
Hadassah Marcus: The...A night before, before we went to Auschwitz...

00:21:22.513 --> 00:21:23.347
David Boder: Hm.

00:21:23.347 --> 00:21:28.640
Hadassah Marcus: . . . we had already been selected. We were at twelve at night...This was still in Majdanek.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.233
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:29.233 --> 00:21:33.331
Hadassah Marcus: We were already asleep. So they ordered [us] to dress quickly.

00:21:33.331 --> 00:21:34.333
David Boder: Hm.

00:21:34.333 --> 00:21:57.200
Hadassah Marcus: We didn’t know where we were being taken. The men of...of that field knew that now we were being led into the crematory. There was a case that one man had a wife among us, who still remained in Majdanek. He was a doctor, and he knew exactly where we were being led. So he poisoned himself.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.102
David Boder: The doctor?

00:21:58.102 --> 00:21:58.545
Hadassah Marcus: Yes.

00:21:58.545 --> 00:21:59.128
David Boder: A Jew?

00:21:59.128 --> 00:22:12.940
Hadassah Marcus: A Jew. But the same night, as we were being led on the road to the crematory, there arrived someone riding a white horse, and...and he...and he gave some kind of an order, and we were led back again [Note on p. 48-(2743)].

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.706
David Boder: Where to? To...to where were you led back?

00:22:15.706 --> 00:22:17.101
Hadassah Marcus: To...into the field.

00:22:17.101 --> 00:22:17.834
David Boder: Into the field?

00:22:17.834 --> 00:22:19.658
Hadassah Marcus: Yes. While on the road.

00:22:19.658 --> 00:22:20.782
David Boder: From Auschwitz?

00:22:20.782 --> 00:22:21.504
Hadassah Marcus: In Majdanek.

00:22:21.504 --> 00:22:22.719
David Boder: In Majdanek.

00:22:22.719 --> 00:22:27.368
Hadassah Marcus: Because it had been the road to the crematory, but the one on the white horse had arrived...

00:22:27.368 --> 00:22:27.853
David Boder: Who was he?

00:22:27.853 --> 00:22:40.138
Hadassah Marcus: . . . in the midst of the road. An SS man, and with an order that we should be led back. When we returned we didn’t find that doctor any more, because he know that the wife had been led to the crematory. And he was found poisoned.

00:22:40.138 --> 00:22:42.855
David Boder: So you were...you were then taken back to Majdanek.

00:22:42.855 --> 00:22:43.487
Hadassah Marcus: Yes.

00:22:43.487 --> 00:22:44.090
David Boder: Nu? What did you...

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:46.786
Hadassah Marcus: But the next morning they led us to Auschwitz.

00:22:46.786 --> 00:22:47.630
David Boder: Again you were led to Auschwitz?

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:55.144
Hadassah Marcus: Yes. When we arrived in Auschwitz we were assured that we had arrived in a lucky moment, that there are no more crematories.

00:22:55.144 --> 00:22:55.739
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:55.739 --> 00:22:57.975
Hadassah Marcus: That means there are, but Jews are not being burned any more.

00:22:57.975 --> 00:22:58.359
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:58.359 --> 00:23:15.198
Hadassah Marcus: We calmed down a little, but immediately on arrival they made a selection. At that time I was still with a sister, with a very young sister. She we fifteen years old. I was put to the side, to go to the crematory. And...

00:23:15.198 --> 00:23:17.062
David Boder: You had been told that they were not burning any more.

00:23:17.062 --> 00:23:20.769
Hadassah Marcus: But so was the case. When we arrived it was so.

00:23:20.769 --> 00:23:21.175
David Boder: Hm.

00:23:21.175 --> 00:23:25.516
Hadassah Marcus: We were comforted with that, that they are not burning any more, but I myself was put to the side.

00:23:25.516 --> 00:23:26.815
David Boder: Hm.

00:23:26.815 --> 00:23:38.326
Hadassah Marcus: We sat a few hours and waited till we should be taken away, but an order came again that we should be taken into the lager together with the rest of the transport.

00:23:38.326 --> 00:23:39.406
David Boder: Hm.

00:23:39.406 --> 00:23:43.959
Hadassah Marcus: After that I worked for three months in Auschwitz, in water.

00:23:43.959 --> 00:23:45.370
David Boder: When were you tattooed?

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:46.630
Hadassah Marcus: Immediately on arrival.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:47.890
David Boder: Nu?

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:48.395
Hadassah Marcus: And so.

00:23:48.395 --> 00:23:49.836
David Boder: Was your hair cut off?

00:23:49.836 --> 00:23:53.483
Hadassah Marcus: I [?]...entirely cut off the hair. In Majdanek we had our hair.

00:23:53.483 --> 00:23:53.927
David Boder: Hm.

00:23:53.927 --> 00:23:57.151
Hadassah Marcus: In Auschwitz wherever a hair was found it was...

00:23:57.151 --> 00:23:58.532
David Boder: Who did the cutting?

00:23:58.532 --> 00:23:59.287
Hadassah Marcus: Women.

00:23:59.287 --> 00:24:00.033
David Boder: Women.

00:24:00.033 --> 00:24:00.637
Hadassah Marcus: Yes.

00:24:00.637 --> 00:24:04.505
David Boder: Were there any cases that men did it?

00:24:04.505 --> 00:24:09.179
Hadassah Marcus: In my time there were no [such] cases, but in any case men were standing by.

00:24:09.179 --> 00:24:10.348
David Boder: Men were standing by?

00:24:10.348 --> 00:24:10.922
Hadassah Marcus: Yes.

00:24:10.922 --> 00:24:12.312
David Boder: They watched it?

00:24:12.312 --> 00:24:13.270
Hadassah Marcus: Yes.

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:14.923
David Boder: Who were the men?

00:24:14.923 --> 00:24:15.881
Hadassah Marcus: Various ones.

00:24:15.881 --> 00:24:16.265
David Boder: [Word not clear.]

00:24:16.265 --> 00:24:24.517
Hadassah Marcus: There were SS men...SS men. There were capos, and there were people who were working there in the bath.

00:24:24.517 --> 00:24:25.596
David Boder: Hm.

00:24:25.596 --> 00:24:27.037
Hadassah Marcus: Because in the bath men were working, men, too.

00:24:27.037 --> 00:24:28.064
David Boder: Men [worked] in the bath.

00:24:28.064 --> 00:24:29.273
Hadassah Marcus: Men and women.

00:24:29.273 --> 00:24:30.775
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:24:30.775 --> 00:24:37.805
Hadassah Marcus: After three months of work in the water—that means that in the morning we went in the water and stood up to the neck...

00:24:37.805 --> 00:24:40.373
David Boder: What was the work in the water?

00:24:40.373 --> 00:24:41.340
Hadassah Marcus: Gathered the leaves.

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:41.845
David Boder: Yes.

00:24:41.845 --> 00:24:44.072
Hadassah Marcus: And gathered the...such long...

00:24:44.072 --> 00:24:44.758
David Boder: The grass?

00:24:44.758 --> 00:24:47.649
Hadassah Marcus: Yes. It was taken out on the field.

00:24:47.649 --> 00:24:48.012
David Boder: Hm.

00:24:48.012 --> 00:24:48.849
Hadassah Marcus: It was dried.

00:24:48.849 --> 00:24:49.263
David Boder: Hm.

00:24:49.263 --> 00:24:53.786
Hadassah Marcus: Afterwards it was gathered and...I don’t know what they used it for. [They were possible cutting peat or processing flax.]

00:24:53.786 --> 00:24:56.889
David Boder: But they wanted to use it for something?

00:24:56.889 --> 00:24:58.542
Hadassah Marcus: Possibly. This I don’t know.

00:24:58.542 --> 00:25:01.766
David Boder: How many people were working in the water?

00:25:01.766 --> 00:25:12.473
Hadassah Marcus: In my time, when I was working at this work, this Kommando numbered two hundred fifty people. Two hundred people were in the water at a time, and fifty people were working outside.

00:25:12.473 --> 00:25:12.987
David Boder: Hm.

00:25:12.987 --> 00:25:25.395
Hadassah Marcus: When there was no [work in the] water, we were carrying barrows, but barrows heaped up to capacity, that from seven till twelve we weren’t permitted to rest or to put down the barrow to load in the sand for us.

00:25:25.395 --> 00:25:25.748
David Boder: Hm.

00:25:25.748 --> 00:25:38.669
Hadassah Marcus: We had to carry it in the hand and go around, and ten Christians stood with shovels, and everyone threw in a shovel, so that, God forbid, we shouldn’t be able to rest, not at the loading and not at the unloading.

00:25:38.669 --> 00:25:42.950
David Boder: Tell me about the water. How did one work in there? People went in with the clothes?

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:46.264
Hadassah Marcus: With the clothes we went in the water. Only the shoes were taken off.

00:25:46.264 --> 00:25:46.566
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:46.566 --> 00:25:57.714
Hadassah Marcus: If it happened that someone said that he isn’t feeling well, he cannot go into the water, [then] he couldn’t even take off the shoes. He was thrown in, the way he was standing and walking [just as he was], into the water.

00:25:57.714 --> 00:26:03.989
David Boder: He was thrown into the water. Nu, what did one work? When one took out the grass...the grass, did one have to dive, or what?

00:26:03.989 --> 00:26:06.850
Hadassah Marcus: We went...the water reached up to our neck.

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:07.515
David Boder: Nu?

00:26:07.515 --> 00:26:11.548
Hadassah Marcus: And thus with the hands we gathered it and carried it to the shore.

00:26:11.548 --> 00:26:12.114
David Boder: Hm.

00:26:12.114 --> 00:26:16.788
Hadassah Marcus: . . . and went again, constantly farther...in summer...whatever could be found.

00:26:16.788 --> 00:26:18.894
David Boder: All that happened already in Auschwitz.

00:26:18.894 --> 00:26:19.459
Hadassah Marcus: Yes.

00:26:19.459 --> 00:26:20.326
David Boder: Nu?

00:26:20.326 --> 00:26:25.583
Hadassah Marcus: But in Auschwitz I had the opportunity, having been a year and a half in Auschwitz...

00:26:25.583 --> 00:26:26.148
David Boder: Hm.

00:26:26.148 --> 00:26:27.287
Hadassah Marcus: . . . around two years.

00:26:27.287 --> 00:26:28.094
David Boder: Hm.

00:26:28.094 --> 00:26:31.900
Hadassah Marcus: . . . that I had my block vis-a-vis the crematory.

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:32.112
David Boder: Hm.

00:26:32.112 --> 00:26:37.429
Hadassah Marcus: Perhaps thirty meters separated the crematory from me [my place].

00:26:37.429 --> 00:26:39.807
David Boder: Yes?

00:26:39.807 --> 00:26:46.867
Hadassah Marcus: I had the occassion to witness everything. We are all living witnesses to what they have done.

00:26:46.867 --> 00:26:50.100
David Boder: How did you...you could see it through the windows, or what?

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.891
Hadassah Marcus: It was entirely open.

00:26:51.891 --> 00:26:52.275
David Boder: Hm.

00:26:52.275 --> 00:27:01.178
Hadassah Marcus: They didn’t even have the understanding that they should cover it up. Quite late they covered [it] with small trees so that we shouldn’t be able to see everything and hear everything.

00:27:01.178 --> 00:27:01.752
David Boder: Hm.

00:27:01.752 --> 00:27:15.036
Hadassah Marcus: The transports arrived there, huge transports. In ten minutes on the clock we already saw the fire coming from the chimneys. We recognized the transports, whether they were fat or lean [people].

00:27:15.036 --> 00:27:15.843
David Boder: By what?

00:27:15.843 --> 00:27:21.000
Hadassah Marcus: Because the smoke...if a black smoke was coming from the chimney it was a lean transport.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:21.483
David Boder: Hm.

00:27:21.483 --> 00:27:41.504
Hadassah Marcus: When [they were] fat, there was a huge fire going that could be seen from distances of tens of kilometers. In Auschwitz there were five ovens. Not far from Auschwitz there was Brzezinki with four ovens, but there were seasons when the nine ovens weren’t able...to work this out, to burn this...

00:27:41.504 --> 00:27:42.250
David Boder: Hm.

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:47.256
Hadassah Marcus: . . . as many transport as there were, [so] they made...dug out ditches and almost as if entirely...

00:27:47.256 --> 00:27:47.699
David Boder: Pits.

00:27:47.699 --> 00:27:51.000
Hadassah Marcus: Pits...almost as if people entirely alive were burned.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.736
David Boder: How...how...without having the people gassed?

00:27:53.736 --> 00:28:00.611
Hadassah Marcus: At the end they were giving very little gas. The people were only like they would have lost their equilibrium [consciousness].

00:28:00.611 --> 00:28:00.860
David Boder: Yes.

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:03.072
Hadassah Marcus: They even begrudged [them] a little gas.

00:28:03.072 --> 00:28:03.848
David Boder: Hm.

00:28:03.848 --> 00:28:09.877
Hadassah Marcus: We had the occassion to hear all the cries of Shema Yisroeil [the prayer of distress and profession of faith] and sometimes the singing of the Hatikvah [national anthem of Israel].

00:28:09.877 --> 00:28:10.347
David Boder: What?

00:28:10.347 --> 00:28:11.858
Hadassah Marcus: And sometimes the singing of the Hatikvah.

00:28:11.858 --> 00:28:13.849
David Boder: Hm.

00:28:13.849 --> 00:28:38.206
Hadassah Marcus: We had...I myself saw how the oven was being opened and the people were being pushed in. At each time I also had the occassion to see how the gassed people were lying completely outside, a whole heap. Because in the beginning we thought that maybe it is just the people’s clothing, only when we came closer we saw [they were] all gassed people.

00:28:38.206 --> 00:28:41.063
David Boder: You happened to pass by, yourself? You...how did you...

00:28:41.063 --> 00:28:43.709
Hadassah Marcus: No. Our Kommando [detail] had passed through that time...

00:28:43.709 --> 00:28:44.733
David Boder: Hm, yes.

00:28:44.733 --> 00:28:45.858
Hadassah Marcus: . . . through that road.

00:28:45.858 --> 00:28:46.721
David Boder: Hm.

00:28:46.721 --> 00:28:49.269
Hadassah Marcus: So we had observed quite well. If we were brought...

00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:51.361
David Boder: Your...your kommando had passed by.

00:28:51.361 --> 00:28:51.862
Hadassah Marcus: Yes.

00:28:51.862 --> 00:28:52.846
David Boder: It could be seen. Nu?

00:28:52.846 --> 00:30:07.892
Hadassah Marcus: If we were brought to the Nurenberg Trials, they would definitely have no defense whatsoever. They would absolutely be unable to disclaim anything against us. Because it couldn’t be imagined that we will be let out at liberty, and what such living witnesses could give the world. There were also cases that out of giant transports nobody, nobody was let in alive into the lager. Children were altogether out of the question. If they want to claim that they were burning only weak people, the living witnesses can tell that they took away from us the most beautiful, the youngest, the healthiest people, who were still sufficiently capable and strong for work. There was a time when they installed a children’s block. The children were given of the finest and the best, but it was only when they had to present proof for an inspection or such. During one nice, bright morning the children were taken away and all burned.

00:30:07.892 --> 00:30:10.285
David Boder: What? The entire children’s block?

00:30:10.285 --> 00:30:10.850
Hadassah Marcus: Yes.

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:11.264
David Boder: Hm .

00:30:11.264 --> 00:30:13.158
Hadassah Marcus: The children’s block lasted only for a short time.

00:30:13.158 --> 00:30:16.633
David Boder: Hm. How many do you estimate were there?

00:30:16.633 --> 00:30:19.101
Hadassah Marcus: Children there were in untold numbers.

00:30:19.101 --> 00:30:20.361
David Boder: Hm.

00:30:20.361 --> 00:31:02.066
Hadassah Marcus: Because this we can’t...we can’t fix the statistics, how many children there had been. We only know how many children we have missing. And as many as there are missing, that many had gone into the oven. Cases of [natural] death, there were very few. People didn’t die at all. They didn’t allow them to die. They didn’t permit us to get sick and die like human beings. There were times when we were given bread and we didn’t even have time to eat the bread, because directly from work they were leading [people] into the crematory. [Pause.]

00:31:02.066 --> 00:31:03.900
David Boder: Nu?

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:39.033
Hadassah Marcus: In the year 1945...it was also on the 18th, 1st month, i.e., the 18th of January, when the Russians were already standing behind our backs. We were aroused from sleep in the middle of the night, and we had to march on foot. In that night we covered thirty kilometers, without any rest, running, not walking. We weren’t give anything for the road. We were told to take along our Kotzen, but we had to throw it away in the middle of the road, because the [our] strength had given out.

00:31:39.033 --> 00:31:40.263
David Boder: What were you told to take along?

00:31:40.263 --> 00:31:41.553
Hadassah Marcus: Kotzen, nothing else.

00:31:41.553 --> 00:31:43.305
David Boder: The...what is Kotzen?

00:31:43.305 --> 00:31:43.607
Hadassah Marcus: Blankets.

00:31:43.607 --> 00:31:44.641
David Boder: Blankets. Yes.

00:31:44.641 --> 00:31:46.152
David Boder: You threw it away, and...

00:31:46.152 --> 00:31:51.426
Hadassah Marcus: In the middle of the road, because we had no strength to carry it along. We were too exhausted.

00:31:51.426 --> 00:31:53.729
David Boder: Hm.

00:31:53.729 --> 00:32:34.339
Hadassah Marcus: If one wanted to rest a moment on the road, if he only gave a bow with the head, he was taken out and immediately shot. Very many men fell at that time, more than women. After covering that night thirty kilometers, we were given in the morning fifteen minutes to rest. After that we walked a whole day, again a whole night, and were loaded into RR-cars. He who couldn’t make it so fast into the RR-cars was also taken away and shot. In RR-cars we traveled five days, in entirely open RR-cars. Then...

00:32:34.339 --> 00:32:35.514
David Boder: In what month was it?

00:32:35.514 --> 00:32:38.465
Hadassah Marcus: It was in the year ’45 in the first month.

00:32:38.465 --> 00:32:39.127
David Boder: In January.

00:32:39.127 --> 00:32:39.406
Hadassah Marcus: In January.

00:32:39.406 --> 00:32:42.112
David Boder: You traveled in open RR-cars. Nu?

00:32:42.112 --> 00:32:58.384
Hadassah Marcus: We nourished ourselves [lived on] during the entire five days with a little snow. One from another stole a little snow, because even that we weren’t given the possibility of having. We were packed in very many, so that there was no place to sit down. We had to stand.

00:32:58.384 --> 00:33:00.184
David Boder: Were there SS in each RR-car?

00:33:00.184 --> 00:33:02.696
Hadassah Marcus: Yes, each RR-car was guarded by SS men.

00:33:02.696 --> 00:33:05.170
David Boder: And where did they ride? Did they stand, too?

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:09.604
Hadassah Marcus: They had a place for themselves already where they could lie down quietly.

00:33:09.604 --> 00:33:10.477
David Boder: In the same wagon?

00:33:10.477 --> 00:33:13.827
Hadassah Marcus: In the same wagon, yes. Each wagon had to have guards.

00:33:13.827 --> 00:33:16.644
David Boder: Nu? Did they mark off a place for themselves, or what?

00:33:16.644 --> 00:33:17.437
Hadassah Marcus: Yes.

00:33:17.437 --> 00:33:18.862
David Boder: How did they do it?

00:33:18.862 --> 00:33:21.397
Hadassah Marcus: They had already their bench...

00:33:21.397 --> 00:33:21.787
David Boder: Hm.

00:33:21.787 --> 00:33:23.234
Hadassah Marcus: . . . already arranged.

00:33:23.234 --> 00:33:23.673
David Boder: Nu?

00:33:23.673 --> 00:33:32.323
Hadassah Marcus: After five days of travel, we were standing more than traveling. Whether it was raining or snowing we traveled uncovered. When one needed...the human need...

00:33:32.323 --> 00:33:33.854
David Boder: Hm.

00:33:33.854 --> 00:33:46.885
Hadassah Marcus: There wasn’t any [toilet] either. We were also not given the possibility for that. We had to...if one had a little container...

00:33:46.885 --> 00:33:47.446
David Boder: A what?

00:33:47.446 --> 00:33:49.178
Hadassah Marcus: If one had a can...

00:33:49.178 --> 00:33:49.457
David Boder: Yes?

00:33:49.457 --> 00:33:50.870
Hadassah Marcus: . . . to do what one had to...

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:52.532
David Boder: Hm.

00:33:52.532 --> 00:33:58.301
Hadassah Marcus: After five days of dragging us around in such a way we arrived in Ravensbruck.

00:33:58.301 --> 00:33:59.855
David Boder: Oh, you were in Ravensbruck?

00:33:59.855 --> 00:34:00.228
Hadassah Marcus: Yes.

00:34:00.228 --> 00:34:02.066
David Boder: Yes?

00:34:02.066 --> 00:34:13.223
Hadassah Marcus: In Ravensbruck we lived under threatening conditions—dirty, not [having] eaten, again beaten.

00:34:13.223 --> 00:34:15.506
David Boder: Beaten? Who?

00:34:15.506 --> 00:34:18.101
Hadassah Marcus: Everything, SS men and capos.

00:34:18.101 --> 00:34:19.903
David Boder: Were the capos men or women?

00:34:19.903 --> 00:34:21.162
Hadassah Marcus: Men and women, various...

00:34:21.162 --> 00:34:22.811
David Boder: And who were those capos?

00:34:22.811 --> 00:34:24.027
Hadassah Marcus: Prisoners.

00:34:24.027 --> 00:34:25.414
David Boder: Jews or what?

00:34:25.414 --> 00:34:27.969
Hadassah Marcus: Various ones. Germans, gentiles, and Jews.

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:31.085
David Boder: Hm.

00:34:31.085 --> 00:34:41.003
Hadassah Marcus: In Auschwitz we were beaten with clubs that could have fifteen centimeters in thickness [circumference?] .

00:34:41.003 --> 00:34:41.916
David Boder: Hm.

00:34:41.916 --> 00:34:42.843
Hadassah Marcus: There were cases sometimes...

00:34:42.843 --> 00:34:44.525
David Boder: What do you mean, thick?

00:34:44.525 --> 00:34:45.086
Hadassah Marcus: Thick.

00:34:45.086 --> 00:34:45.758
David Boder: Yes.

00:34:45.758 --> 00:34:48.867
Hadassah Marcus: There were cases when we were sitting in the bath in the nude.

00:34:48.867 --> 00:34:49.287
David Boder: Hm.

00:34:49.287 --> 00:34:53.483
Hadassah Marcus: We were beaten with such sticks without any why or wherefore.

00:34:53.483 --> 00:34:54.855
David Boder: Did men enter the bath?

00:34:54.855 --> 00:34:56.071
Hadassah Marcus: Women.

00:34:56.071 --> 00:34:57.035
David Boder: Women. What did they beat you for?

00:34:57.035 --> 00:35:06.742
Hadassah Marcus: For nothing. [Pause.] It is quite clearly written up in various books who did that and how they...what all their names were.

00:35:06.742 --> 00:35:09.218
David Boder: Yes? nu.

00:35:09.218 --> 00:35:43.337
Hadassah Marcus: But in Ravensbruck the same things met us. But with this still worse, that we didn’t even have anywhere to sleep, because there was no good reason. After four weeks of being in Ravensbruck, we were again sent to Neustadt. This is seventy kilometers past Berlin. There was an entirely new lager, an entirely new lager where we didn’t have any conveniences, the most necessary that a man has to have. And we again met up with blows and with beatings.

00:35:43.337 --> 00:35:44.986
David Boder: Did you work there?

00:35:44.986 --> 00:36:07.244
Hadassah Marcus: Not at the beginning. There was a commandant whose greatest pleasure was—he was a great sadist—if he could, without any reason, passing by beat up someone completely so that he couldn’t get up any more. Later on work began. People were assigned to ammunition factories.

00:36:07.244 --> 00:36:09.275
David Boder: Hm.

00:36:09.275 --> 00:36:11.634
Hadassah Marcus: . . . and to dig trenches.

00:36:11.634 --> 00:36:12.084
David Boder: Hm.

00:36:12.084 --> 00:36:14.451
Hadassah Marcus: I worked at the trenches...

00:36:14.451 --> 00:36:15.848
David Boder: Hm.

00:36:15.848 --> 00:36:26.215
Hadassah Marcus: . . . in such difficult...in such difficult conditions. Lately we received eight dekas of bread a day. We walked to work seven to eight kilometers.

00:36:26.215 --> 00:36:27.998
David Boder: Hm.

00:36:27.998 --> 00:36:31.671
Hadassah Marcus: And on the second of May we were liberated from there.

00:36:31.671 --> 00:36:33.168
David Boder: Who entered?

00:36:33.168 --> 00:36:37.589
Hadassah Marcus: First the Americans entered to us, later the Russians.

00:36:37.589 --> 00:36:44.240
David Boder: And so tell me about the last few days. How was it? Did you notice that you are going to be liberated? How was it?

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:47.691
Hadassah Marcus: Rumors reached us...

00:36:47.691 --> 00:36:48.305
David Boder: Yes.

00:36:48.305 --> 00:37:08.685
Hadassah Marcus: . . . that the liberation is at hand. But we were already so resigned from everything, because we didn’t imagine that some day will come the happy moment, possibly the unhappy [moment], because we had not lived to see any happiness anyway. Every one of us remained entirely alone.

00:37:08.685 --> 00:37:09.175
David Boder: Nu?

00:37:09.175 --> 00:37:22.598
Hadassah Marcus: But the moment of liberation did come. It could be noticed. A few minutes before, before the Americans entered to us, all the SS men disappeared, and we remained alone.

00:37:22.598 --> 00:37:24.236
David Boder: They didn’t tell you anything?

00:37:24.236 --> 00:37:33.721
Hadassah Marcus: Didn’t say anything. They didn’t tell us anything. Still, it was lucky for us that they didn’t take us out of the lager so that we should have to walk farther, that we weren’t chased...

00:37:33.721 --> 00:37:34.074
David Boder: [Word not clear.]

00:37:34.074 --> 00:37:35.944
Hadassah Marcus: . . . so that we were liberated at the place.

00:37:35.944 --> 00:37:36.297
David Boder: Hm.

00:37:36.297 --> 00:37:41.631
Hadassah Marcus: Because if they would move us at that time, not even ten per cent of us would have remained.

00:37:41.631 --> 00:37:42.457
David Boder: Why?

00:37:42.457 --> 00:37:53.328
Hadassah Marcus: Because the people were so much exhausted. People were sitting and eating grass from hunger. We didn’t even have the strength to get up.

00:37:53.328 --> 00:37:58.280
David Boder: So how...who...in the morning the Americans came in? Who had come in?

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:02.416
Hadassah Marcus: First the Americans. They drove through and calmed us.

00:38:02.416 --> 00:38:03.954
David Boder: Hm. Did they come...

00:38:03.954 --> 00:38:04.336
Hadassah Marcus: And afterwards.

00:38:04.336 --> 00:38:05.495
David Boder: . . . in automobiles or tanks?

00:38:05.495 --> 00:38:06.630
Hadassah Marcus: In automobiles.

00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:07.251
David Boder: Yes?

00:38:07.251 --> 00:38:10.108
Hadassah Marcus: And later on the Russians arrived. And the Russians remained.

00:38:10.108 --> 00:38:10.991
David Boder: Hm.

00:38:10.991 --> 00:38:13.630
Hadassah Marcus: Eight kilometers from us the Americans remained...

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:14.137
David Boder: [Words not clear.]

00:38:14.137 --> 00:38:15.816
Hadassah Marcus: . . . standing in Ludwigs [Ludwigslust].

00:38:15.816 --> 00:38:16.968
David Boder: Yes?

00:38:16.968 --> 00:38:17.378
Hadassah Marcus: And by us the Russians.

00:38:17.378 --> 00:38:19.913
David Boder: Didn’t you see? Did they catch any of the SS?

00:38:19.913 --> 00:38:25.056
Hadassah Marcus: Nothing. We didn’t see anything. All the Germans women were released half an hour before.

00:38:25.056 --> 00:38:25.416
David Boder: Hm.

00:38:25.416 --> 00:38:26.873
Hadassah Marcus: All the German prisoners.

00:38:26.873 --> 00:38:27.890
David Boder: Oh, the prisoners were released.

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:29.045
Hadassah Marcus: Yes. The German [ones] only.

00:38:29.045 --> 00:38:30.354
David Boder: Did you see them do it?

00:38:30.354 --> 00:38:30.868
David Boder: Yes.

00:38:30.868 --> 00:38:31.842
David Boder: Did you know why?

00:38:31.842 --> 00:38:35.817
Hadassah Marcus: Yes. The entire day we knew that they were already quite near.

00:38:35.817 --> 00:38:36.187
David Boder: Hm.

00:38:36.187 --> 00:38:42.129
Hadassah Marcus: They broke open the magazines then. They still had time to shoot one gentile girl.

00:38:42.129 --> 00:38:42.239
David Boder: Why?

00:38:42.239 --> 00:38:43.806
Hadassah Marcus: Because she had come close to the magazine.

00:38:43.806 --> 00:38:44.154
David Boder: The SS?

00:38:44.154 --> 00:38:45.159
Hadassah Marcus: The SS men.

00:38:45.159 --> 00:38:45.309
David Boder: Yes.

00:38:45.309 --> 00:38:47.732
Hadassah Marcus: That was perhaps half an hour before the liberation.

00:38:47.732 --> 00:38:52.611
David Boder: Yes? Did you see airplanes first? Was the lager bombed?

00:38:52.611 --> 00:38:55.655
Hadassah Marcus: No, not on that day. That day was entirely quiet.

00:38:55.655 --> 00:38:57.776
David Boder: But before?

00:38:57.776 --> 00:39:01.896
Hadassah Marcus: Before, yes. Before we had great bombings, but the lager it didn’t damage.

00:39:01.896 --> 00:39:02.465
David Boder: Hm.

00:39:02.465 --> 00:39:07.495
Hadassah Marcus: In our lager there was...how large was the lager? It wasn’t a large one.

00:39:07.495 --> 00:39:07.972
David Boder: Hm.

00:39:07.972 --> 00:39:11.088
Hadassah Marcus: And under the entire underground was hidden gasoline.

00:39:11.088 --> 00:39:12.460
David Boder: Oh. Hm.

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:17.390
Hadassah Marcus: We ourselves had to make...to build tunnels in order to hide the gasoline.

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:18.913
David Boder: In what was it kept? In cans?

00:39:18.913 --> 00:39:19.511
Hadassah Marcus: In cans.

00:39:19.511 --> 00:39:22.441
David Boder: Yes? Nu? Did the Americans take it afterwards?

00:39:22.441 --> 00:39:23.129
Hadassah Marcus: I don’t know.

00:39:23.129 --> 00:39:23.707
David Boder: Yes.

00:39:23.707 --> 00:39:27.049
Hadassah Marcus: Because immediately after, we moved some place else.

00:39:27.049 --> 00:39:28.401
David Boder: Where did they take you to?

00:39:28.401 --> 00:39:30.024
Hadassah Marcus: Nu, everyone separetely.

00:39:30.024 --> 00:39:31.587
David Boder: How long did you still remain in the lager?

00:39:31.587 --> 00:39:37.321
Hadassah Marcus: I was still in the lager two days, but right outside the lager in the house where the SS men had lived...

00:39:37.321 --> 00:39:37.607
David Boder: Yes.

00:39:37.607 --> 00:39:43.404
Hadassah Marcus: . . . we lived for another few weeks, because we simply had to come to ourselves so that we might have the strength to go on.

00:39:43.404 --> 00:39:44.907
David Boder: Hm. And that was under the Russians.

00:39:44.907 --> 00:39:45.646
Hadassah Marcus: Yes.

00:39:45.646 --> 00:39:49.500
David Boder: Nu, and where did you go to from the lager?

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:53.997
Hadassah Marcus: From the lager we went then...traveled on foot, everyone with a little cart.

00:39:53.997 --> 00:39:55.650
David Boder: How is that? Where did you find a little cart?

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:59.519
Hadassah Marcus: We procured some...we organized [appropriated] from the Germans, that which we had taken away from the Germans

00:39:59.519 --> 00:40:00.067
David Boder: Hm.

00:40:00.067 --> 00:40:00.554
Hadassah Marcus: Because there were living many...

00:40:00.554 --> 00:40:01.328
David Boder: Hand carts.

00:40:01.328 --> 00:40:09.009
Hadassah Marcus: Yes. There were many German civilians. We walked for about ten kilometers, and later we met a cart...

00:40:09.009 --> 00:40:09.587
David Boder: Hm.

00:40:09.587 --> 00:40:12.635
Hadassah Marcus: . . . on which were riding people, and they took us one.

00:40:12.635 --> 00:40:12.766
David Boder: Hm. What does it mean...

00:40:12.766 --> 00:40:13.454
Hadassah Marcus: And we traveled together with them.

00:40:13.454 --> 00:40:15.598
David Boder: . . . ‘us’? Who was with you?

00:40:15.598 --> 00:40:19.593
Hadassah Marcus: with me there were a few more girls. The sister, too, was there.

00:40:19.593 --> 00:40:20.111
David Boder: Your sister?

00:40:20.111 --> 00:40:20.558
Hadassah Marcus: Yes.

00:40:20.558 --> 00:40:21.413
David Boder: Nu?

00:40:21.413 --> 00:40:25.579
Hadassah Marcus: And a few more young girls who I had to keep under my protection.

00:40:25.579 --> 00:40:27.353
David Boder: Hm. And...

00:40:27.353 --> 00:40:30.514
Hadassah Marcus: Everyone was traveling separately to one’s home.

00:40:30.514 --> 00:40:34.971
David Boder: Yes. What did the Germans say when you took their little carts? Or...

00:40:34.971 --> 00:40:38.966
Hadassah Marcus: Many were still so shameless [insolent] that they didn’t permit it.

00:40:38.966 --> 00:40:39.765
David Boder: Yes?

00:40:39.765 --> 00:40:42.755
Hadassah Marcus: But they were at that time full of fear.

00:40:42.755 --> 00:40:43.624
David Boder: Yes?

00:40:43.624 --> 00:40:50.483
Hadassah Marcus: And they were simply afraid of us. They had to let us do whatever we wanted.

00:40:50.483 --> 00:40:51.362
David Boder: Hm.

00:40:51.362 --> 00:40:53.858
Hadassah Marcus: Later they created for themsleves a militia [an organization for selfprotection].

00:40:53.858 --> 00:40:54.446
David Boder: The Germans?

00:40:54.446 --> 00:40:55.004
Hadassah Marcus: Yes.

00:40:55.004 --> 00:40:55.547
David Boder: And?

00:40:55.547 --> 00:41:02.828
Hadassah Marcus: That must have come from the government that existed at that time so that nothing should be taken away from them any more.

00:41:02.828 --> 00:41:08.089
David Boder: Hm. Nu? And then you took a cart and went where?

00:41:08.089 --> 00:41:13.991
Hadassah Marcus: Then we traveled towards Stargard, and from there we traveled by train to Lodz.

00:41:13.991 --> 00:41:14.147
David Boder: Oh.

00:41:14.147 --> 00:41:22.105
Hadassah Marcus: Because to Warsaw I had no reason to go. I was given reports that Warsaw was, as it is in fact, an empty, desolate field.

00:41:22.105 --> 00:41:22.472
David Boder: Hm.

00:41:22.472 --> 00:41:26.199
Hadassah Marcus: And unfortunately I knew that I won’t find anyone of the family any more.

00:41:26.199 --> 00:41:26.586
David Boder: So you...

00:41:26.586 --> 00:41:28.581
Hadassah Marcus: So I settled in Lodz.

00:41:28.581 --> 00:41:28.882
David Boder: Who: You.

00:41:28.882 --> 00:41:29.189
Hadassah Marcus: In Lo...

00:41:29.189 --> 00:41:29.576
David Boder: . . . and your sister.

00:41:29.576 --> 00:41:30.908
Hadassah Marcus: I and the sister.

00:41:30.908 --> 00:41:31.114
David Boder: Nu?

00:41:31.114 --> 00:41:41.512
Hadassah Marcus: And the few girls that I had with me. But they right away found some relatives and some friends from their towns, and they got settled.

00:41:41.512 --> 00:41:42.793
David Boder: Nu?

00:41:42.793 --> 00:41:51.844
Hadassah Marcus: Not finding anyone even in Lodz, we joined, I being a comrade [member] of Agudah Yisroeil...a member of Agudah yisroeil...

00:41:51.844 --> 00:41:53.040
David Boder: Were you always with them?

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:55.377
Hadassah Marcus: Yes. From before the war.

00:41:55.377 --> 00:41:55.684
David Boder: Yes?

00:41:55.684 --> 00:42:15.851
Hadassah Marcus: We began to search for our people. And we found, although it was very hard for us, and we began to do our work. Because we saw that we have to create a home for those people who are returning now from the lagers, who were greatly broken up, everyone by himself [alone].

00:42:15.851 --> 00:42:19.434
David Boder: Hm. And so?

00:42:19.434 --> 00:42:31.284
Hadassah Marcus: We created the first Kibbutz in Lodz of Agudah Yisroeil. I was [one] of the first who opened the Kibbutz. Since that time...

00:42:31.284 --> 00:42:33.795
David Boder: How many people joined that Kibbutz?

00:42:33.795 --> 00:42:37.117
Hadassah Marcus: When I opened the Kibbutz I was with four people.

00:42:37.117 --> 00:42:37.494
David Boder: Hm.

00:42:37.494 --> 00:42:39.459
Hadassah Marcus: I was the fifth.

00:42:39.459 --> 00:42:41.243
David Boder: What did you live on?

00:42:41.243 --> 00:42:46.313
Hadassah Marcus: In the Kibbutz at the beginning we lived on that which was collected for us.

00:42:46.313 --> 00:42:47.582
David Boder: Hm.

00:42:47.582 --> 00:42:52.338
Hadassah Marcus: And later we began to find means from various sources.

00:42:52.338 --> 00:42:52.705
David Boder: Hm.

00:42:52.705 --> 00:43:08.299
Hadassah Marcus: Nu, there had arrived more people, and by joint work we were able to create a home for all those who were completely alone after returning from the lagers. And that is how we were living in the Kibbutz.

00:43:08.299 --> 00:43:09.928
David Boder: Hm. Already in Lodz.

00:43:09.928 --> 00:43:11.010
Hadassah Marcus: Already in Lodz.

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:11.798
David Boder: Yes?

00:43:11.798 --> 00:43:30.670
Hadassah Marcus: We saw to it that as far as possible we should be able to send people out of Poland, there where our air is, to Eretz Yisroeil. Because in spite of all we didn’t have a peaceful life in Poland. A Jew couldn’t go peacefully out in the street. There had begun again carnages and again slaughters.

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:40.085
David Boder: How do you explain it? The Poles wanted to be free of the Germans. They knew that the German was attacking the Jews. How does it come that a Pole should do the same thing?

00:43:40.085 --> 00:44:06.611
Hadassah Marcus: That’s hopeless. He [the German] has left a legacy which, it seems like, will remain in Poland, in spite of the government being strongly against it. But it isn’t strong enough to stand up against the dark masses which still reign and maintain themselves in Poland. And before Pesach [Passover] we succeeded in tearing ourselves through and coming to France.

00:44:06.611 --> 00:44:14.427
David Boder: With whom did you...where did you meet the rabbi, the Rabbi Hochman, or what is his name? The rabbi who is here.

00:44:14.427 --> 00:44:15.515
Hadassah Marcus: Rabbi Horowitz?

00:44:15.515 --> 00:44:16.663
David Boder: Rabbi Horowitz, yes. [See Chapter 42, Rabbi Horowitz].

00:44:16.663 --> 00:44:20.210
Hadassah Marcus: Rabbi Horowitz came from Russia, from the partisans...

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:21.082
David Boder: Hm.

00:44:21.082 --> 00:44:22.224
Hadassah Marcus: . . . to Lodz.

00:44:22.224 --> 00:44:23.577
David Boder: Oh, and?

00:44:23.577 --> 00:44:28.939
Hadassah Marcus: And at that time we began working together. Later he was taken as Rabbi of Warsaw.

00:44:28.939 --> 00:44:29.240
David Boder: Yes?

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:35.769
Hadassah Marcus: But in Warsaw a Jew with a beard could not go out in peace. When he would leave his house he had to have police with him...

00:44:35.769 --> 00:44:35.986
David Boder: Hm.

00:44:35.986 --> 00:44:37.002
Hadassah Marcus: . . . that he should be guarded.

00:44:37.002 --> 00:44:37.519
David Boder: Hm.

00:44:37.519 --> 00:44:43.104
Hadassah Marcus: And we simply spirited him away from Warsaw when the possibility arose to leave for France...

00:44:43.104 --> 00:44:43.481
David Boder: Oh.

00:44:43.481 --> 00:44:45.287
Hadassah Marcus: . . . on the way to Eretz Yisroeil.

00:44:45.287 --> 00:44:45.630
David Boder: Hm.

00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:48.207
Hadassah Marcus: And that was the objective of the Agudah.

00:44:48.207 --> 00:44:49.620
David Boder: Hm.

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:59.872
Hadassah Marcus: And now we sit in Henonville and wait for an Alliyah, not caring which way we go to Eretz Yisroeil. The troubles don’t scare us that are happening there.

00:44:59.872 --> 00:45:01.537
David Boder: Is your sister here with you?

00:45:01.537 --> 00:45:06.427
Hadassah Marcus: The sister is still in Poland. She does not have the possibility of coming yet. Probably she will come.

00:45:06.427 --> 00:45:08.132
David Boder: Why did she remain there?

00:45:08.132 --> 00:45:09.336
Hadassah Marcus: She go married.

00:45:09.336 --> 00:45:10.049
David Boder: Oh.

00:45:10.049 --> 00:45:12.636
Hadassah Marcus: She is still quite a young child. She is eighteen years old.

00:45:12.636 --> 00:45:13.590
David Boder: Yes.

00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:21.101
Hadassah Marcus: And she couldn’t travel together with me. After us more people were supposed to arrive, but it had been upset. We were informed on.

00:45:21.101 --> 00:45:22.035
David Boder: So?

00:45:22.035 --> 00:45:25.253
Hadassah Marcus: Yes. Nu, possibly she will come now.

00:45:25.253 --> 00:45:28.912
David Boder: Why were you informed on? Why can’t people travel?

00:45:28.912 --> 00:45:32.952
Hadassah Marcus: There are found already...because they don’t want to let us out of Poland.

00:45:32.952 --> 00:45:34.086
David Boder: Why not?

00:45:34.086 --> 00:45:49.051
Hadassah Marcus: Because they understand that Jews are still quite useful to them. Because all that is ill in Poland, all that, is being reconstructed. Jewish hands are doing the reconstruction. Without us they know they won’t accomplish anything. And again there exists the Jewish Committee in Poland

00:45:49.051 --> 00:45:49.279
David Boder: Yes.

00:45:49.279 --> 00:45:54.782
Hadassah Marcus: . . . which had been founded. It stands on guard so as not to let out a single Jew from Poland [apparently a government council on Jewish affairs].

00:45:54.782 --> 00:45:57.550
David Boder: Why? The Jewish Committee is...doesn’t want that Jews should...

00:45:57.550 --> 00:46:04.025
Hadassah Marcus: I don’t know what kind of ideas they have. They say that one lives entirely peacefully and well in Poland, [that] one doesn’t have to go to Ereta Yisroei.

00:46:04.025 --> 00:46:04.288
David Boder: Hm.

00:46:04.288 --> 00:46:08.780
Hadassah Marcus: We didn’t become legalized either, because they hindered us.

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:09.804
David Boder: The Jewish Committee?

00:46:09.804 --> 00:46:10.377
Hadassah Marcus: Yes.

00:46:10.377 --> 00:46:10.630
David Boder: Nu?

00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:17.000
Hadassah Marcus: We had to be on guard against the Jewish Committee with each and every transport that we smuggled out of Poland.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.365
David Boder: Hm.

00:46:18.365 --> 00:46:33.039
Hadassah Marcus: They stand [against] us all the time and hinder us in that work. Now we sit in Henonvilleand wait again for an Alliyah, not caring what the road will be. At the first opportunity we go on.

00:46:33.039 --> 00:46:37.732
David Boder: How did you travel from the Polish border to here? You were first in Czechoslovakia?

00:46:37.732 --> 00:46:38.255
Hadassah Marcus: Yes, in Czechoslovakia. In Prague.

00:46:38.255 --> 00:46:39.910
David Boder: How long were you in Czechoslovakia?

00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:40.804
Hadassah Marcus: Two weeks

00:46:40.804 --> 00:46:43.030
David Boder: Two weeks? And then you...how did you travel?

00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:43.884
Hadassah Marcus: To France.

00:46:43.884 --> 00:46:45.269
David Boder: By busses?

00:46:45.269 --> 00:46:50.108
Hadassah Marcus: We traveled second class [good accommodations], thanks to the efforts of the Agudah [possibly by train].

00:46:50.108 --> 00:46:51.252
David Boder: Hm.

00:46:51.252 --> 00:46:51.533
Hadassah Marcus: Very fine.

00:46:51.533 --> 00:46:52.878
David Boder: Who, the entire group?

00:46:52.878 --> 00:46:54.303
Hadassah Marcus: Not the entire group.

00:46:54.303 --> 00:46:54.535
David Boder: Who?

00:46:54.535 --> 00:46:56.721
Hadassah Marcus: Most of the group.

00:46:56.721 --> 00:46:56.853
David Boder: Hm.

00:46:56.853 --> 00:46:58.759
Hadassah Marcus: First went the [members of the] Kibbutzim.

00:46:58.759 --> 00:46:59.472
David Boder: Hm.

00:46:59.472 --> 00:47:01.946
Hadassah Marcus: With us were also private people.

00:47:01.946 --> 00:47:02.589
David Boder: You belong to a Kibbutz?

00:47:02.589 --> 00:47:04.084
Hadassah Marcus: But first...I am in a Kibbutz now?

00:47:04.084 --> 00:47:04.537
David Boder: Yes.

00:47:04.537 --> 00:47:04.840
Hadassah Marcus: Yes.

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:07.046
David Boder: And the private people were who?

00:47:07.046 --> 00:47:15.222
Hadassah Marcus: Also people of the Agudah, and various one. If there comes...but in first place the Kibbutzim people were taken.

00:47:15.222 --> 00:47:18.781
David Boder: Hm. And you had traveled through where? Through Germany?

00:47:18.781 --> 00:47:20.376
Hadassah Marcus: We traveled through Germany, too.

00:47:20.376 --> 00:47:22.592
David Boder: Did you stop...stayed there [word not clear]?

00:47:22.592 --> 00:47:24.648
Hadassah Marcus: No. We only passed through.

00:47:24.648 --> 00:47:25.231
David Boder: What?

00:47:25.231 --> 00:47:26.435
Hadassah Marcus: We only passed through.

00:47:26.435 --> 00:47:28.341
David Boder: Passed through, and then you came into France?

00:47:28.341 --> 00:47:29.305
Hadassah Marcus: To France, yes.

00:47:29.305 --> 00:47:32.814
David Boder: And how long do you think you will have to wait?

00:47:32.814 --> 00:47:38.648
Hadassah Marcus: We don’t know. These are things which we don’t know, how long...We have sent away already three transports to Eretz Yisroeil.

00:47:38.648 --> 00:47:39.582
David Boder: And did they arrive [reach their destination]?

00:47:39.582 --> 00:47:39.965
Hadassah Marcus: Yes.

00:47:39.965 --> 00:47:43.895
David Boder: Nu? [Words not clear.] And what do you do here?

00:47:43.895 --> 00:47:45.871
Hadassah Marcus: Here we work. It differs. Tailoring.

00:47:45.871 --> 00:47:47.316
David Boder: [Words not clear.] And you?

00:47:47.316 --> 00:47:48.679
Hadassah Marcus: I am the technical manager.

00:47:48.679 --> 00:47:51.597
David Boder: What...in what? In what?

00:47:51.597 --> 00:47:54.174
Hadassah Marcus: In...in the kitchen.

00:47:54.174 --> 00:47:55.739
David Boder: In the...the...in the kitchen

00:47:55.739 --> 00:47:56.883
Hadassah Marcus: Yes.

00:47:56.883 --> 00:47:57.657
David Boder: And the...

00:47:57.657 --> 00:47:59.543
Hadassah Marcus: No. Over the general order.

00:47:59.543 --> 00:47:59.675
David Boder: Hm.

00:47:59.675 --> 00:48:01.120
Hadassah Marcus: Simply that everything should be in good order.

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:02.605
David Boder: Over the women or everybody?

00:48:02.605 --> 00:48:05.934
Hadassah Marcus: Everybody.

00:48:05.934 --> 00:48:10.776
David Boder: Hm. Nu, is there anything more that you would want to tell us?

00:48:10.776 --> 00:48:14.085
Hadassah Marcus: [Pause.] What I have told are not the protim. It is...

00:48:14.085 --> 00:48:14.708
David Boder: What are protim?

00:48:14.708 --> 00:48:17.133
Hadassah Marcus: There are no protim, det-...details.

00:48:17.133 --> 00:48:17.677
David Boder: Yes.

00:48:17.677 --> 00:49:16.248
Hadassah Marcus: If one should want to relate the details, say about what one had lived through in one minute, one can sit and write a whole year. I figure that from the collected materials the world should know, and she can already form a picture [of] what had happened with us. And now the whole world should stand open for us with all...with all the forces with which they can help...help us so that we could arrive in Eretz Yisroeil. So that there we should be able to live our life fully and at least feel at home. Because no matter where it should be, we won’t be able to find peace. America is not for us. Belgium is not for us. The whole world is not for us, because there...there we won’t feel secure. We don’t demand much happiness from life any more, because we had too much unhappiness. We already have given too much of our share to the world. But still, now we want a peaceful life and for once to feel what it means to be in one’s home [homeland].

00:49:16.248 --> 00:49:17.319
David Boder: Hm.

00:49:17.319 --> 00:49:27.594
Hadassah Marcus: Maybe, because of that, we should be able to carry the responsibility for the generations which will come, that to them shouldn’t happen any more what has happened to us.

00:49:27.594 --> 00:49:38.935
David Boder: Nu, what do you think to...for instance, in...nu, yes. And what would you want that one should do for you?

00:49:38.935 --> 00:50:22.870
Hadassah Marcus: The world should see to fight that for us should be opened the gates of Eretz Yisroeil. We demand nothing more. We still are quite capable people. The world shouldn’t think that that we are crippled, backward [?]. There is yet much energy in us, because there is the will for revenge in us, which we cannot use up, because we are not able to. We have to do too much and work too much and shed too much blood, so that our Jewish consciecce and our Jewish heart should be able to carry that out. Or led the world carry that out. Let the world take revenge on those who have ruined us completely.

00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:24.963
David Boder: Do you have relatives in America?

00:50:24.963 --> 00:50:26.225
Hadassah Marcus: I have relatives in America.

00:50:26.225 --> 00:50:27.377
David Boder: Where are they?

00:50:27.377 --> 00:50:29.130
Hadassah Marcus: One is in San Francisco, [and] one is in New York.

00:50:29.130 --> 00:50:30.212
David Boder: Hm.

00:50:30.212 --> 00:50:48.406
Hadassah Marcus: But till now I couldn’t get their address, because when we arrived in Majdanek they took everything away from us. We went in naked, and we were given already their clothing so that I don’t have their address. I would want very much to know their address.

00:50:48.406 --> 00:50:51.490
David Boder: Did you try to look for them through the HIAS?

00:50:51.490 --> 00:50:53.483
Hadassah Marcus: Through the HIAS? Not yet.

00:50:53.483 --> 00:50:56.407
David Boder: That is the best organization through which you can look for them.
