00:00:00.752 --> 00:00:27.554
David Boder: [In English] This is a record of Adam Krakowski, taken at the schools of the ORT in Paris, July 30, 1946. There is some interference. A typewriter is knocking in the other room, and noise comes in from the streets of Paris, but we just don’t have studio facilities, and we will have to make the best of it. At least the conditions are the natural ones.

00:00:27.554 --> 00:00:30.830
David Boder: [In German] How old are you, Mr. Krakowski?

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.158
Adam Krakowski: Twenty-one years.

00:00:32.158 --> 00:00:36.534
David Boder: You are twenty-one years [old]. And you were born in Lodz?

00:00:36.534 --> 00:00:37.621
Adam Krakowski: In Lodz.

00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:41.846
David Boder: Tell me, what were your parents?

00:00:41.846 --> 00:00:47.952
Adam Krakowski: My father worked in a textiles store.

00:00:47.952 --> 00:00:51.179
David Boder: He was working in a store. He did not have his own store.

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:51.857
Adam Krakowski: No, no.

00:00:51.857 --> 00:00:57.540
David Boder: No, and do you have brothers or sisters?

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.741
Adam Krakowski: Yes, I have a brother here in Paris.

00:00:59.741 --> 00:01:01.400
David Boder: You have a brother in Paris.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.626
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:01:01.626 --> 00:01:03.284
David Boder: Did he come together with you from Poland?

00:01:03.284 --> 00:01:06.601
Adam Krakowski: No, he was...he has lived in France already for twenty years.

00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:08.320
David Boder: He has lived in France already for twenty years.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.441
Adam Krakowski: The family in Poland is...are all dead.

00:01:11.441 --> 00:01:13.024
David Boder: How do you know that?

00:01:13.024 --> 00:01:14.697
Adam Krakowski: They were in the lager...

00:01:14.697 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: Hm.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Adam Krakowski: . . . in an extermination camp.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: Extermination camp?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:16.386
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:01:16.386 --> 00:01:20.592
David Boder: What is that?

00:01:20.592 --> 00:01:23.698
Adam Krakowski: Hm...crematories...gas chambers.

00:01:23.698 --> 00:01:27.391
David Boder: Hm. Where were these lagers?

00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:29.486
Adam Krakowski: In Poland. In Belzyc.

00:01:29.486 --> 00:01:30.120
David Boder: Where?

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.492
Adam Krakowski: In Belzyc.

00:01:31.492 --> 00:01:32.472
David Boder: Belzyc?

00:01:32.472 --> 00:01:33.482
Adam Krakowski: Yes, near Lublin.

00:01:33.482 --> 00:01:35.382
David Boder: Near Lublin.

00:01:35.382 --> 00:01:39.618
Adam Krakowski: There the parents were done away with. There I had a brother...

00:01:39.618 --> 00:01:40.583
David Boder: Yes.

00:01:40.583 --> 00:01:42.814
Adam Krakowski: . . . and also a sister.

00:01:42.814 --> 00:01:57.467
David Boder: And so, well...Would you tell me whatever you remember from the day when the Germans came to Poland. Go and tell us as much as you can. Talk about it just as you can. Go ahead.

00:01:57.467 --> 00:02:01.289
Adam Krakowski: For the first few months I was still going to school, in the year ’39.

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.284
David Boder: When did the Poles...when did the Germans come to Lodz?

00:02:05.284 --> 00:02:06.867
Adam Krakowski: In September, ’39.

00:02:06.867 --> 00:02:10.440
David Boder: Yes. Did you know that the Germans will come?

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.154
Adam Krakowski: No, only when the polish army broke down I already knew everything, but it was already too late...

00:02:16.154 --> 00:02:16.832
David Boder: Hm.

00:02:16.832 --> 00:02:18.129
Adam Krakowski: . . . to run away.

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.340
David Boder: Yes? Did many people run away?

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.230
Adam Krakowski: No, not many. Only later did many people run to Russia.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.913
David Boder: Hm. All right. So the Germans came. And so, tell us what happened then.

00:02:30.913 --> 00:02:47.496
Adam Krakowski: For a few months, I was still going to school. And then we were deported from Lodz. A group of SS officers came, took us to a lager, a temporary lager, and then deported us to [name of locality] in Galicia.

00:02:47.496 --> 00:02:50.995
David Boder: Tell me, did you know in Lodz a Doctor Falk?

00:02:50.995 --> 00:02:51.930
Adam Krakowski: Falk?

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.362
David Boder: Yes, Ludwig Falk.

00:02:53.362 --> 00:02:56.196
Adam Krakowski: [Pause.]

00:02:56.196 --> 00:03:01.985
David Boder: You did not know him. All right. Go on. All right. What do you mean by ‘you were deported’?

00:03:01.985 --> 00:03:15.191
Adam Krakowski: We were only allowed to take a rucksack and were sent over to another town, because Lodz was in the Third Reich and [name of locality not clear] was taken over by the general government.

00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:16.514
David Boder: What?

00:03:16.514 --> 00:03:22.273
Adam Krakowski: A part of Poland the German annexed to Germany...

00:03:22.273 --> 00:03:22.620
David Boder: Yes?

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.620
Adam Krakowski: . . . as a part of Germany, and the rest was the General Government [of occupation?].

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.027
David Boder: Yes? And where were the Jews sent?

00:03:29.027 --> 00:03:33.731
Adam Krakowski: A part of the Jews were sent to various towns in the General Government; not all [of them].

00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:35.193
David Boder: Hm, nu?

00:03:35.193 --> 00:03:37.485
Adam Krakowski: The rest remained in Lodz in the Ghetto.

00:03:37.485 --> 00:03:42.445
David Boder: Hm. How was the Ghetto arranged there? How was the Ghetto...

00:03:42.445 --> 00:03:52.350
Adam Krakowski: The worst part of the town was taken, and all the Jews were squeezed in there. There were, I believe, a hundred and forty thousand people inside quite a very small area.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.682
David Boder: And who had lived there before, in that...in that...

00:03:55.682 --> 00:04:02.059
Adam Krakowski: Various people. The Aryans were resettled, and all the...the Jews were squeezed together. And the Aryans...

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:05.361
David Boder: Were the Poles also called Aryans?

00:04:05.361 --> 00:04:05.738
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:04:05.738 --> 00:04:08.738
David Boder: Yes. And what did the Poles do?

00:04:08.738 --> 00:04:14.105
Adam Krakowski: They were resettled in the Jewish homes in the town outside the Ghetto.

00:04:14.105 --> 00:04:18.311
David Boder: Yes. Were the Poles...the Poles friendly toward the Jews?

00:04:18.311 --> 00:00:00.000
Adam Krakowski: [Chuckle.] Not very.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: Speak louder, please.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:04:21.176
Adam Krakowski: [Chuckle.] Not very.

00:04:21.176 --> 00:04:23.935
David Boder: Not so friendly.

00:04:23.935 --> 00:04:24.945
Adam Krakowski: Not so friendly.

00:04:24.945 --> 00:04:28.322
David Boder: And so, good. Nu, where did you then go?

00:04:28.322 --> 00:04:29.483
Adam Krakowski: To [name of city not clear, possily Neusatz].

00:04:29.483 --> 00:04:29.860
David Boder: What?

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.744
Adam Krakowski: To [Neusatz?].

00:04:31.744 --> 00:04:35.694
David Boder: To [Neusatz?] in Galicia. All right. And when you came there, what happened then?

00:04:35.694 --> 00:04:39.252
Adam Krakowski: I spent in that town four months.

00:04:39.252 --> 00:04:40.081
David Boder: Hm.

00:04:40.081 --> 00:04:45.719
Adam Krakowski: Then I went to a lager, and the parents still remained in the town.

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:47.515
David Boder: Where, in...

00:04:47.515 --> 00:04:48.614
Adam Krakowski: In [Neusatz?].

00:04:48.614 --> 00:04:49.398
David Boder: In [Neusatz?].

00:04:49.398 --> 00:04:52.339
Adam Krakowski: And I went to a labor lager to work.

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:56.123
David Boder: Yes. What did yo do during the four months in [Neusatz?].

00:04:56.123 --> 00:04:59.485
Adam Krakowski: At first we...the first few months we worked freely.

00:04:59.485 --> 00:05:00.495
David Boder: For whom?

00:05:00.495 --> 00:05:01.611
Adam Krakowski: For ourselves.

00:05:01.611 --> 00:05:02.923
David Boder: I mean, what did you do?

00:05:02.923 --> 00:05:05.893
Adam Krakowski: I, for example, was teaching children.

00:05:05.893 --> 00:05:06.722
David Boder: Yes?

00:05:06.722 --> 00:05:09.225
Adam Krakowski: Privately [words not clear].

00:05:09.225 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: You were teaching [tutoring]?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:05:10.356
Adam Krakowski: Teaching.

00:05:10.356 --> 00:05:11.487
David Boder: Jewish children?

00:05:11.487 --> 00:05:12.588
Adam Krakowski: Jewish children.

00:05:12.588 --> 00:05:14.895
David Boder: Yes. What did you teach them?

00:05:14.895 --> 00:05:17.654
Adam Krakowski: Normal [subjects]. There were no schools for Jews...

00:05:17.654 --> 00:05:18.061
David Boder: Hm.

00:05:18.061 --> 00:05:20.262
Adam Krakowski: . . . whatsoever...whatsoever.

00:05:20.262 --> 00:05:22.734
David Boder: And how did the people pay you?

00:05:22.734 --> 00:05:25.840
Adam Krakowski: Not well, but yet it was enough.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.569
David Boder: Where did they take the money to pay?

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:31.629
Adam Krakowski: The people had from before, from before the war.

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:37.780
David Boder: Hm. So you were teaching there. Nu, good. Then you went to a labor lager?

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.016
Adam Krakowski: To a labor lager.

00:05:39.016 --> 00:05:40.675
David Boder: Why? Were you forced to go?

00:05:40.675 --> 00:05:43.283
Adam Krakowski: Yes, all the young people [men?] went at that time.

00:05:43.283 --> 00:05:45.394
David Boder: All right. Nu, tell me...

00:05:45.394 --> 00:05:47.459
Adam Krakowski: I was then seventeen years old.

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:51.530
David Boder: What? You were then seventeen years old. So, go on. Nu?

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.163
Adam Krakowski: There I was two years, in that lager.

00:05:55.163 --> 00:05:55.796
David Boder: Hm.

00:05:55.796 --> 00:06:01.585
Adam Krakowski: Then there was a deportation from the town, and all the people were deported to an extermination lager.

00:06:01.585 --> 00:06:08.791
David Boder: Nu, tell us a little more about the two years in the lager. How did people live there and what did they do there?

00:06:08.791 --> 00:06:10.239
Adam Krakowski: There is not much to tell.

00:06:10.239 --> 00:06:12.184
David Boder: Oh, tell me all that you are able.

00:06:12.184 --> 00:06:14.129
Adam Krakowski: Work and again work.

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:15.772
David Boder: Yes. What did you do?

00:06:15.772 --> 00:06:17.672
Adam Krakowski: Road building at that time.

00:06:17.672 --> 00:06:18.441
David Boder: Road building?

00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:19.150
Adam Krakowski: Road building.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.240
David Boder: Why were they building roads?

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:29.929
Adam Krakowski: They needed it. That was a large hydroelectric plant.

00:06:29.929 --> 00:06:30.517
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:30.517 --> 00:06:31.135
Adam Krakowski: In Rozno.

00:06:31.135 --> 00:06:31.587
David Boder: Yes?

00:06:31.587 --> 00:06:34.241
Adam Krakowski: We were building there a side [extra?] road.

00:06:34.241 --> 00:06:36.879
David Boder: Hm. That was where, in Rozno?

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:37.543
Adam Krakowski: Rozno.

00:06:37.543 --> 00:06:40.061
David Boder: Rozno. Which district? Was it in Poland?

00:06:40.061 --> 00:06:41.855
Adam Krakowski: Lozandor [?]. It is not far from Cracow.

00:06:41.855 --> 00:06:49.709
David Boder: Not far from Cracow. Tell me about it. Now how did you live in the lager? Where did you live? Where did you sleep?

00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:55.770
Adam Krakowski: We slept in barracks. There were not even windows in these barracks, only a door...

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:56.780
David Boder: Yes?

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.438
Adam Krakowski: . . . and a whole row of beds.

00:06:58.438 --> 00:07:01.695
David Boder: Hm, and who had built these barracks?

00:07:01.695 --> 00:07:04.635
Adam Krakowski: Also the same people, the Jews.

00:07:04.635 --> 00:07:09.625
David Boder: And so, tell me, a row of beds? What sort of beds were there?

00:07:09.625 --> 00:07:12.474
Adam Krakowski: Wooden beds, and on top straw.

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:14.012
David Boder: A bed for every person?

00:07:14.012 --> 00:07:17.012
Adam Krakowski: No. One whole row for twenty, thirty persons.

00:07:17.012 --> 00:07:20.389
David Boder: And so, there were no beds then. There was a...

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:21.309
Adam Krakowski: Plankbeds.

00:07:21.309 --> 00:07:25.967
David Boder: Oh, plankbeds. And so, go on. All right. And how many people slept on such a plankbed?

00:07:25.967 --> 00:07:29.344
Adam Krakowski: Twenty, thirty people. It varied, small ones and larger ones.

00:07:29.344 --> 00:07:31.877
David Boder: And how near one to another did you sleep?

00:07:31.877 --> 00:07:35.148
Adam Krakowski: Oh, quite near. One meter perhaps.

00:07:35.148 --> 00:07:36.988
David Boder: One meter between the...

00:07:36.988 --> 00:07:39.355
Adam Krakowski: No. Every person had a meter in width.

00:07:39.355 --> 00:07:40.350
David Boder: One meter in width.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:40.923
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:07:40.923 --> 00:07:46.682
David Boder: Hm. And how did people keep apart? [Pause.] How did people feel...how did people...

00:07:46.682 --> 00:07:50.888
Adam Krakowski: It was very dirty there, and vermin, and...

00:07:50.888 --> 00:07:53.752
David Boder: Vermin.What kind of vermin?

00:07:53.752 --> 00:07:56.436
Adam Krakowski: Fleas. There were as yet no lice there.

00:07:56.436 --> 00:07:58.140
David Boder: How come?

00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.271
Adam Krakowski: Still...

00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:01.939
David Boder: Did you have a chance to wash?

00:08:01.939 --> 00:08:06.673
Adam Krakowski: Not much. There was one well for the entire lager, for about eight hundred people.

00:08:06.673 --> 00:08:08.301
David Boder: Were there bedbugs?

00:08:08.301 --> 00:08:09.779
Adam Krakowski: No, there were no bedbugs.

00:08:09.779 --> 00:08:10.910
David Boder: No. Than you had mostly fleas.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:11.528
Adam Krakowski: Fleas.

00:08:11.528 --> 00:08:18.011
David Boder: All right. Nu? And so you slept there, and in the morning when did you get up?

00:08:18.011 --> 00:08:22.307
Adam Krakowski: At four o’clock in the morning. When we got up there was an appell. It lasted two hours.

00:08:22.307 --> 00:08:24.358
David Boder: Was that called in German, too, Appell?

00:08:24.358 --> 00:00:00.000
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:08:24.886
David Boder: Yes.

00:08:24.886 --> 00:00:00.000
Adam Krakowski: Appell.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:08:27.072
David Boder: And?

00:08:27.072 --> 00:08:29.017
Adam Krakowski: And then, at seven, half past seven...

00:08:29.017 --> 00:08:33.163
David Boder: And so where was the Appell? What did you do immediately after the Appell?

00:08:33.163 --> 00:08:36.163
Adam Krakowski: Nu, they loaded us on trucks, and we went to work.

00:08:36.163 --> 00:08:38.870
David Boder: Not so fast. Wait a moment. Did you get dressed?

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:39.284
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:08:39.284 --> 00:08:40.158
David Boder: Did you wash?

00:08:40.158 --> 00:08:41.033
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:08:41.033 --> 00:08:43.219
David Boder: All right. Were you counted?

00:08:43.219 --> 00:08:46.189
Adam Krakowski: Yes, and then sent to work.

00:08:46.189 --> 00:08:47.651
David Boder: Did you get no breakfast?

00:08:47.651 --> 00:08:51.631
Adam Krakowski: No. We only got the bread in the evening, and that was [had to be] enough for breakfast too.

00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:55.973
David Boder: Hm. All right. Then you were...tell please...you were...

00:08:55.973 --> 00:08:57.707
Adam Krakowski: Driven to the construction job.

00:08:57.707 --> 00:08:58.174
David Boder: Hm.

00:08:58.174 --> 00:09:00.134
Adam Krakowski: Then we worked till twelve o’clock.

00:09:00.134 --> 00:09:00.496
David Boder: Yes.

00:09:00.496 --> 00:09:06.843
Adam Krakowski: At twelve o’clock was dinner, which they brought from the lager also on trucks. We ate the dinner on the construction.

00:09:06.843 --> 00:09:07.340
David Boder: Hm.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:08.607
Adam Krakowski: And then...

00:09:08.607 --> 00:09:09.074
David Boder: Continued working.

00:09:09.074 --> 00:09:11.456
Adam Krakowski: Continued working from twelve thirty until seven o’clock.

00:09:11.456 --> 00:09:16.582
David Boder: All right. Tell me this. They brought dinner. What did they give you?

00:09:16.582 --> 00:09:20.426
Adam Krakowski: Just one course, soup.

00:09:20.426 --> 00:09:23.984
David Boder: Did everyone have separate bowls?

00:09:23.984 --> 00:09:28.657
Adam Krakowski: Yes, everyone received a bowl, a spoon, and out of that he ate.

00:09:28.657 --> 00:09:32.969
David Boder: Out of that he ate. Nu, all right, and then you worked until...

00:09:32.969 --> 00:09:33.889
Adam Krakowski: Till seven o’clock.

00:09:33.889 --> 00:09:37.643
David Boder: Until seven, and between, from twelve till seven, did you get anything to eat?

00:09:37.643 --> 00:09:38.352
Adam Krakowski: No, nothing.

00:09:38.352 --> 00:09:40.538
David Boder: All right, nu, what did you do at seven o’clock?

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:43.900
Adam Krakowski: At seven o’clock, back to the lager, again at appell.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:44.247
David Boder: Yes.

00:09:44.247 --> 00:09:46.614
Adam Krakowski: Counted up, and received supper.

00:09:46.614 --> 00:09:48.348
David Boder: What were you given for supper?

00:09:48.348 --> 00:09:52.614
Adam Krakowski: Hm, bread, an eighth part of a loaf. One loaf for eight people.

00:09:52.614 --> 00:09:54.604
David Boder: And how much did the loaf weigh?

00:09:54.604 --> 00:09:56.685
Adam Krakowski: A kilo fifty, I believe.

00:09:56.685 --> 00:09:57.122
David Boder: Hm.

00:09:57.122 --> 00:09:58.147
Adam Krakowski: One thousand five hundred grams.

00:09:58.147 --> 00:10:03.273
David Boder: One thousand five hundred grams. So everyone received approximately two hundred grams of bread, and what else?

00:10:03.273 --> 00:10:06.725
Adam Krakowski: Nu, two, three times a week there was also a little piece of margarine.

00:10:06.725 --> 00:10:11.188
David Boder: Oh, and then what was done? Went to bed?

00:10:11.188 --> 00:10:12.258
Adam Krakowski: Went to bed.

00:10:12.258 --> 00:10:14.339
David Boder: Did you have anything to read?

00:10:14.339 --> 00:10:16.947
Adam Krakowski: Oh, of course not. That was impossible. There was no light in the barracks.

00:10:16.947 --> 00:10:17.339
David Boder: What?

00:10:17.339 --> 00:10:18.455
Adam Krakowski: There was no light in the barracks.

00:10:18.455 --> 00:10:24.138
David Boder: There was no light in the barracks. Did you have a chance to sit down and talk to one another?

00:10:24.138 --> 00:10:28.540
Adam Krakowski: No, just to lie down. The plankbeds were in two stories.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.772
David Boder: Oh, could you talk to one another?

00:10:30.772 --> 00:10:32.084
Adam Krakowski: Talk, yes.

00:10:32.084 --> 00:10:34.179
David Boder: Were you permitted to sing?

00:10:34.179 --> 00:10:37.948
Adam Krakowski: No, that they did not permit. Silence had to reign.

00:10:37.948 --> 00:10:41.687
David Boder: Silence had to reign. Did you have Sunday free?

00:10:41.687 --> 00:10:43.978
Adam Krakowski: Sunday we worked until dinner.

00:10:43.978 --> 00:10:45.486
David Boder: Sunday you worked until dinner.

00:10:45.486 --> 00:10:45.818
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:10:45.818 --> 00:10:48.094
David Boder: All right. What did you do after dinner?

00:10:48.094 --> 00:10:51.592
Adam Krakowski: Nu, it was free. Everyone would wash, wash the underwear.

00:10:51.592 --> 00:10:52.934
David Boder: Did you have soap?

00:10:52.934 --> 00:10:55.753
Adam Krakowski: No. This we got still from home yet.

00:10:55.753 --> 00:10:58.045
David Boder: What do you mean from home. Did they send it to you?

00:10:58.045 --> 00:10:58.934
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:10:58.934 --> 00:11:01.467
David Boder: Did they permit to send you?

00:11:01.467 --> 00:11:04.573
Adam Krakowski: It was not permitted, but still there were ways.

00:11:04.573 --> 00:11:07.241
David Boder: Did they pay you any money?

00:11:07.241 --> 00:11:08.297
Adam Krakowski: No, no money.

00:11:08.297 --> 00:11:13.920
David Boder: No money. Then what did people who wanted to smoke do?

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:20.794
Adam Krakowski: Those who received from home, those smoked. Those who got nothing, did not smoke.

00:11:20.794 --> 00:11:25.980
David Boder: Tell me, how did people receive mail there? Were the letters distributed every day?

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.061
Adam Krakowski: No. There was no mail service.

00:11:28.061 --> 00:11:28.468
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:28.468 --> 00:11:31.845
Adam Krakowski: We received no letters, and we were not permitted to write any letters.

00:11:31.845 --> 00:11:34.513
David Boder: Then how did people receive things from home?

00:11:34.513 --> 00:11:39.760
Adam Krakowski: Someone would be sent, a Pole most often, and he would bring it.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.820
David Boder: Where did one find such a Pole?

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.298
Adam Krakowski: In the town.

00:11:44.298 --> 00:11:46.303
David Boder: When did you go to town?

00:11:46.303 --> 00:11:50.434
Adam Krakowski: The parents, for instance, would find such a Pole. They would send him.

00:11:50.434 --> 00:11:54.339
David Boder: Hm. And then...did he have a chance to see you or what?

00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:55.922
Adam Krakowski: Yes, on the construction job.

00:11:55.922 --> 00:11:56.600
David Boder: Oh, on the construction job, on the street.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.595
Adam Krakowski: On the construction job.

00:11:57.595 --> 00:12:03.113
David Boder: On the street. There you could pick it up? Nu, how were the Germans to you, those who supervised you?

00:12:03.113 --> 00:12:04.545
Adam Krakowski: There were various.

00:12:04.545 --> 00:12:07.229
David Boder: Yes? Were there good ones?

00:12:07.229 --> 00:12:10.561
Adam Krakowski: There were, but not many.

00:12:10.561 --> 00:12:11.692
David Boder: There were decent people.

00:12:11.692 --> 00:12:12.612
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:12:12.612 --> 00:12:16.607
David Boder: Who supervised the construction, engineers, or who?

00:12:16.607 --> 00:12:19.215
Adam Krakowski: Yes, there were German engineers, too.

00:12:19.215 --> 00:12:20.873
David Boder: Were there any Jewish overseers?

00:12:20.873 --> 00:12:31.245
Adam Krakowski: No, there were no Jewish overseers. Only later there was Jewish self-government in the lager, but no overseers. Just the food distribution, the kitchen, was in Jewish hands.

00:12:31.245 --> 00:12:36.024
David Boder: That was the self-government. Nu, go on.

00:12:36.024 --> 00:12:48.507
Adam Krakowski: Nu, then occurred the depopulation [of Jews] of the town. That was in August, ’42. All the people were in a transport. A transport was assembled and all the people were sent to an extermination lager, and until now...

00:12:48.507 --> 00:12:51.447
David Boder: Were you told that they are being sent to an extermination lager?

00:12:51.447 --> 00:12:54.749
Adam Krakowski: No. Only later we found it out.

00:12:54.749 --> 00:12:55.126
David Boder: Yes?

00:12:55.126 --> 00:12:57.493
Adam Krakowski: From the Poles who told us that.

00:12:57.493 --> 00:13:00.644
David Boder: Hm. Where were they sent?

00:13:00.644 --> 00:13:02.287
Adam Krakowski: To Belzec.

00:13:02.287 --> 00:13:03.117
David Boder: To Belsen?

00:13:03.117 --> 00:13:04.097
Adam Krakowski: Belzec.

00:13:04.097 --> 00:13:06.494
David Boder: Belzec. Where is that?

00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:10.368
Adam Krakowski: It is, I believe around a hundred kilometers from Lublin, between Lublin and Lemberg.

00:13:10.368 --> 00:13:14.861
David Boder: Yes, now, in the lager where you were, where you were working, were there many women?

00:13:14.861 --> 00:13:15.781
Adam Krakowski: No.

00:13:15.781 --> 00:13:16.610
David Boder: Only men.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:17.304
Adam Krakowski: Only men.

00:13:17.304 --> 00:13:19.611
David Boder: All right. Then you came to Belzec.

00:13:19.611 --> 00:13:24.571
Adam Krakowski: No, not we. Just the transport from the town, and these people who were in lagers...

00:13:24.571 --> 00:13:25.249
David Boder: Yes?

00:13:25.249 --> 00:13:36.224
Adam Krakowski: . . . these remained. And we were there a few more days. Then we were sent to another lager, to a wood construction job.

00:13:36.224 --> 00:13:37.702
David Boder: What did you do there?

00:13:37.702 --> 00:13:40.913
Adam Krakowski: There barracks were built. We made parts for barracks...

00:13:40.913 --> 00:13:41.215
David Boder: Yes?

00:13:41.215 --> 00:13:42.104
Adam Krakowski: . . . out of wood.

00:13:42.104 --> 00:13:44.305
David Boder: Then you did not go to an extermination lager.

00:13:44.305 --> 00:13:46.537
Adam Krakowski: Not I, but the family went there. [Words not clear.]

00:13:46.537 --> 00:13:49.839
David Boder: Hm. Oh, then your family was...

00:13:49.839 --> 00:13:50.005
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:13:50.005 --> 00:13:52.131
David Boder: . . . taken and sent away to an extermination lager.

00:13:52.131 --> 00:13:53.292
Adam Krakowski: Extermination lager.

00:13:53.292 --> 00:13:55.568
David Boder: And where was this lager?

00:13:55.568 --> 00:13:56.292
Adam Krakowski: In Belzec.

00:13:56.292 --> 00:14:01.207
David Boder: In Belzec. And how did you know that they were sent to Belzec?

00:14:01.207 --> 00:14:02.247
Adam Krakowski: We only found that out later.

00:14:02.247 --> 00:14:03.122
David Boder: How?

00:14:03.122 --> 00:14:06.032
Adam Krakowski: The Poles told us that later...

00:14:06.032 --> 00:14:06.620
David Boder: Hm.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.625
Adam Krakowski: . . . where the transports went to.

00:14:08.625 --> 00:14:14.263
David Boder: Hm. Nu, tell me this...and you have heard nothing from them?

00:14:14.263 --> 00:14:27.801
Adam Krakowski: Nu, that was already all. Only later did people come to us, when I was already in another lager, and there were many people, too, who had been in the extermination lagers, in Treblinka. They already told exactly how things looked there.

00:14:27.801 --> 00:14:30.499
David Boder: Yes. How did they get away from Treblinka?

00:14:30.499 --> 00:14:38.128
Adam Krakowski: These people were in an outside detail, who had been sent from Treblinka to work.

00:14:38.128 --> 00:14:38.806
David Boder: Hm.

00:14:38.806 --> 00:14:40.465
Adam Krakowski: And they came to Budzina.

00:14:40.465 --> 00:14:41.143
David Boder: Yes?

00:14:41.143 --> 00:14:49.465
Adam Krakowski: Another lager, and from Budzina we went to Rzeszow [repeats in Polish] Rzeszow, and [words not clear] in the third lager.

00:14:49.465 --> 00:14:52.179
David Boder: Yes. Where was the third lager in which you were?

00:14:52.179 --> 00:14:56.023
Adam Krakowski: In Rzeszow. [Words not clear.]

00:14:56.023 --> 00:14:56.807
David Boder: Where is that?

00:14:56.807 --> 00:14:59.038
Adam Krakowski: Between Cracow and Lemberg.

00:14:59.038 --> 00:15:00.305
David Boder: Hm.

00:15:00.305 --> 00:15:02.913
Adam Krakowski: And there was a factory, an airplane engine factory.

00:15:02.913 --> 00:15:03.998
David Boder: Yes?

00:15:03.998 --> 00:15:05.958
Adam Krakowski: And there I was about two years.

00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.647
David Boder: What did you do there?

00:15:07.647 --> 00:15:12.878
Adam Krakowski: We worked there at the airplane engines. Mostly odd jobs.

00:15:12.878 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: Odd jobs. And where did you live? Where did you sleep?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:15:16.617
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:15:16.617 --> 00:15:20.552
Adam Krakowski: In the factory there was a small lager. We were there, three, four hundred people.

00:15:20.552 --> 00:15:21.381
David Boder: Yes?

00:15:21.381 --> 00:15:24.517
Adam Krakowski: And there the conditions were already somewhat better.

00:15:24.517 --> 00:15:25.346
David Boder: Yes?

00:15:25.346 --> 00:15:30.502
Adam Krakowski: We were only working twelve hours. Then we had free, and on Sunday it was free, too.

00:15:30.502 --> 00:15:36.125
David Boder: Tell me, there were so many men there. Did they ever see women or...

00:15:36.125 --> 00:15:37.512
Adam Krakowski: No, never.

00:15:37.512 --> 00:15:44.085
David Boder: And...eh...how did the men feel being away from women?

00:15:44.085 --> 00:00:00.000
Adam Krakowski: Very bad, but...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:15:47.025
David Boder: Eh...

00:15:47.025 --> 00:15:49.000
Adam Krakowski: . . . there was no way out.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:58.211
David Boder: Eh...did it ever happen that...all right. Nu, tell me this...and you were there two years?

00:15:58.211 --> 00:15:58.271
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:15:58.271 --> 00:15:59.990
David Boder: In what years was that?

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:02.176
Adam Krakowski: From ’42 to ’44.

00:16:02.176 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: To ’44.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:16:03.307
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:16:03.307 --> 00:16:04.558
David Boder: Summer or winter of ’44?

00:16:04.558 --> 00:16:05.252
Adam Krakowski: Summer.

00:16:05.252 --> 00:16:05.418
David Boder: Go on.

00:16:05.418 --> 00:16:10.890
Adam Krakowski: Then the Russians advanced, so we were evacuated. We had been already quite near the front lines.

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:11.162
David Boder: Yes?

00:16:11.162 --> 00:16:13.710
Adam Krakowski: The front was about four, five miles away from us.

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:14.388
David Boder: Yes?

00:16:14.388 --> 00:16:18.519
Adam Krakowski: So we were sent to lager
                        Plaszow, near Cracow.

00:16:18.519 --> 00:16:18.941
David Boder: Yes.

00:16:18.941 --> 00:16:22.921
Adam Krakowski: There we were twenty-one or-three thousand Jews.

00:16:22.921 --> 00:16:23.434
David Boder: Hm.

00:16:23.434 --> 00:16:25.047
Adam Krakowski: There were already women, too.

00:16:25.047 --> 00:16:25.952
David Boder: Yes?

00:16:25.952 --> 00:16:39.173
Adam Krakowski: There we were only a few days. Then we were sent to another lager, Wieliczka, also thirty kilometers from Cracow. Again a few days and [to] Flossenberg in Germany. This was the first lager in Germany.

00:16:39.173 --> 00:16:41.525
David Boder: Yes, and from there?

00:16:41.525 --> 00:16:46.455
Adam Krakowski: There I was again three weeks. The I went to a lager in France, Colmar.

00:16:46.455 --> 00:16:48.128
David Boder: Oh, they had sent you to France.

00:16:48.128 --> 00:16:54.520
Adam Krakowski: Yes. And then again to another lager in France [word not clear]. We were working in a tunnel, again at airplace motors.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:55.063
David Boder: Hm.

00:16:55.063 --> 00:16:58.259
Adam Krakowski: In a tunnel, underground, four kilometers long.

00:16:58.259 --> 00:16:58.922
David Boder: Yes?

00:16:58.922 --> 00:17:07.003
Adam Krakowski: There we were two months, until the Americans approached. We were again evacuated. We were sent to Sachsenhausen.

00:17:07.003 --> 00:17:08.495
David Boder: Hm.

00:17:08.495 --> 00:17:15.249
Adam Krakowski: There we were three weeks and [then sent] to Branschweig to a bomb and grenade factory.

00:17:15.249 --> 00:17:15.581
David Boder: Yes?

00:17:15.581 --> 00:17:17.134
Adam Krakowski: Those were the Hermann Goering Works.

00:17:17.134 --> 00:17:17.873
David Boder: Yes?

00:17:17.873 --> 00:17:35.180
Adam Krakowski: Steel works, Braunschweig. There I was half a year, until April, ’44. When the Americans began approaching again, we were evacuated to Ravensbrueck. For fourteen days we sat in railroad cars. We were a hundred, a hundred and twenty people to a railroad car.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.522
David Boder: Hm.

00:17:36.522 --> 00:17:44.768
Adam Krakowski: And then in Ravensbrueck again two weeks. There came a representative from Sweden and told us that all Jews are going to Sweden.

00:17:44.768 --> 00:17:45.070
David Boder: Yes?

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:49.246
Adam Krakowski: On a train they...

00:17:49.246 --> 00:17:49.834
David Boder: Put?

00:17:49.834 --> 00:18:09.236
Adam Krakowski: . . . put us and we traveled for four or five days. On the fifth day we were brought again to another lager, to a region near Ludwigslust. And we could not go any more to Sweden. And after two weeks the Americans came and...

00:18:09.236 --> 00:18:09.855
David Boder: Liberated.

00:18:09.855 --> 00:18:11.076
Adam Krakowski: . . . liberated us.

00:18:11.076 --> 00:18:22.232
David Boder: Tell me, when so many people were sent to extermination camps, how do you explain that you and other people were driven around and dragged around so much?

00:18:22.232 --> 00:18:25.895
Adam Krakowski: We happened to be able to work for them. They still needed us.

00:18:25.895 --> 00:18:36.267
David Boder: They needed you. Hm. Tell me this, you say that you talked with people who had been in extermination lagers.

00:18:36.267 --> 00:18:36.930
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:40.458
David Boder: What do these people tell about it?

00:18:40.458 --> 00:18:43.714
Adam Krakowski: The lagers were in the woods, Treblinka for example.

00:18:43.714 --> 00:18:51.230
David Boder: Yes?

00:18:51.230 --> 00:19:05.914
Adam Krakowski: When the transports would arrive, all would be made to get off and were first of all taken to a bath house. Everyone had to undress, and then his...his clothing he had to put aside, and he would receive a piece of soap, a towel and he would enter a large hall.

00:19:05.914 --> 00:19:06.894
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:06.894 --> 00:19:09.381
Adam Krakowski: And there they would open the gas...

00:19:09.381 --> 00:19:09.894
David Boder: Hm.

00:19:09.894 --> 00:19:17.793
Adam Krakowski: . . . in that hall, and when the people were all dead they were transported to the crematory, and there they were all burned.

00:19:17.793 --> 00:19:18.577
David Boder: Hm.

00:19:18.577 --> 00:19:30.155
Adam Krakowski: I believe a thousand people could get into such a hall, and such a hall could dispatch [liquidate] up to forty thousand people daily.

00:19:30.155 --> 00:19:42.014
David Boder: Hm. Tell me this, you were working in a labor detail. If anyone was sick, was there a doctor?

00:19:42.014 --> 00:19:45.482
Adam Krakowski: Sometimes one was allowed to be sick for only one week.

00:19:45.482 --> 00:19:46.130
David Boder: And when...

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:50.381
Adam Krakowski: And when one, for instance, was already sick for eight days, they shot him.

00:19:50.381 --> 00:19:50.683
David Boder: And...

00:19:50.683 --> 00:19:52.974
Adam Krakowski: The Gestapo was called and he was immediately shot.

00:19:52.974 --> 00:19:54.331
David Boder: You mean, there in the lager?

00:19:54.331 --> 00:19:55.567
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:19:55.567 --> 00:19:57.708
David Boder: Did the others...

00:19:57.708 --> 00:19:58.070
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.809
David Boder: . . . know that it is done so?

00:19:58.809 --> 00:19:59.518
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:19:59.518 --> 00:20:00.498
David Boder: What, did they say so?

00:20:00.498 --> 00:20:05.609
Adam Krakowski: Yes, they said so. Seven days one may be sick, but not any longer.

00:20:05.609 --> 00:20:08.217
David Boder: Nu, if one would have typhus?

00:20:08.217 --> 00:20:12.740
Adam Krakowski: Then he was immediately shot. This was until the year ’43.

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:13.237
David Boder: Until ’43.

00:20:13.237 --> 00:20:15.438
Adam Krakowski: Until ’43. After that, not any more.

00:20:15.438 --> 00:20:16.011
David Boder: What happened then?

00:20:16.011 --> 00:20:22.222
Adam Krakowski: The we had already what was called a revier [sick-ward]. Such a hospital. A provisional hospital in the lager.

00:20:22.222 --> 00:20:22.433
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:22.433 --> 00:20:26.745
Adam Krakowski: That was a barrack, and there the sick would be kept.

00:20:26.745 --> 00:20:28.011
David Boder: By the Germans.

00:20:28.011 --> 00:20:28.584
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:20:28.584 --> 00:20:29.067
David Boder: Hm.

00:20:29.067 --> 00:20:31.645
Adam Krakowski: There were Germans, too, prisoners. Separately.

00:20:31.645 --> 00:20:35.278
David Boder: German prisoners. Were there Jewish physicians?

00:20:35.278 --> 00:20:36.876
Adam Krakowski: There were Jews, yes.

00:20:36.876 --> 00:20:38.504
David Boder: And others?

00:20:38.504 --> 00:20:39.258
Adam Krakowski: Others, too.

00:20:39.258 --> 00:20:46.826
David Boder: Hm. And how did you get to France?

00:20:46.826 --> 00:20:47.836
Adam Krakowski: Now?

00:20:47.836 --> 00:20:50.158
David Boder: Yes, and so, the Americans liberated you.

00:20:50.158 --> 00:20:50.264
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:20:50.264 --> 00:20:51.726
David Boder: In which lager?

00:20:51.726 --> 00:20:54.952
Adam Krakowski: In [word not clear], near Ludwigslust. In Mecklenburg.

00:20:54.952 --> 00:21:09.063
David Boder: Yes? And what did you do then? Tell me what happened among the civilian Germans between the departure of the Germans and the arrival of the Americans? Did the Germans feel that they have already lost? How was it?

00:21:09.063 --> 00:21:11.671
Adam Krakowski: It was on the first of May, ’45.

00:21:11.671 --> 00:21:11.912
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:11.912 --> 00:21:19.601
Adam Krakowski: They loaded us again on RR-cars. They said that the Americans are approaching and we have to be evacuated again.

00:21:19.601 --> 00:21:19.978
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:19.978 --> 00:21:29.838
Adam Krakowski: And there we sat twenty-four hours in the RR-cars. Then we were told to get off again. There is no road [tracks] any more, they said. We must go on foot.

00:21:29.838 --> 00:21:31.300
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:37.602
Adam Krakowski: And when we returned again to the lager, all the SS had disappeared.

00:21:37.602 --> 00:21:38.311
David Boder: Hm.

00:21:38.311 --> 00:21:52.135
Adam Krakowski: It lasted about fifteen minutes. Then we noticed it, that they escaped to the woods, so we took the weapons and wanted to take them over.

00:21:52.135 --> 00:21:53.341
David Boder: Yes?

00:21:53.341 --> 00:22:03.487
Adam Krakowski: And from the time that the SS had run away and the Americans arrived it took about half an hour. And there were already the American parachute troops.

00:22:03.487 --> 00:22:04.648
David Boder: The parachute troops?

00:22:04.648 --> 00:22:05.839
Adam Krakowski: The parachute troops, yes.

00:22:05.839 --> 00:22:08.146
David Boder: Nu?

00:22:08.146 --> 00:22:13.498
Adam Krakowski: And they immediately...immediately appeared in the lager. In a short time we saw already other patrols.

00:22:13.498 --> 00:22:13.965
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:13.965 --> 00:22:15.503
Adam Krakowski: On automobiles [motorized].

00:22:15.503 --> 00:22:20.779
David Boder: And when was the first time you received American food?

00:22:20.779 --> 00:22:30.850
Adam Krakowski: Oh, American food we received later. Only two, three weeks later. In the meantime we organized [appropriated, stole] as it was called. We went to the village and fetched from there.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:33.518
David Boder: What do you mean, you fetched. You took it away from the people?

00:22:33.518 --> 00:22:41.116
Adam Krakowski: No. We told the German people there that we are from the lager, we are hungry, they should give us voluntarily, and they gave us.

00:22:41.116 --> 00:22:45.971
David Boder: Hm. And were there only Jews in that lager?

00:22:45.971 --> 00:22:52.107
Adam Krakowski: No, there were four thousand people. There were perhaps eight, nine hundred Jews and the rest were other nations.

00:22:52.107 --> 00:22:52.755
David Boder: For instance?

00:22:52.755 --> 00:22:58.303
Adam Krakowski: There were Frenchmen, there were Italians, Russians, Poles, Czechs, Rumanians, Danes from Denmark.

00:22:58.303 --> 00:23:07.695
David Boder: How come there were also people from Denmark? Tell me, were there German Jews too?

00:23:07.695 --> 00:23:09.971
Adam Krakowski: There were, too, but not many.

00:23:09.971 --> 00:23:13.770
David Boder: And did the German Jews and the Polish Jews get along well?

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:14.796
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:23:14.796 --> 00:23:15.444
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:15.444 --> 00:23:16.952
Adam Krakowski: There was already solidarity.

00:23:16.952 --> 00:23:17.238
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:17.238 --> 00:23:18.656
Adam Krakowski: We had to get along well together.

00:23:18.656 --> 00:23:33.174
David Boder: Hm. So then.../pause] so only two, three weeks after the Americans had arrived, did the Americans begin to...

00:23:33.174 --> 00:23:34.124
Adam Krakowski: Yes, to feed.

00:23:34.124 --> 00:23:38.481
David Boder: Did the individual soldiers, the Americans, help you in any way?

00:23:38.481 --> 00:23:40.215
Adam Krakowski: Oh, yes, quite often.

00:23:40.215 --> 00:23:40.682
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:40.682 --> 00:23:42.522
Adam Krakowski: They would give chocolate, cigarettes, quite often.

00:23:42.522 --> 00:23:45.009
David Boder: But, otherwise, you had to go to the village?

00:23:45.009 --> 00:23:49.261
Adam Krakowski: Yes. There were then also many Jews among the Americans, and they helped us, too.

00:23:49.261 --> 00:23:55.758
David Boder: Hm. How can a small village, or a small town, feed four thousand people every day?

00:23:55.758 --> 00:24:04.020
Adam Krakowski: Nu, they were not...the whole four thousand people were not able to go. The majority stayed in the lager. They could not walk anymore.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:04.789
David Boder: Why not?

00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:06.040
Adam Krakowski: They were weak, sick.

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.367
David Boder: Hm.

00:24:07.367 --> 00:24:10.789
Adam Krakowski: So there was only about a thousand people who were able to go [walk].

00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:15.282
David Boder: And who cared for the sick?

00:24:15.282 --> 00:24:16.805
Adam Krakowski: Other comrades.

00:24:16.805 --> 00:24:22.308
David Boder: Hm. Did the Americans at least bring medicine right away?

00:24:22.308 --> 00:24:30.494
Adam Krakowski: No, only later. After one week, two weeks, were all the sick taken to hospitals.

00:24:30.494 --> 00:24:32.680
David Boder: So it was not that the moment they entered.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:33.811
Adam Krakowski: No, no.

00:24:33.811 --> 00:24:34.278
David Boder: What?

00:24:34.278 --> 00:24:38.590
Adam Krakowski: Many people died already after the liberation, too.

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:43.821
David Boder: Hm. In what lager was that?

00:24:43.821 --> 00:24:46.113
Adam Krakowski: Ludwigslust. Right near Ludwigslust.

00:24:46.113 --> 00:24:53.847
David Boder: Ludwigslust, and who brought you over to France?

00:24:53.847 --> 00:25:00.616
Adam Krakowski: Nu, after that I was a few months in Poland, and then I received the news that the brother in France is alive.

00:25:00.616 --> 00:25:01.234
David Boder: Yes?

00:25:01.234 --> 00:25:03.314
Adam Krakowski: So I left Poland.

00:25:03.314 --> 00:25:05.395
David Boder: How did you leave? Did they let you leave?

00:25:05.395 --> 00:25:08.877
Adam Krakowski: No. I smuggled myself across the border.

00:25:08.877 --> 00:25:11.289
David Boder: Which border?

00:25:11.289 --> 00:25:12.827
Adam Krakowski: Between Stettin and Berlin.

00:25:12.827 --> 00:25:15.872
David Boder: Yes. So then you entered Russian Poland.

00:25:15.872 --> 00:25:16.385
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:25:16.385 --> 00:25:18.300
David Boder: Were you not stopped there?

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.843
Adam Krakowski: No, from there I went on to the American zone in Berlin.

00:25:21.843 --> 00:25:22.129
David Boder: Yes?

00:25:22.129 --> 00:25:24.511
Adam Krakowski: And from there was a transport of the UNRRA.

00:25:24.511 --> 00:25:25.506
David Boder: Yes?

00:25:25.506 --> 00:25:27.074
Adam Krakowski: By automobiles...

00:25:27.074 --> 00:25:27.285
David Boder: Hm.

00:25:27.285 --> 00:25:29.456
Adam Krakowski: . . . to Hannover, and then to Frankfurt.

00:25:29.456 --> 00:25:32.471
David Boder: Hm, and the UNRRA took the people?

00:25:32.471 --> 00:00:00.000
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: Whoever could go.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:25:34.491
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:25:34.491 --> 00:25:44.109
David Boder: How did you get into...tell me, you were in Poland...Wait. The Americans liberated you where?

00:25:44.109 --> 00:25:45.466
Adam Krakowski: In Germany.

00:25:45.466 --> 00:25:47.032
David Boder: And why did you go back to Poland?

00:25:47.032 --> 00:25:50.767
Adam Krakowski: Well, I though perhaps someone may still be alive, perhaps some distant relations.

00:25:50.767 --> 00:25:52.966
David Boder: Hm. Did you find anyone alive?

00:25:52.966 --> 00:25:53.900
Adam Krakowski: No, there was no one.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.105
David Boder: Did you return to Lodz?

00:25:55.105 --> 00:25:55.870
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:57.527
David Boder: How did Lodz look then?

00:25:57.527 --> 00:26:00.581
Adam Krakowski: Well, just as before the war. It was not destroyed.

00:26:00.581 --> 00:26:13.925
David Boder: Tell me, there was in Lodz a factory of...Sigman...a large fact...Sigman, an American textile factory.

00:26:13.925 --> 00:26:14.841
Adam Krakowski: Oh, yes.

00:26:14.841 --> 00:26:15.576
David Boder: Yes.

00:26:15.576 --> 00:26:17.154
Adam Krakowski: It is now nationalized.

00:26:17.154 --> 00:26:17.847
David Boder: It is now nationalized.

00:26:17.847 --> 00:26:18.419
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:26:18.419 --> 00:26:21.281
David Boder: But what did the Germans do with the factory?

00:26:21.281 --> 00:26:23.251
Adam Krakowski: Nothing, it went on producing.

00:26:23.251 --> 00:26:24.137
David Boder: Yes?

00:26:24.137 --> 00:26:25.143
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:26:25.143 --> 00:26:25.806
David Boder: For the Germans.

00:26:25.806 --> 00:26:26.330
Adam Krakowski: For the Germans.

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:27.354
David Boder: You know the factory? A large...

00:26:27.354 --> 00:26:27.686
Adam Krakowski: Yes, yes.

00:26:27.686 --> 00:26:30.740
David Boder: . . . American factory. What does it do now?

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:32.276
Adam Krakowski: It goes on working now.

00:26:32.276 --> 00:26:34.505
David Boder: What do they produce?

00:26:34.505 --> 00:26:37.487
Adam Krakowski: That I do not know exactly.

00:26:37.487 --> 00:26:38.541
David Boder: Textile goods, or...

00:26:38.541 --> 00:26:39.505
Adam Krakowski: I don’t know exactly.

00:26:39.505 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: You don’t know exactly. So then you went voluntarily back to Poland?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:26:41.072
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:26:41.072 --> 00:26:46.879
David Boder: To Lodz, because you wanted to know what...

00:26:46.879 --> 00:26:49.680
Adam Krakowski: If anyone of the family is still alive, of the distant relations.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.367
David Boder: Yes, nu, and no one was alive.

00:26:51.367 --> 00:26:52.150
Adam Krakowski: No one was there.

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:54.711
David Boder: What did the people tell you?

00:26:54.711 --> 00:27:07.404
Adam Krakowski: They told they were in the ghetto, some of the family, and were from the ghetto sent to Auschwitz. I waited another month. I thought perhaps someone will still come back, but no one came back any more.

00:27:07.404 --> 00:27:08.681
David Boder: Oh, you waited still.

00:27:08.681 --> 00:27:09.043
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:27:09.043 --> 00:27:12.127
David Boder: All right, then, from Lodz where did you go?

00:27:12.127 --> 00:27:15.139
Adam Krakowski: I received the news from Paris that the brother there is alive.

00:27:15.139 --> 00:27:17.037
David Boder: How did one get the news?

00:27:17.037 --> 00:27:20.212
Adam Krakowski: Through the mail already. He wrote to the old address.

00:27:20.212 --> 00:27:21.760
David Boder: And the mail went through?

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.567
Adam Krakowski: Yes, it took five months.

00:27:23.567 --> 00:27:25.164
David Boder: Yes? And?

00:27:25.164 --> 00:27:31.772
Adam Krakowski: Then I got [drove] out or Lodz. After six weeks I arrived in Paris.

00:27:31.772 --> 00:27:34.393
David Boder: How did you get [drive] out? What did you take? A train?

00:27:34.393 --> 00:27:36.212
Adam Krakowski: No, on foot.

00:27:36.212 --> 00:27:37.809
David Boder: You drove out on foot?

00:27:37.809 --> 00:27:41.887
Adam Krakowski: Sure. [Words not clear.] [Both laugh at the wording.]

00:27:41.887 --> 00:27:47.219
David Boder: And over the border? Was the border not guarded, or what?

00:27:47.219 --> 00:27:49.641
Adam Krakowski: Yes, it was guarded, but still...

00:27:49.641 --> 00:27:51.671
David Boder: Who guarded the border, the Poles or...

00:27:51.671 --> 00:27:52.755
Adam Krakowski: The Poles and Russians.

00:27:52.755 --> 00:27:55.376
David Boder: Poles and Russians. So you got across?

00:27:55.376 --> 00:27:55.852
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:27:55.852 --> 00:27:58.111
David Boder: Where did you eat? What did you get to eat?

00:27:58.111 --> 00:28:03.533
Adam Krakowski: I took something along from Poland yet, and in Berlin I already received [help] from the Jewish committee.

00:28:03.533 --> 00:28:07.672
David Boder: You went in, directly to the American zone?

00:28:07.672 --> 00:28:08.377
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:28:08.377 --> 00:28:09.684
David Boder: And there was a Jewish committee?

00:28:09.684 --> 00:28:10.166
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:28:10.166 --> 00:28:11.672
David Boder: Who were they, Americans or Germans?

00:28:11.672 --> 00:28:14.534
Adam Krakowski: No. Jewish...Jews, Jewish Americans.

00:28:14.534 --> 00:28:18.793
David Boder: Hm. And they took you from there to where?

00:28:18.793 --> 00:28:21.504
Adam Krakowski: They sent me over to Hannover in the English zone.

00:28:21.504 --> 00:28:23.624
David Boder: The English zone. All right, and from there?

00:28:23.624 --> 00:28:27.299
Adam Krakowski: And from there again to the American zone, Frankfurt, Munich.

00:28:27.299 --> 00:28:29.438
David Boder: Yes, and then?

00:28:29.438 --> 00:28:34.902
Adam Krakowski: And then I went on already by myself. By train to Saarbruecken [sp?] and from Saarbruecken...

00:28:34.902 --> 00:28:36.782
David Boder: With what did you buy a ticket?

00:28:36.782 --> 00:28:39.113
Adam Krakowski: I still had some money on me.

00:28:39.113 --> 00:28:39.866
David Boder: From where?

00:28:39.866 --> 00:28:42.005
Adam Krakowski: From Poland. I had been working.

00:28:42.005 --> 00:28:43.915
David Boder: When did you work in Poland. After you returned?

00:28:43.915 --> 00:28:45.644
Adam Krakowski: After the liberation. The few months after liberation.

00:28:45.644 --> 00:28:47.042
David Boder: What did you work at?

00:28:47.042 --> 00:28:48.922
Adam Krakowski: I made maps [sketched?].

00:28:48.922 --> 00:28:50.109
David Boder: Are you a draftsman?

00:28:50.109 --> 00:28:51.416
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:28:51.416 --> 00:28:53.193
David Boder: What were you paid for it?

00:28:53.193 --> 00:28:56.868
Adam Krakowski: I made a few hundred Zlotys a day.

00:28:56.868 --> 00:29:00.513
David Boder: And what...what did the food cost? Or did [you get] the food...

00:29:00.513 --> 00:29:04.471
Adam Krakowski: It was about enough to live on without too much luxury.

00:29:04.471 --> 00:29:08.790
David Boder: Yes. [Chuckle.] And then you bought your ticket...

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:09.152
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:29:09.152 --> 00:29:10.128
David Boder: . . . and you came to Paris.

00:29:10.128 --> 00:29:14.146
Adam Krakowski: To Saarbruecken and from there again across the border again on foot.

00:29:14.146 --> 00:29:18.634
David Boder: Yes? Did you smuggle yourself across the border?

00:29:18.634 --> 00:29:19.236
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:29:19.236 --> 00:29:19.959
David Boder: Why?

00:29:19.959 --> 00:29:22.761
Adam Krakowski: I was not able to get a visa.

00:29:22.761 --> 00:29:25.725
David Boder: But your uncle [brother] was here.

00:29:25.725 --> 00:29:34.623
Adam Krakowski: It was impossible. I had to take too much time. I was in the French consulate in Baden-Baden. He told me it had to take half a year, maybe longer.

00:29:34.623 --> 00:29:35.418
David Boder: The French consul.

00:29:35.418 --> 00:29:36.834
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:29:36.834 --> 00:29:37.900
David Boder: Nu?

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:39.617
Adam Krakowski: [Words not clear.]

00:29:39.617 --> 00:29:41.015
David Boder: So you crossed the border.

00:29:41.015 --> 00:29:41.780
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:47.654
David Boder: And then...could you live here in Paris if you crossed the border?

00:29:47.654 --> 00:29:48.268
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:29:48.268 --> 00:29:50.829
David Boder: Yes, and with whom are you staying here in Paris?

00:29:50.829 --> 00:29:52.739
Adam Krakowski: I am staying with my brother.

00:29:52.739 --> 00:29:53.986
David Boder: Oh, you are staying with your brother.

00:29:53.986 --> 00:29:54.691
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:29:54.691 --> 00:29:56.480
David Boder: And in what business is your brother?

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.438
Adam Krakowski: He is a doctor of medicine.

00:29:58.438 --> 00:29:59.986
David Boder: Oh, he is a physician.

00:29:59.986 --> 00:30:01.703
Adam Krakowski: Physician.

00:30:01.703 --> 00:30:03.571
David Boder: What...has he always lived here in France?

00:30:03.571 --> 00:30:07.951
Adam Krakowski: Yes, he studied here. He finished his studies here and was here already.

00:30:07.951 --> 00:30:10.343
David Boder: Hm, and what do you now?

00:30:10.343 --> 00:30:14.482
Adam Krakowski: Now I am learning TSF [radio] and go on with painting.

00:30:14.482 --> 00:30:17.476
David Boder: And what are your plans for the future?

00:30:17.476 --> 00:30:20.139
Adam Krakowski: Hm...to go working at TSF.

00:30:20.139 --> 00:30:20.753
David Boder: What?

00:30:20.753 --> 00:30:22.139
Adam Krakowski: TSF. Radio.

00:30:22.139 --> 00:30:22.410
David Boder: And...

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:26.296
Adam Krakowski: They call it in French: telegraphie sans fil.

00:30:26.296 --> 00:30:30.916
David Boder: Hm. TSF. You want...what do you want to do in radio?

00:30:30.916 --> 00:30:33.808
Adam Krakowski: To become a radio mechanic. Set assembling.

00:30:33.808 --> 00:30:34.983
David Boder: Set assembling and so forth.

00:30:34.983 --> 00:30:35.808
Adam Krakowski: Installations.

00:30:35.808 --> 00:30:38.399
David Boder: Do you want to open up a store later on, or what?

00:30:38.399 --> 00:30:51.152
Adam Krakowski: Perhaps. At first I must learn the job, and then when I stand on my own feet and when it is possible, then I would like very much...[pause]

00:30:51.152 --> 00:30:52.688
David Boder: What?

00:30:52.688 --> 00:30:53.803
Adam Krakowski: . . . to work for myself.

00:30:53.803 --> 00:30:55.773
David Boder: Hm. Do you want to remain in France?

00:30:55.773 --> 00:31:00.303
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:31:00.303 --> 00:31:55.147
David Boder: Hm. Yes. Well, this is more or less a clear story. There are some particulars which...which we did not know too well. I wonder if you would do me a small favor. [Here follows one of the few attempts to administer a modified Thematic Apperception Test which was soon given up as greatly time consuming and falling outside the scope of the project.] Tell me, what does this picture remind you of? What would you think of this picture? What memories does it evoke in you? [Pause.] Were you to compose a story from this picture, what would you say it was?

00:31:55.147 --> 00:31:56.503
Adam Krakowski: A child...

00:31:56.503 --> 00:31:57.178
David Boder: Yes?

00:31:57.178 --> 00:32:01.407
Adam Krakowski: . . . perhaps an artist, playing the violin...

00:32:01.407 --> 00:32:03.859
David Boder: Yes?

00:32:03.859 --> 00:32:07.275
Adam Krakowski: Looks quite young.

00:32:07.275 --> 00:32:14.516
David Boder: And what is this picture?

00:32:14.516 --> 00:32:19.016
Adam Krakowski: A woman. Looks suffering.

00:32:19.016 --> 00:32:30.341
David Boder: Judging by your experience of the last five years, what would you say has happened to this woman?

00:32:30.341 --> 00:32:38.624
Adam Krakowski: Went through a lot. Has suffered much. That is seen in her face.

00:32:38.624 --> 00:32:48.621
David Boder: And what kind of a story does this picture represent?

00:32:48.621 --> 00:32:51.374
Adam Krakowski: A corpse, a mussulman.

00:32:51.374 --> 00:32:51.856
David Boder: What?

00:32:51.856 --> 00:32:55.814
Adam Krakowski: A mussulman, a sick one.

00:32:55.814 --> 00:32:56.609
David Boder: A sick one?

00:32:56.609 --> 00:32:56.700
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:57.857
David Boder: What is a mussulman?

00:32:57.857 --> 00:33:03.863
Adam Krakowski: A mussulman is a man who is already so weak that he cannot walk by himself.

00:33:03.863 --> 00:33:05.008
David Boder: Where does this word come from?

00:33:05.008 --> 00:33:07.671
Adam Krakowski: Ther Germans originated that word yet.

00:33:07.671 --> 00:33:09.008
David Boder: What is the word?

00:33:09.008 --> 00:33:09.912
Adam Krakowski: Mussulman.

00:33:09.912 --> 00:33:12.123
David Boder: How do you spell is? M-U-S...

00:33:12.123 --> 00:33:15.207
Adam Krakowski: . . . S-U-L-M-A-N.

00:33:15.207 --> 00:33:16.804
David Boder: And that means what?

00:33:16.804 --> 00:33:20.461
Adam Krakowski: That means weak people who cannot walk anymore. Sick people.

00:33:20.461 --> 00:33:30.865
David Boder: Hm, and what is this?

00:33:30.865 --> 00:33:35.305
Adam Krakowski: Freedom.

00:33:35.305 --> 00:33:41.100
David Boder: Hm, and what is this?

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:42.968
Adam Krakowski: Work.

00:33:42.968 --> 00:33:45.058
David Boder: Tell me more.

00:33:45.058 --> 00:33:47.890
Adam Krakowski: This is our future.

00:33:47.890 --> 00:34:00.432
David Boder: Hm. Now, what do you think of the future? Do you think we shall have war again?

00:34:00.432 --> 00:34:02.480
Adam Krakowski: I shall not go to a lager again.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.017
David Boder: What?

00:34:04.017 --> 00:34:05.625
Adam Krakowski: I shall not go to a lager again.

00:34:05.625 --> 00:34:07.131
David Boder: What would you do?

00:34:07.131 --> 00:34:09.481
Adam Krakowski: Anything, but not that.

00:34:09.481 --> 00:34:13.951
David Boder: Yes, but it does not...it did not depend on you whether to go to a lager.

00:34:13.951 --> 00:34:15.831
Adam Krakowski: Now it shall already depend on me.

00:34:15.831 --> 00:34:17.771
David Boder: What will you do then?

00:34:17.771 --> 00:34:20.434
Adam Krakowski: Anything, but not to go to a lager again.

00:34:20.434 --> 00:34:22.946
David Boder: For instance.

00:34:22.946 --> 00:34:25.235
Adam Krakowski: Become a soldier.

00:34:25.235 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: Hm.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:34:28.910
Adam Krakowski: Fight.

00:34:28.910 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: All right.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:34:29.826
Adam Krakowski: [Words not clear.]

00:34:29.826 --> 00:34:39.657
David Boder: Was it then possible for you to become a soldier? How old were you when it started?

00:34:39.657 --> 00:34:41.766
Adam Krakowski: Fifteen.

00:34:41.766 --> 00:34:43.706
David Boder: Fifteen, and you are now?

00:34:43.706 --> 00:34:46.670
Adam Krakowski: Twenty-one.

00:34:46.670 --> 00:35:01.652
David Boder: [In English] This concludes a record by...taken from a young man, Adam Krakowski. He lives now in Paris.

00:35:01.652 --> 00:35:03.381
David Boder: [In German] Is your brother’s name also Krakowski?

00:35:03.381 --> 00:35:04.508
Adam Krakowski: Yes.

00:35:04.508 --> 00:35:32.062
David Boder: [In English] His brother, a long-time practicing physician here in this city...He is studying radio at the ORT and plans later to become a radio technician...radio man. He does not plan to leave the country. He neither thinks of going to the United States nor Palestine, nor any other place. He is apparently hoping to get set up here.
