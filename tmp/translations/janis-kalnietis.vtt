00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:17.459
David Boder: [In English] Munich, September 21, 1946 at a displaced peoples camp in for Latvian, Lithuanians and Estonians. The interview is Mr. Janis Kalnietis, 46 years old.

00:00:17.459 --> 00:00:18.421
David Boder: [In German] Are you a teacher?

00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:18.908
Janis Kalnietis: [In German] Yes.

00:00:18.908 --> 00:00:23.494
David Boder: [In English] He is a teacher here at the school. In gymnasium?

00:00:23.494 --> 00:00:23.868
Janis Kalnietis: [In German] No.

00:00:23.868 --> 00:01:28.897
David Boder: [In English]...in the elementary school. He just showed me a book which is printed here in Nürnberg with a number of pictures of Latvia, and the final pages are devoted to the so called...of the...em...horrors of the Soviets in Latvia. The question whether they have recorded any of the horrors caused by the Nazis. He says that so far, they don’t have the proper material. The name of the book is “Zeme, kas palika ugunis”, “The Land Which Has Remained in Fire”. I asked whether I can buy such a book. He was rather non-committal, but I may see whether I can get a copy. He wants talk in the Latvian, but we will make a trial to get up kind of a report.

00:01:28.897 --> 00:01:36.776
David Boder: [In Russian] Now, please, Mr Kalnietis take your hand off of your face and come closer.

00:01:36.776 --> 00:01:50.973
David Boder: [In Russian] Well, tell me where you were when the Russians first came, came again, to Latvia and what happened to you then? Speak in Latvian.

00:01:50.973 --> 00:02:14.589
Janis Kalnietis: [In Latvian] When the Bolsheviks came, I was in the countryside in Vidzeme; I was in Vidzeme. As a teacher, I had a vacation in the summer, and I was at my father’s.

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:15.041
David Boder: [In Russian/German] Well, yes. Go on.

00:02:15.041 --> 00:02:27.585
David Boder: [In Russian] Tell me everything that happened to you further; however, not what happened in general, but mainly what happened to you - everything that happened to you personally. Do you remember?

00:02:27.585 --> 00:02:24.444
Janis Kalnietis: [In Russian] Yes, yes.

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:30.310
David Boder: [In Russian] Now, do you want to speak? Do not wait for me to question you.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.006
Janis Kalnietis: [In Russian] In Latvian or in Russian?

00:02:31.006 --> 00:02:34.818
David Boder: [In Russian] Go on in the Latvian language.

00:02:34.818 --> 00:04:20.084
Janis Kalnietis: [In Latvian] It happened in summer, in the fall I had to start my work at school; then the Bolsheviks suspended me from duty—I was an assistant to the school superintendent—but I was degraded to a teacher, and then I was completely expelled from school. However, since they wanted to have a choir with a conductor, and they did not have one, they took me back on the condition that I would conduct their choir. This way, I stayed as a teacher for some time, but after having worked for a few months, I became aware that I was followed everywhere and the school superintendent was a communist who kept a special logbook on those teachers that were suspected of Bolshevism, improper for the Bolshevik regime, and incidentally, one of the teachers was lucky enough to come across this logbook on the table and read a few pages, and it was written there that Kalnietis on a certain day at a certain time, left home, was seen talking to this and that person in the street, then supposedly, on the national holiday in November, he had these and those visitors who left at this and that time—in short, I saw that I had someone spying on me.

00:04:20.084 --> 00:04:30.850
David Boder: [In Russian] Continue.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:05:10.603
Janis Kalnietis: [In Latvian] Without waiting, not waiting any longer, not waiting for the next event, I decided to disappear, to go to the woods, and several of us did so, all together. I spent the rest of the Bolshevik period in the woods, and I dared coming out of the woods only when the Germans came, and probably, I had acted in the right way or alternatively, I would have been sent to Siberia.

00:05:10.603 --> 00:05:21.098
David Boder: [In Russian] Now tell me what happened when the Bolshevi...when the Soviets left Latvia—in what way did they leave?

00:05:21.098 --> 00:06:35.321
Janis Kalnietis: [In Latvian] When the Bolsheviks were leaving Latvia, I think that we expected liberation from the Bolshevik terror, and with great pleasure, we watched the Germans coming to our country as our liberators, but our hopes vanished in a few days because, the first thing that the Germans did was rename streets in Riga. For example, Freedom Boulevard was renamed as Hitler Street, and there was Von der Goltss Street. Because Goltss was our most severe enemy in nineteen-nineteen against whom we shed our blood, and one of the main streets in Riga was named after him, For us, it was like spit in the face, at any rate, I personally felt it like that, and all Latvian thinking suddenly shifted again against the so called liberators—the Germans.

00:06:35.321 --> 00:06:37.269
David Boder: [In Russian] Now from the beginning.

00:06:37.269 --> 00:06:41.434
David Boder: Yes, now translate into the Russian language if you can.

00:06:41.434 --> 00:06:42.702
Janis Kalnietis: Yes, I can slightly.

00:06:42.702 --> 00:06:49.677
David Boder: Well, now tell me what else happened to you personally. What did you teach at school?

00:06:49.677 --> 00:06:52.277
Janis Kalnietis: I taught music at school.

00:06:52.277 --> 00:06:52.748
David Boder: A-ha.

00:06:52.748 --> 00:06:56.102
Janis Kalnietis: Music and also history lately.

00:06:56.102 --> 00:07:04.381
David Boder: A-ha, all right then. What had the Germans done there generally?

00:07:04.381 --> 00:07:21.750
Janis Kalnietis: The Germans allowed us to continue working, but in the school...the school was taken over for military, military troops, and we had to stay and work in a garage - six hundred.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:22.264
David Boder: The school?

00:07:22.264 --> 00:07:35.534
Janis Kalnietis: Yes, the school was located in one of the garages; six hundred pupils and twenty three teachers were working hmm...in four shifts every day; in fact, it was difficult to do it this way, but it was still possible to work.

00:07:35.534 --> 00:07:38.076
David Boder: At what time was each shift?

00:07:38.076 --> 00:07:38.706
Janis Kalnietis: What?

00:07:38.706 --> 00:07:42.538
David Boder: At what time was each shift? Well, what time did the first shift start?

00:07:42.538 --> 00:07:49.962
Janis Kalnietis: Oh, at seven, at seven o’ clock in the morning it started and finished late in the evening. We were working all day long.

00:07:49.962 --> 00:07:52.620
David Boder: How long was each shift?

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.162
Janis Kalnietis: Three to four hours for each shift.

00:07:55.162 --> 00:07:59.776
David Boder: Well, go on.

00:07:59.776 --> 00:08:02.796
Janis Kalnietis: Particularly, it was difficult to teach history.

00:08:02.796 --> 00:08:03.643
David Boder: Why?

00:08:03.643 --> 00:08:17.507
Janis Kalnietis: We could not, in any way, - we did not dare to explain to the children the year of nineteen-nineteen when the Germans attacked Latvia. They did not allow us to tell children what was true.

00:08:17.507 --> 00:08:18.268
David Boder: So.

00:08:18.268 --> 00:08:24.838
Janis Kalnietis: Our...

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:27.728
David Boder: You can go on in Latvian. Your what?

00:08:27.728 --> 00:08:31.748
Janis Kalnietis: One of our teachers who taught history...

00:08:31.748 --> 00:08:32.030
David Boder: So.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.051
Janis Kalnietis: . . . explained to the children the true story.

00:08:34.051 --> 00:08:34.362
David Boder: So?

00:08:34.362 --> 00:08:36.687
Janis Kalnietis: . . . and right away was dismissed...

00:08:36.687 --> 00:08:38.099
David Boder: . . . and was identified; it means that he

00:08:38.099 --> 00:08:39.671
Janis Kalnietis: . . . and he was dismissed.

00:08:39.671 --> 00:08:39.852
David Boder: So?

00:08:39.852 --> 00:08:44.756
Janis Kalnietis: And then nobody wanted to teach history.

00:08:44.756 --> 00:08:47.096
David Boder: So?

00:08:47.096 --> 00:09:09.159
Janis Kalnietis: Many of my acquaintances and friends among the Latvian intellectuals were put in jail by the Germans, were taken to concentration camps, and we were concerned, all the time, that we would have a similar destiny.

00:09:09.159 --> 00:09:13.208
David Boder: So. Mr. hmm...Kal e...nietis, tell me

00:09:13.208 --> 00:09:13.404
Janis Kalnietis: Yes.

00:09:13.404 --> 00:09:24.536
David Boder: Kalnietis. Here in this camp there are some Latvians who have been in West German concentration camps.

00:09:24.536 --> 00:09:27.078
David Boder: Yes, yes.

00:09:27.078 --> 00:09:29.345
Janis Kalnietis: I know one of the Latvians.

00:09:29.345 --> 00:09:32.119
David Boder: So, the one who was taken to the concentration camp by the Germans?

00:09:32.119 --> 00:09:33.720
Janis Kalnietis: Yes.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:41.737
David Boder: Well...how, no.—What was he taken for?

00:09:41.737 --> 00:09:47.798
Janis Kalnietis: Actually, during the German rule, Latvians published newspapers...

00:09:47.798 --> 00:09:48.059
David Boder: So?

00:09:48.059 --> 00:09:53.528
Janis Kalnietis: . . . that were against, against the Germans, duplicated by shapirographs and so...

00:09:53.528 --> 00:09:54.216
David Boder: Secret newspapers?

00:09:54.216 --> 00:10:01.647
Janis Kalnietis: Secret newspapers, and very many Latvian intellectuals worked there and distributed these newspapers.

00:10:01.647 --> 00:10:02.277
David Boder: Оh.

00:10:02.277 --> 00:10:07.557
Janis Kalnietis: And the Germans wanted all of them to go to Schwerin.

00:10:07.557 --> 00:10:08.716
David Boder: Eh...to exterminate.

00:10:08.716 --> 00:10:13.504
Janis Kalnietis: To exterminate. One of us in our camp, that I know of.

00:10:13.504 --> 00:10:19.820
David Boder: So. Now tell me, when the work for covert newspapers against the Germans was not being done...

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:19.980
Janis Kalnietis: Yes.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:25.865
David Boder: . . . were they pro-Russian or not? How was it?

00:10:25.865 --> 00:10:28.337
Janis Kalnietis: Simply Latvian nationalists.

00:10:28.337 --> 00:10:29.632
David Boder: Were they Nazi nationalists?

00:10:29.632 --> 00:10:31.272
Janis Kalnietis: Latvian nationalists.

00:10:31.272 --> 00:10:34.748
David Boder: So, they were against the Germans, but they were not for the Russians?

00:10:34.748 --> 00:10:37.361
Janis Kalnietis: Against the Germans and against the Russians.

00:10:37.361 --> 00:10:38.138
David Boder: ?h, so it was.

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:39.072
Janis Kalnietis: Yes.

00:10:39.072 --> 00:10:43.302
David Boder: Well, tell me, were any kind of partisans there?

00:10:43.302 --> 00:10:43.953
Janis Kalnietis: In Latvia?

00:10:43.953 --> 00:10:45.107
David Boder: Yes.

00:10:45.107 --> 00:10:53.998
Janis Kalnietis: Yes, during that time partisans operated in Latvia and during the nineteen forties, in fact, under the Bolsheviks.

00:10:53.998 --> 00:10:55.622
David Boder: But together with the Bolsheviks or against the Bolsheviks?

00:10:55.622 --> 00:10:56.854
Janis Kalnietis: Against the Bolsheviks.

00:10:56.854 --> 00:10:57.207
David Boder: So.

00:10:57.207 --> 00:10:58.643
Janis Kalnietis: During the Bolshevik times.

00:10:58.643 --> 00:11:01.115
David Boder: So they, they struggled against the Bolsheviks?

00:11:01.115 --> 00:11:01.484
Janis Kalnietis: Yes.

00:11:01.484 --> 00:11:03.061
David Boder: So and then?

00:11:03.061 --> 00:11:06.788
Janis Kalnietis: And during the German rule - against Germans.

00:11:06.788 --> 00:11:10.798
David Boder: Simply they were just Latvian nationalists.

00:11:10.798 --> 00:11:23.000
Janis Kalnietis: Latvian nationalists, and all who did not wa...hmm...who were forced to join the German army, but did not want to join the army, and there were many of those.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:31.420
David Boder: Yes, now tell me something, in which town did you live?

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:32.574
Janis Kalnietis: In Rujiena.

00:11:32.574 --> 00:11:34.763
David Boder: Rujienaa—what is it called in Russian?

00:11:34.763 --> 00:11:36.246
Janis Kalnietis: It is the same - Rujiena.

00:11:36.246 --> 00:11:37.478
David Boder: Rujiena. Where is it?

00:11:37.478 --> 00:11:40.154
Janis Kalnietis: Near the Estonian border.

00:11:40.154 --> 00:11:43.348
David Boder: Near the Estonian border, but you are from Latvia, aren’t you?

00:11:43.348 --> 00:11:43.795
Janis Kalnietis: Yes, I am.

00:11:43.795 --> 00:11:50.802
David Boder: You in Latvia—did you know what the Germans did to the Jews?

00:11:50.802 --> 00:12:08.050
Janis Kalnietis: In my town there were very few Jews. I think that there were only fourteen people, and I knew all of them very well; however, I do not know their data.

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:08.560
David Boder: So.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:28.883
Janis Kalnietis: But I know that all of those fourteen Jews were gathered by the Germans, and taken some nineteen kilometers away from the town, and during the night they were shot dead and buried in the forest. Everybody saw that and knew about that.

00:12:28.883 --> 00:12:29.613
David Boder: What happened?

00:12:29.613 --> 00:12:52.755
Janis Kalnietis: What happened there? They wanted to force the Latvian policemen to shoot people, but they all ran away. The Germans could not find anybody who would be willing to assist them, and they took them away themselves by a truck and shot them dead; everybody knows about it very well.

00:12:52.755 --> 00:12:55.415
David Boder: But tell me how it was under the Ulmanis rule.

00:12:55.415 --> 00:12:56.004
Janis Kalnietis: Yes.

00:12:56.004 --> 00:12:58.790
David Boder: Were the Jews free in Latvia?

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:01.497
Janis Kalnietis: Yes, under the Ulmanis rule, all were free.

00:13:01.497 --> 00:13:07.359
David Boder: But why is it said that they were forced to sell their real estate to the Latvians?

00:13:07.359 --> 00:13:08.795
Janis Kalnietis: But I do not know about that.

00:13:08.795 --> 00:13:09.258
David Boder: You do not know.

00:13:09.258 --> 00:13:11.228
Janis Kalnietis: I do not know about it. But I...

00:13:11.228 --> 00:13:13.747
David Boder: I have told you what people say in America?

00:13:13.747 --> 00:13:14.194
Janis Kalnietis: Yes.

00:13:14.194 --> 00:13:31.293
David Boder: That under the Ulmanis rule, when he dismissed the parliament, they went to the Jews and told them to sell their real estate to the Latvian citizens and that they did not want the Jews to have real estate and so on. Do you know anything about that?

00:13:31.293 --> 00:13:55.517
Janis Kalnietis: But I saw that under the Ulmanis rule only a few large factories were taken, taken by the Latvian government, however, I do not know about the private real estate. Also, all stores in Riga and other cities—all of them stayed as they were before.

00:13:55.517 --> 00:13:55.697
David Boder: So.

00:13:55.697 --> 00:14:20.125
Janis Kalnietis: But I think that Ulmanis wanted to apply a policy in which all large plants should be taken over by the government irrespective of the owner—be it a Jew, or a German or a Russian, or a Latvian, - irrespective of that. I think that this is what Ulmanis’ policy was about.

00:14:20.125 --> 00:14:37.004
David Boder: Now tell me this. Under the rule of Ulmanis and the Latvian government and independence, what was done to the German estates? Were these estates divided or were they still owned by German barons?

00:14:37.004 --> 00:14:42.301
Janis Kalnietis: They were divided during the first years of Latvian independence.

00:14:42.301 --> 00:14:42.748
David Boder: ?-ha.

00:14:42.748 --> 00:15:00.693
Janis Kalnietis: Each and every person of the new Latvian peasantry, who was in the war, came from the war and received ten, fifteen, twenty, thirty hectares, when all German estates had been divided.

00:15:00.693 --> 00:15:04.624
David Boder: But some of the German barons stayed there, didn’t they?

00:15:04.624 --> 00:15:18.599
Janis Kalnietis: There were very few German barons left, but those who stayed also got twenty, thirty hectares, and they had to work themselves the same way the Latvians worked.

00:15:18.599 --> 00:15:29.263
David Boder: But tell me about the time when the Germans came. Did they try to deprive the Latvians of land? Or did they leave all of that as it was?

00:15:29.263 --> 00:15:55.152
Janis Kalnietis: The Germans seemed not to have managed to do it during the war, but everybody understood that they had it in mind. For example, their policy regarding schools was aimed at leaving only primary and vocational schools for the Latvians and so that we had to...we, well...we could be more like servants.

00:15:55.152 --> 00:15:56.007
David Boder: Servants.

00:15:56.007 --> 00:15:56.901
Janis Kalnietis: Servants to the Germans.

00:15:56.901 --> 00:15:57.458
David Boder: So.

00:15:57.458 --> 00:16:03.335
Janis Kalnietis: This policy was obvious, however, they did not have enough time to implement it all.

00:16:03.335 --> 00:16:07.502
David Boder: Now, what did they do with Riga university?

00:16:07.502 --> 00:16:08.153
Janis Kalnietis: The Germans.

00:16:08.153 --> 00:16:08.898
David Boder: Hм...

00:16:08.898 --> 00:16:12.453
Janis Kalnietis: I was not in Riga; I was in the province, and I do not know well enough.

00:16:12.453 --> 00:16:13.151
David Boder: ?-ha...

00:16:13.151 --> 00:16:13.802
Janis Kalnietis: I cannot say anything.

00:16:13.802 --> 00:16:21.296
David Boder: You cannot say anything about it. Now, tell me what happened to you when the Germans started leaving? With you personally.

00:16:21.296 --> 00:16:22.214
Janis Kalnietis: Leaving?

00:16:22.214 --> 00:16:22.630
David Boder: Yes.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:27.142
Janis Kalnietis: It was during that fall, I had been again working at school.

00:16:27.142 --> 00:16:27.872
David Boder: Yes.

00:16:27.872 --> 00:16:42.239
Janis Kalnietis: In Rujiena, there was an order received from the German commander that all of us should leave the town.

00:16:42.239 --> 00:16:43.236
David Boder: All inhabitants.

00:16:43.236 --> 00:16:43.981
Janis Kalnietis: All inhabitants.

00:16:43.981 --> 00:16:44.350
David Boder: Yes.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:55.576
Janis Kalnietis: So I did, and I fixed a cart and set out, but I did not make it far with the cart, because a tank damaged the cart, and we continued to go on foot.

00:16:55.576 --> 00:16:57.138
David Boder: How did the tank make the damage?

00:16:57.138 --> 00:17:01.312
Janis Kalnietis: It was an accident at night, at night.

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:02.701
David Boder: So, did you have a horse?

00:17:02.701 --> 00:17:10.155
Janis Kalnietis: The horse was killed, and all Germans looted my clothes and everything, and I just walked away as I was.

00:17:10.155 --> 00:17:12.376
David Boder: How many of you were in the household?

00:17:12.376 --> 00:17:13.137
Janis Kalnietis: In the household?

00:17:13.137 --> 00:17:13.569
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:16.857
Janis Kalnietis: Eh, I had my wife, my father and mother.

00:17:16.857 --> 00:17:17.987
David Boder: A-ha. You did not have children.

00:17:17.987 --> 00:17:19.046
Janis Kalnietis: No, we did not have children.

00:17:19.046 --> 00:17:24.249
David Boder: Well, now let us express ourselves a bit shorter to fit into those four minutes left. Can we?

00:17:24.249 --> 00:17:25.308
Janis Kalnietis: Yes.

00:17:25.308 --> 00:17:32.845
David Boder: Even though I would not like to rush you, we can proceed. Tell me, in fact, then you got out of Latvia. Where to?

00:17:32.845 --> 00:17:35.788
Janis Kalnietis: I was sent from Latvia to Gottenhafen.

00:17:35.788 --> 00:17:36.031
David Boder: ?-hа.

00:17:36.031 --> 00:17:40.323
Janis Kalnietis: . . . and from there to Bromberg. It is a big city in Westpreussen.

00:17:40.323 --> 00:17:40.660
David Boder: So.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.147
Janis Kalnietis: On the previous Polish border.

00:17:43.147 --> 00:17:44.818
David Boder: So, and what did you do there?

00:17:44.818 --> 00:17:51.982
Janis Kalnietis: There I was placed in one of the factories, a carpentry factory, as a night stoker.

00:17:51.982 --> 00:17:52.193
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:52.193 --> 00:17:55.057
Janis Kalnietis: I had to be a stoker, tending the fires of furnaces.

00:17:55.057 --> 00:17:55.897
David Boder: So.

00:17:55.897 --> 00:18:10.061
Janis Kalnietis: And there I had been working for two months, and then again we fled from there. The Germans took me along, and I got here in Brunnau, there I had less...in Brunnau. It is not far from Munich.

00:18:10.061 --> 00:18:10.414
David Boder: So.

00:18:10.414 --> 00:18:17.060
Janis Kalnietis: There I was placed in a hospital to work; I had to work with coal.

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:18.622
David Boder: And where is your wife?

00:18:18.622 --> 00:18:22.004
Janis Kalnietis: My wife stayed in Latvia. We were not together.

00:18:22.004 --> 00:18:23.220
David Boder: Your wife stayed in Latvia, didn’t she?

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:26.084
Janis Kalnietis: She stayed in Latvia, and so she is now.

00:18:26.084 --> 00:18:27.410
David Boder: And your parents?

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:28.626
Janis Kalnietis: They are also in Latvia.

00:18:28.626 --> 00:18:29.324
David Boder: So, you are alone?

00:18:29.324 --> 00:18:30.933
Janis Kalnietis: Just alone.

00:18:30.933 --> 00:18:33.625
David Boder: Do you write, receive letters from your wife?

00:18:33.625 --> 00:18:35.155
Janis Kalnietis: I do not want to write.

00:18:35.155 --> 00:18:37.030
David Boder: And by “The Red Cross”?

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:38.089
Janis Kalnietis: I am afraid.

00:18:38.089 --> 00:18:41.251
David Boder: You are afraid. So, does she know that you are alive or does she not know?

00:18:41.251 --> 00:18:45.135
Janis Kalnietis: She does not know.

00:18:45.135 --> 00:18:47.921
David Boder: Have you tried to write or send something through America?

00:18:47.921 --> 00:19:07.609
Janis Kalnietis: I have not tried. I am afraid. I know from the nineteen forties that those who received letters from somewhere abroad, those got lost; therefore, I am afraid to write. It is not because of me, it is because of others.

00:19:07.609 --> 00:19:12.105
David Boder: Now, tell me about where were you released then?

00:19:12.105 --> 00:19:13.219
Janis Kalnietis: Here in Germany?

00:19:13.219 --> 00:19:14.121
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:14.121 --> 00:19:16.734
Janis Kalnietis: In Brunnau, in the hospital where I worked.

00:19:16.734 --> 00:19:17.950
David Boder: And who came there?

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:20.186
Janis Kalnietis: Americans came.

00:19:20.186 --> 00:19:26.832
David Boder: Now, tell me what are you going to do now?

00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:34.765
Janis Kalnietis: It is difficult to answer, but I think that I have to wait until everything gets clarified.

00:19:34.765 --> 00:19:36.876
David Boder: What do you mean?

00:19:36.876 --> 00:19:41.514
Janis Kalnietis: With my parents, my wife, and in general in Latvia.

00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:47.187
David Boder: Well, do you think that there will be a change in Latvia soon?

00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:52.625
Janis Kalnietis: Well, what else can I think of?

00:19:52.625 --> 00:19:53.245
David Boder: I do not know.

00:19:53.245 --> 00:19:58.385
Janis Kalnietis: We all expect that, perhaps, there will be a change.

00:19:58.385 --> 00:20:08.751
David Boder: But one should not go on living in camps, barracks and similar places for so long. It is necessary that some of your queries get resolved.

00:20:08.751 --> 00:20:24.895
Janis Kalnietis: It does not matter for me. I am just alone. I can work and take on any physical work. I am ready for everything, ready for everything that the Americans would...

00:20:24.895 --> 00:20:26.347
David Boder: Offer.

00:20:26.347 --> 00:20:48.258
Janis Kalnietis: . . . would offer. I trust England and America. I know very well, I know that all of us Latvians can expect everything good only from those two nations, but not from others—it is in my opinion.

00:20:48.258 --> 00:20:47.895
David Boder: [In English] This concludes spool four hundred forty-two.
