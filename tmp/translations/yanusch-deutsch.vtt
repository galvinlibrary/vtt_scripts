David Boder: How many people were there in your family?

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.979
Yanusch Deutsch: Well, my parents, they are alone.

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:59.352

David Boder: Yes.

00:01:19.632 --> 00:01:24.096
Yanusch Deutsch: And we could live calmly until 1944.

00:01:24.096 --> 00:01:25.135
David Boder: Yes.

00:01:25.135 --> 00:01:30.254
Yanusch Deutsch: The [unintelligible; something with “architect”?] was not so big in Hungary, so we could calmly live there.

00:01:30.254 --> 00:01:30.918
David Boder: Yes.

00:01:30.918 --> 00:01:48.378
Yanusch Deutsch: And we heard the news from Germany and the occupied territories where the Germans were. What, what terrible things they did to the Jews. We never thought that the same could happen to us.

00:01:48.378 --> 00:01:50.259
David Boder: Yes.

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:56.837
Yanusch Deutsch: In ’44, 20 March the Germans conquered Hungary.

00:01:56.837 --> 00:01:57.885
David Boder: Yes.

00:01:57.885 --> 00:02:00.337
Yanusch Deutsch: There was no object.Translator’s note: He confuses the German words “Gegenstand” and “Widerstand,” meaning “object” and “resistance,” respectively.1

00:02:00.337 --> 00:02:00.955
David Boder: I see.

00:02:00.955 --> 00:02:07.084
Yanusch Deutsch: And the Jew—, the Germans, of course, immediately took measures against the Jews.

00:02:07.084 --> 00:02:07.430
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.396
Yanusch Deutsch: Yes, Star [of David] and [inaudible].

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:11.912
David Boder: [unintelligible; possibly something in English?]

00:02:11.912 --> 00:02:17.854
Yanusch Deutsch: Every country is the same. [unintelligible] what happened in Germany, only much, much faster.

00:02:17.854 --> 00:02:21.363
David Boder: So, for example, what did they do? Let’s forget that we already know that.

00:02:21.363 --> 00:02:25.359
Yanusch Deutsch: Yes, well, [unintelligible].

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:30.758
David Boder: How was it announced that one was supposed to wear the Stars?

00:02:30.758 --> 00:02:33.247
Yanusch Deutsch: Twelve days after the Germans...

00:02:33.247 --> 00:02:33.509
David Boder: [unintelligible]

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:36.157
Yanusch Deutsch: . . . occupied Hungary,

00:02:36.157 --> 00:02:37.411
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:47.835
Yanusch Deutsch: . . . in the papers there appeared articles that the Jews, eh, six, I mean have to wear Magen David.

00:02:47.835 --> 00:02:49.267
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:49.267 --> 00:02:53.749
Yanusch Deutsch: Ten centimeters large, made from yellow, yellow...

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:54.329
David Boder: Cloth?

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:55.022
Yanusch Deutsch: Cloth.

00:02:55.022 --> 00:02:56.061
David Boder: Yes, out of yellow cloth.

00:02:56.061 --> 00:02:56.641
Yanusch Deutsch: Yes, yellow cloth.

00:02:56.641 --> 00:03:00.038
David Boder: And where did one get these? Were they sold, or what?

00:03:00.038 --> 00:03:07.309
Yanusch Deutsch: We had to make them ourselves, and Jewish merchants, Jewish, I mean, salesmen sold it.

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:08.263
David Boder: They sold it?

00:03:08.263 --> 00:03:08.661
Yanusch Deutsch: Yes.

00:03:08.661 --> 00:03:10.616
David Boder: How much did they take for it?

00:03:10.616 --> 00:03:13.238
Yanusch Deutsch: Well, I don’t know, twenty, thirty drachmas, well...

00:03:13.238 --> 00:03:14.377
David Boder: Twenty, thirty drachmas. So they...

00:03:14.377 --> 00:03:22.734
Yanusch Deutsch: [interrupts] Most often nothing, most often nothing at all, because they knew, after all, that they not have their businesses much longer, so why should they earn anything.

00:03:22.734 --> 00:03:26.653
David Boder: Yes. Well?

00:03:26.653 --> 00:03:34.555
Yanusch Deutsch: And then things proceeded quite rapidly. At first, the businessmen had to lock their businesses.

00:03:34.555 --> 00:03:35.426
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:35.426 --> 00:03:45.626
Yanusch Deutsch: And then they had to hand in cameras, radios, typewriters, [unintelligible; possibly “little treasures”?], everything.

00:03:45.626 --> 00:03:46.543
David Boder: [unintelligible]

00:03:46.543 --> 00:03:47.525
Yanusch Deutsch: [unintelligible]

00:03:47.525 --> 00:03:53.158
David Boder: Yes. Well?

00:03:53.158 --> 00:03:59.244
Yanusch Deutsch: And then we immediately had to hand in all the gold and, how does one say, “schmucksachen”?

00:03:59.244 --> 00:03:59.774
David Boder: Jewelry.

00:03:59.774 --> 00:04:10.841
Yanusch Deutsch: Jewelry. And money that we had in the bank, that we had saved, and absolutely nothing of it we could receive.

00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:15.442
David Boder: Speak [possibly: “try”?] English, don’t mind the pronunciation, go on.

00:04:15.442 --> 00:04:45.681
Yanusch Deutsch: [In English]...I’ll try. But it was not only this loss against us but the German SS soldiers came every day and they asked us...Do you know that in every town there was a Judenrat [Jewish Council]—there were Judenräte with Judenalteste. And they came every day and they asked us food...[break in tape]...jewels, everything they liked.

00:04:45.681 --> 00:04:47.061
David Boder: Who? The Judenrat?

00:04:47.061 --> 00:04:56.464
Yanusch Deutsch: From the Judenrat, the SS soldiers and the Judenrat—it was the duty of the Judenrat—to get these things.

00:04:56.464 --> 00:04:59.400
David Boder: Oh. The SS came to the Judenrat?

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.844
Yanusch Deutsch: Yes.

00:04:59.844 --> 00:05:02.012
David Boder: And the Judenrat had to go to the Jews...

00:05:02.012 --> 00:05:02.267
Yanusch Deutsch: Yes.

00:05:02.267 --> 00:05:05.814
David Boder: . . . to get it. Nu. All right. That’s very good. Go ahead.

00:05:05.814 --> 00:05:15.802
Yanusch Deutsch: Yes. And after two month and a half who had to go to the ghetto.

00:05:15.802 --> 00:05:16.888
David Boder: Now how was that?

00:05:16.888 --> 00:05:33.941
Yanusch Deutsch: Well in all town it was like that. First we had to leave...there were only some houses for the Jews and on the door of these houses there was—were a big gold star.

00:05:33.941 --> 00:05:34.411
David Boder: Ja.

00:05:34.411 --> 00:05:36.247
Yanusch Deutsch: A yellow star.

00:05:36.247 --> 00:05:37.772
David Boder: Yes.

00:05:37.772 --> 00:05:49.802
Yanusch Deutsch: And we were living in our flat twenty-four persons. Before [unintelligible] we had four rooms and we lived there twenty-four persons.

00:05:49.802 --> 00:05:51.299
David Boder: So they left you in your flat...

00:05:51.299 --> 00:05:51.859
Yanusch Deutsch: Yes.

00:05:51.859 --> 00:05:58.387
David Boder: But who got you the twenty-four persons? Who told you to take in the twenty-four persons?

00:05:58.387 --> 00:06:18.441
Yanusch Deutsch: The SS soldiers told the Judenrat on Monday that for Friday they did had these houses—I think it was hundred and twenty houses—and they must get there...still Friday evening.

00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:20.044
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:20.044 --> 00:06:30.538
Yanusch Deutsch: And it was very difficult business because we hadn’t had any car and we had to take the furnitures ourselves.

00:06:30.538 --> 00:06:32.637
David Boder: So you had to move out from your...

00:06:32.637 --> 00:06:40.008
Yanusch Deutsch: No. Fortunately we didn’t move out—then. We lived that for one week. You can imagine that..

00:06:40.008 --> 00:06:41.518
David Boder: That you took in other people?

00:06:41.518 --> 00:06:48.412
Yanusch Deutsch: Other...twenty-one persons. [speaking over each other] We were twenty-four. Well you can imagine it because...

00:06:48.412 --> 00:06:49.565
David Boder: Well...

00:06:49.565 --> 00:07:03.593
Yanusch Deutsch: . . . twenty-four people...brought with them their furnitures and their things and the flat was crowded and we couldn’t move and we had only one kitchen and there were five or six familie—, families.

00:07:03.593 --> 00:07:07.488
David Boder: Yes. And how many rooms did you have?

00:07:07.488 --> 00:07:08.610
Yanusch Deutsch: Four big rooms.

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:09.100
David Boder: What?

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:09.623
Yanusch Deutsch: Four.

00:07:09.623 --> 00:07:10.729
David Boder: Four rooms and a kitchen.

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:11.164
Yanusch Deutsch: Yes.

00:07:11.164 --> 00:07:13.170
David Boder: Yes. Nu.

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:19.408
Yanusch Deutsch: And, for instance, my mother and I—and me—slept in the kitchen.

00:07:19.408 --> 00:07:20.064
David Boder: Ja.

00:07:20.064 --> 00:07:29.425
Yanusch Deutsch: And they were cooking in the kitchen all day and night. We were cooking from eight o’clock until ten o’clock, other families from ten o’clock until twelve...

00:07:29.425 --> 00:07:30.423
David Boder: Ja.

00:07:30.423 --> 00:07:46.638
Yanusch Deutsch: . . . other families in the afternoon. So we lived there for one week. We knew...we knew that they would deport us and we had to get some food and we wanted to eat it very quickly.

00:07:46.638 --> 00:07:49.561
David Boder: All right.

00:07:49.561 --> 00:07:53.017
Yanusch Deutsch: And, one morning...

00:07:53.017 --> 00:07:57.599
David Boder: You said you wanted to eat your food as quick as possible because you knew that what?

00:07:57.599 --> 00:08:06.959
Yanusch Deutsch: Well, it very good things [?] and we were...I can say we were then happy. It was the last happy days of my life.

00:08:06.959 --> 00:08:07.870
David Boder: Ja.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:20.903
Yanusch Deutsch: And one morning, suddenly, at four o’clock German soldiers came in our house and they ordered the men in the yard...on the yard.

00:08:20.903 --> 00:08:21.902
David Boder: Ja. Only the men?

00:08:21.902 --> 00:08:36.057
Yanusch Deutsch: Only the men. And they told them that they would give us one hour. In one hour we must move out. We can take with us thirty kilos of baggages.

00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:37.521
David Boder: Each person?

00:08:37.521 --> 00:08:38.155
Yanusch Deutsch: Yes.

00:08:38.155 --> 00:08:41.032
David Boder: Ja. How old were you then?

00:08:41.032 --> 00:09:10.271
Yanusch Deutsch: I was then fifteen years old...and some months. Well, you can imagine we hadn’t had much time. We had to clothe—to dress ourselves—and we take some food and some clothes and everything we knew—everything we knew it would be useful. Then they take us on the yard and they...how do you say in English [German phrase]?

00:09:10.271 --> 00:09:11.116
David Boder: And they searched you?

00:09:11.116 --> 00:09:25.026
Yanusch Deutsch: They searched us. They took the good things away from us: the chocolate, the coffee, the sugar...confiture [jam], the jam, and we remained with very little baggages.

00:09:25.026 --> 00:09:26.475
David Boder: Ja.

00:09:26.475 --> 00:09:32.639
Yanusch Deutsch: And then we had to remain there from six o’clock in the morning until two o’clock in the night.

00:09:32.639 --> 00:09:33.653
David Boder: In the yard?

00:09:33.653 --> 00:09:35.450
Yanusch Deutsch: Yes. It was [great fun?].

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.252
David Boder: The men alone or everybody?

00:09:37.252 --> 00:09:59.257
Yanusch Deutsch: Everybody—together. And you know the search was very...very strong...and we had to undress and so everywhere and they give me slaps and they kick me.

00:09:59.257 --> 00:10:02.211
David Boder: Where did you have to undress?

00:10:02.211 --> 00:10:03.306
Yanusch Deutsch: In a room.

00:10:03.306 --> 00:10:04.612
David Boder: In a separate room?

00:10:04.612 --> 00:10:16.322
Yanusch Deutsch: A separate room, the men...separate from the women. And at two o’clock they came and they took us to the [brick?] factory.

00:10:16.322 --> 00:10:17.340
David Boder: Two o’clock at night?

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.155
Yanusch Deutsch: In the night.

00:10:18.155 --> 00:10:18.743
David Boder: In the night.

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:27.427
Yanusch Deutsch: You know, in Hungary I think almost each town they take the Jews in a [brick?] factory.

00:10:27.427 --> 00:10:28.722
David Boder: Why?

00:10:28.722 --> 00:10:34.764
Yanusch Deutsch: I don’t know. Because, you how it looks like...

00:10:34.764 --> 00:10:35.613
David Boder: A [brick?] factory?

00:10:35.613 --> 00:10:51.691
Yanusch Deutsch: Yes. We were slept on the ground. We didn’t have any straw—nothing to sleep on and we hadn’t food. We had even less food than in Bergen-Belsen.

00:10:51.691 --> 00:10:52.817
David Boder: Yes.

00:10:52.817 --> 00:10:56.370
Yanusch Deutsch: And we were there...

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:59.262
David Boder: Oh! You said you did...you had some food with you?

00:10:59.262 --> 00:11:16.241
Yanusch Deutsch: They took everything away [they saw?]. Almost everything. They give us food for three days we were there for more than a fortnight.

00:11:16.241 --> 00:11:19.241
David Boder: They gave you food or they allowed you to have food?

00:11:19.241 --> 00:11:22.994
Yanusch Deutsch: Yes. And they took away the food.

00:11:22.994 --> 00:11:29.788
David Boder: Now let’s have that clear. They gave you food—German food, bread and so on or they allowed you to take food...

00:11:29.788 --> 00:11:41.847
Yanusch Deutsch: They allowed...they allowed us to take food with us and then they took away the good things—the sugar, the chocolate, the coffee, although we had bread and I don’t know...

00:11:41.847 --> 00:11:45.477
David Boder: Tell me, and the Judenrat was also deported?

00:11:45.477 --> 00:12:02.197
Yanusch Deutsch: Everybody. And you know that in Hungary there was some people who fought in the war and who were Jews but they had to go to the ghetto. But they had to go to the [brick?] factory and they were deported too.

00:12:02.197 --> 00:12:03.615
David Boder: A-ha. Nu?

00:12:03.615 --> 00:12:10.947
Yanusch Deutsch: And in the [brick?] factory we had half a liter of soap in a day...

00:12:10.947 --> 00:12:11.402
David Boder: Soup?

00:12:11.402 --> 00:12:17.044
Yanusch Deutsch: . . . of soup and hundred-fifty grams of bread.

00:12:17.044 --> 00:12:17.924
David Boder: Ja.

00:12:17.924 --> 00:12:27.617
Yanusch Deutsch: Nothing more. And it was very bad too because we hadn’t any...any stuff or any fat. You know...fat. It was very bad.

00:12:27.617 --> 00:12:29.281
David Boder: What month was it?

00:12:29.281 --> 00:12:32.726
Yanusch Deutsch: It was...June.

00:12:32.726 --> 00:12:33.867
David Boder: June?

00:12:33.867 --> 00:12:34.098
Yanusch Deutsch: June.

00:12:34.098 --> 00:12:36.898
David Boder: And what was the name of your city?

00:12:36.898 --> 00:12:39.955
Yanusch Deutsch: Székesfehérvár, Stuhlweissenburg

00:12:39.955 --> 00:12:40.278
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:40.278 --> 00:12:41.101
Yanusch Deutsch: . . . in German.

00:12:41.101 --> 00:12:42.150
David Boder: Nu.

00:12:42.150 --> 00:13:15.046
Yanusch Deutsch: And then they took...one morning they said that they will take us away from our town and we must get out from the [brick?] factory and we must go to the station, the railway station. Well, the last minute there came a wire saying that twenty-six people are going to Budapest are not going to the transport but are going to Budapest and we were in this twenty-six people.

00:13:15.046 --> 00:13:17.140
David Boder: Why?

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:18.942
Yanusch Deutsch: We have these Zionists.

00:13:18.942 --> 00:13:19.838
David Boder: Zionists. Yes.

00:13:19.838 --> 00:13:30.165
Yanusch Deutsch: Zionists. And you know that in every...in every country, the German...

00:13:30.165 --> 00:13:31.194
David Boder: The Gestapo?

00:13:31.194 --> 00:13:34.103
Yanusch Deutsch: . . . the Gestapo...now how do you say it?

00:13:34.103 --> 00:13:36.578
David Boder: [clarifying in German]

00:13:36.578 --> 00:13:38.311
Yanusch Deutsch: [German phrase]

00:13:38.311 --> 00:13:40.246
David Boder: The Germans have taken...

00:13:40.246 --> 00:13:57.857
Yanusch Deutsch: . . . they have taken. There was a business with the Germans that they can take us...I don’t know, some Jews to Palestine. It was an Aliyah [immigration or pilgrimage to Palestine], it was...made by the Joint.

00:13:57.857 --> 00:14:01.687
David Boder: Oh, the Germans had an arrangement that they can take to Palestine...

00:14:01.687 --> 00:14:01.880
Yanusch Deutsch: Ja.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.974
David Boder: . . . some of the Jews. Nu.

00:14:03.974 --> 00:14:19.143
Yanusch Deutsch: And they have taken us to Budapest in a camp and we were there six hundred people, later on we were nine hundred there.

00:14:19.143 --> 00:14:21.048
David Boder: And they told you that you would go to Palestine?

00:14:21.048 --> 00:14:45.064
Yanusch Deutsch: To Palestine. And then one day they took us and they deported us who were...they had taken us to Bergen-Belsen. We were in a wagon seventy-nine people we couldn’t sleep, we couldn’t sit, we could only stand. Because there was not any place.

00:14:45.064 --> 00:14:47.588
David Boder: Did you have a toilet in your car?

00:14:47.588 --> 00:14:48.238
Yanusch Deutsch: No.

00:14:48.238 --> 00:14:49.164
David Boder: What did you do?

00:14:49.164 --> 00:14:51.545
Yanusch Deutsch: It was wagon for the cows. You know?

00:14:51.545 --> 00:14:55.206
David Boder: Ja. So what did you do when you needed to go to the toilet?

00:14:55.206 --> 00:15:03.552
Yanusch Deutsch: Well, it was very bad because once a day the train stopped and we had to make it then.

00:15:03.552 --> 00:15:04.156
David Boder: To go out?

00:15:04.156 --> 00:15:05.267
Yanusch Deutsch: To go out.

00:15:05.267 --> 00:15:11.954
David Boder: And if not...otherwise? Otherwise...?

00:15:11.954 --> 00:15:22.435
Yanusch Deutsch: Well, otherwise...we had jugs there...we had with us jugs...

00:15:22.435 --> 00:15:26.111
David Boder: And how would you do it? There were people around?

00:15:26.111 --> 00:15:27.928
Yanusch Deutsch: We had to do it.

00:15:27.928 --> 00:15:30.575
David Boder: Uh-huh And the women?

00:15:30.575 --> 00:15:31.686
Yanusch Deutsch: Women too.

00:15:31.686 --> 00:15:32.582
David Boder: Well the women too.

00:15:32.582 --> 00:15:40.175
Yanusch Deutsch: It was daytime was quite dark too because it was...the door was shut. You know?

00:15:40.175 --> 00:15:40.687
David Boder: Ja.

00:15:40.687 --> 00:15:42.059
Yanusch Deutsch: We couldn’t see.

00:15:42.059 --> 00:15:48.776
David Boder: Ja, so they could...satisfy their needs, eliminate in that way.

00:15:48.776 --> 00:15:56.830
Yanusch Deutsch: And then. They have taken us to Vienna and from Vienna to Linz.

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:57.142
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:57.142 --> 00:16:07.070
Yanusch Deutsch: Well, in Linz it was a very strange thing because they take us...we arrived at Linz at seven o’clock in the morning.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:11.284
David Boder: Ja, Linz is near the...Swiss Border isn’t it?

00:16:11.284 --> 00:16:12.564
Yanusch Deutsch: Hundred fifty kilometers.

00:16:12.564 --> 00:16:13.813
David Boder: Ja. Nu?

00:16:13.813 --> 00:16:18.011
Yanusch Deutsch: And then they told us they will take us to bathe.

00:16:18.011 --> 00:16:18.487
David Boder: To where?

00:16:18.487 --> 00:16:19.367
Yanusch Deutsch: To bathe.

00:16:19.367 --> 00:16:20.995
David Boder: Where is that? To Bathe?

00:16:20.995 --> 00:16:23.146
Yanusch Deutsch: To bathe...baden.

00:16:23.146 --> 00:16:24.579
David Boder: A-ha. Yes.

00:16:24.579 --> 00:16:27.913
Yanusch Deutsch: And they took first the women.

00:16:27.913 --> 00:16:29.177
David Boder: To Switzerland?

00:16:29.177 --> 00:16:32.434
Yanusch Deutsch: No, it was to bathe...baden.

00:16:32.434 --> 00:16:35.096
David Boder: To bathe...to take a bath.

00:16:35.096 --> 00:16:47.271
Yanusch Deutsch: To take a bath. They took the women first at seven o’clock in the morning and at three o’clock in the afternoon nobody came back. We were afraid: “What did they do with the women?”

00:16:47.271 --> 00:16:49.933
David Boder: Why didn’t they take you or your father?

00:16:49.933 --> 00:16:52.191
Yanusch Deutsch: First they said they would take the women.

00:16:52.191 --> 00:16:53.624
David Boder: Oh, they took the women first?

00:16:53.624 --> 00:17:05.184
Yanusch Deutsch: Yes. Then at three o’clock they came back without the women and they took us [Boder interrupts]...yes...with the women.

00:17:05.184 --> 00:17:08.507
David Boder: . . . and what happened to them?

00:17:08.507 --> 00:17:20.685
Yanusch Deutsch: We didn’t see the women but the soldiers came back [unintelligible]. And I was very afraid that they would take us in a vernichtungslager. I wanted to escape. And I tried...

00:17:20.685 --> 00:17:22.144
David Boder: A vernichtungslager?

00:17:22.144 --> 00:17:26.015
Yanusch Deutsch: I tried to escape but I couldn’t—there were a lot of soldiers.

00:17:26.015 --> 00:17:28.739
David Boder: A vernichtungslager is a destruction lager?

00:17:28.739 --> 00:17:29.343
Yanusch Deutsch: Yes.

00:17:29.343 --> 00:17:30.377
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:17:30.377 --> 00:17:39.168
Yanusch Deutsch: And then they took us in this camp—in this lager and...we saw the women.

00:17:39.168 --> 00:17:39.629
David Boder: What?

00:17:39.629 --> 00:17:40.248
Yanusch Deutsch: The women.

00:17:40.248 --> 00:17:41.231
David Boder: You saw the women...

00:17:41.231 --> 00:18:33.050
Yanusch Deutsch: They had to wait four or five hours because there were other people there. And they had a bath—warm water—and it was very...very good—very...[unintelligible]...we didn’t bathe since two month—nu? And then we had a bath and at six o’clock in the afternoon we came back. The women told us that they had to go first to a big room—where there a thousand women there and they saw big boxes—yellow boxes—which was written: [Unintelligible]. Attention: [unintelligible] and that a...totenkop.

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:33.853
David Boder: Yes.

00:18:33.853 --> 00:18:34.836
Yanusch Deutsch: I don’t know how they say in English.

00:18:34.836 --> 00:18:36.280
David Boder: What is [?]?

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.202
Yanusch Deutsch: A totenkop

00:18:37.202 --> 00:18:38.313
David Boder: A skull?

00:18:38.313 --> 00:18:39.715
Yanusch Deutsch: A skull right on it.

00:18:39.715 --> 00:18:41.820
David Boder: [unintelligible]

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:51.223
Yanusch Deutsch: They didn’t know what it is...they know that...they thought that it’s against them. And then the women, they...

00:18:51.223 --> 00:18:52.789
David Boder: [In German] [unintelligible]

00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:54.095
Yanusch Deutsch: They will annihilate.

00:18:54.095 --> 00:18:54.290
David Boder: Yes.

00:18:54.290 --> 00:19:00.599
Yanusch Deutsch: The women. But it was only the clothes, they disinfected the clothes.

00:19:00.599 --> 00:19:01.109
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:01.109 --> 00:19:02.823
Yanusch Deutsch: And nothing happened.

00:19:02.823 --> 00:19:03.592
David Boder: Well?

00:19:03.592 --> 00:19:08.548
Yanusch Deutsch: Later, we went on and the entire journey took us ten days.

00:19:08.548 --> 00:19:10.846
David Boder: Ten days. All in the same railway car?

00:19:10.846 --> 00:19:12.189
Yanusch Deutsch: The same cars.

00:19:12.189 --> 00:19:12.634
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:12.634 --> 00:19:35.626
Yanusch Deutsch: We arrived in Bergen-Belsen. That is seventy kilometers from Hannover, is Celle, is a small city, and from there we had to walk six kilometers on foot. It is, eh, about eight hundred meters high above several beautiful forests, the environment is very beautiful.

00:19:35.626 --> 00:19:36.265
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:36.265 --> 00:19:42.991
Yanusch Deutsch: A lot of people saw the “[unintelligible]-Lager”, not only Jews, but also prisoners of war from all [nationalities].

00:19:42.991 --> 00:19:44.075
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:44.075 --> 00:19:58.128
Yanusch Deutsch: And then we went into the camp. We got a barrack. The women got a barrack. And the men got half a barrack.

00:19:58.128 --> 00:20:00.546
David Boder: And who was in the other half of the barrack?

00:20:00.546 --> 00:20:06.669
Yanusch Deutsch: That was, was, we could not exactly [unintelligible]. Those were Poles, of, Polish Jews.

00:20:06.669 --> 00:20:07.021

00:20:07.021 --> 00:20:09.884
Yanusch Deutsch: [unintelligible] were with Christian papers.

00:20:09.884 --> 00:20:12.357
David Boder: Oh. [somewhat surprised] Polish Jews with Christian papers.

00:20:12.357 --> 00:20:19.944
Yanusch Deutsch: Christian papers. But the Germans believed that they were Jews, [corrects himself] that they were Christians. But they were Jews, they told us.

00:20:19.944 --> 00:20:21.223
David Boder: Yes. Well?

00:20:21.223 --> 00:20:26.290
Yanusch Deutsch: And, in one barrack there lived one thousand people.

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:28.226
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:28.226 --> 00:20:30.301
Yanusch Deutsch: There were about a hundred and fifty...

00:20:30.301 --> 00:20:33.386
David Boder: [interrupts] How many Polish Jews with Christian papers were there?

00:20:33.386 --> 00:20:36.749
Yanusch Deutsch: Well, there were about two hundred.

00:20:36.749 --> 00:20:38.315
David Boder: And the Germans didn’t know that...

00:20:38.315 --> 00:20:38.769
Yanusch Deutsch: [interrupts] No.

00:20:38.769 --> 00:20:39.204
David Boder: . . . that they were Jews?

00:20:39.204 --> 00:20:45.031
Yanusch Deutsch: Well, yes. Well, I believe there were many [several words unintelligible] in Bergen-Belsen, only I do not know exactly.

00:20:45.031 --> 00:20:46.467
David Boder: [unintelligible]

00:20:46.467 --> 00:20:49.385

00:21:13.499 --> 00:21:13.814
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:13.814 --> 00:21:34.916
Yanusch Deutsch: Were over-about [he probably means “on top of one another”]. At night, it was very cold. It was July, but it was very, very cold. It was North. And days it was very warm. We did not have to work. This was maybe even worse, because the food was much worse than those who were work—

00:21:34.916 --> 00:21:35.518
David Boder: [unintelligible]

00:21:35.518 --> 00:21:40.196

David Boder: I see.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:24.934
Yanusch Deutsch: It was very good, these pieces of meat. We didn’t know what kind of meat, eh, meat this was. Later, I read in an English newspaper that it was human flesh.

00:22:24.934 --> 00:22:25.981
David Boder: [appalled] That it was human flesh?

00:22:25.981 --> 00:22:27.324

00:22:27.324 --> 00:22:28.806

And I also received three hundred grams of bread every day. But these three hundred grams of bread were very small. So, as small as fifty grams are here. It was heavy, it was very heavy, it was not made from wheat.

00:23:15.431 --> 00:23:16.987
David Boder: From what was it made then?

00:23:16.987 --> 00:23:21.631
Yanusch Deutsch: I don’t know. I think in German I cannot say anymore.

00:23:21.631 --> 00:23:22.659
David Boder: Well?

00:23:22.659 --> 00:23:31.525
Yanusch Deutsch: And also sometimes they gave us confiture. Per week, twenty grams of confiture per week.

00:23:31.525 --> 00:23:32.979
David Boder: What kind of confiture?

00:23:32.979 --> 00:23:36.259

Yanusch Deutsch: Yes. And from six, up to the age of six they gave half a liter per day, between six and nine years three deciliters, from nine to fourteen two deciliters of milk.

00:24:30.334 --> 00:24:31.511
David Boder: Did you get any milk?

00:24:31.511 --> 00:24:33.290
Yanusch Deutsch: No, I was more than fourteen years old.

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:34.596

00:24:45.815 --> 00:25:05.416
Yanusch Deutsch: At seven o’clock we had to get up, get up. Hygiene was very good and very big in this camp. Well, the Germans always have been rich people, [corrects himself] clean people, haven’t they? They like cleanliness. We had big show—, showers. We could shower every day. Cold water...

00:25:05.416 --> 00:25:06.555
David Boder: [interrupts] In your block?

00:25:06.555 --> 00:25:52.795
Yanusch Deutsch: Yes, the water, of course, was very pleasant. And we got soap. And the latrines also were very good and clean. And, so at seven o’clock we had to get up. The men at six, and the women at seven. At ten, there was roll call. Every day the soldiers came to count us. If nobody had run away. And after that we had nothing to do until night. Between ten at night and seven in the morning nobody was allowed to leave the barracks. Anybody who went outside was shot. From the tower. All around were, every two hundred meters there were towers with soldiers and guns.

00:25:52.795 --> 00:25:57.743
David Boder: Yes. Did you see the other Jews there? Did you [no verb] the Polish Jews...

00:25:57.743 --> 00:26:03.209

00:26:25.647 --> 00:26:48.268
Yanusch Deutsch: Once every week we had a bath, a shower, we had bath, eh, a warm bath. And the other part of this bathing facility was the crematory. Twice we saw them bring people into the crematory.

00:26:48.268 --> 00:26:49.139
David Boder: Living?

00:26:49.139 --> 00:26:50.371
Yanusch Deutsch: Living people.

00:26:50.371 --> 00:26:50.612
David Boder: Yes.

00:26:50.612 --> 00:26:54.086
Yanusch Deutsch: . . . were brought. They were screaming and crying and everything.

00:26:54.086 --> 00:26:58.598
David Boder: How was that? Tell. When was that? How, why did you see them? Where did they go?

00:26:58.598 --> 00:27:05.444
Yanusch Deutsch: Every week we were, they told us, we went bathing. The moment at which [the rest is inaudible because of loud noises from the recorder]

00:27:05.444 --> 00:27:12.429
David Boder: Well, I wanted to know, again. You say that you saw the people that were brought into the crematory?

00:27:12.429 --> 00:27:12.642
Yanusch Deutsch: Yes.

00:27:12.642 --> 00:27:21.007
David Boder: So, will you tell me such an incident in great detail? Well?

00:27:21.007 --> 00:27:50.600
Yanusch Deutsch: Well, we went to, to the bathing house. Was two big rooms. In one room we had to take off our clothes. And go to, to, into the shower room. And we, we were inside, and we undressed on top [he probably means that they were undressing their upper bodies], when two cars arrived with people, Jewish people, I don’t know what nationality.

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:51.573
David Boder: Yes.

00:27:51.573 --> 00:27:55.640
Yanusch Deutsch: So, they were wearing their stars. I believe they were Dutch.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:55.964
David Boder: Yes.

00:27:55.964 --> 00:28:01.902
Yanusch Deutsch: Were very bad condition, they could barely walk. Were older people there as well.

00:28:01.902 --> 00:28:02.273
David Boder: Yes.

00:28:02.273 --> 00:28:08.193
Yanusch Deutsch: Older people, and, and children, too. Well, strong people I did not see at all.

00:28:08.193 --> 00:28:08.452
David Boder: Yes.

00:28:08.452 --> 00:28:11.726
Yanusch Deutsch: Were only weak and sick people. And then...

00:28:11.726 --> 00:28:13.331
David Boder: Only in this transport, right?

00:28:13.331 --> 00:28:29.949
Yanusch Deutsch: Yes. And then the Germans threw the Jews down off the car. And beat them with truncheons. And they went into, into the other building.

00:28:29.949 --> 00:28:33.407
David Boder: Yes. And you say these people were screaming?

00:28:33.407 --> 00:29:08.204
Yanusch Deutsch: Screaming and crying, and they probably knew what was going to happen. With this probably not. And each week we went bathing in multiple transports because there were sixteen hundred Jews there. And, and in the bathroom only two hundred people could go at a time. Well, we went at three in the afternoon, we only saw at three-thirty. And the others went later. Until nine o’clock at night nobody returned from there. Well, if nobody returns by nine o’clock, they probably are...

00:29:08.204 --> 00:29:10.736
David Boder: Well, you know, maybe they went to a different block?

00:29:10.736 --> 00:29:12.745
Yanusch Deutsch: There was no, no other exit.

00:29:12.745 --> 00:29:13.103
David Boder: I see.

00:29:13.103 --> 00:29:16.175
Yanusch Deutsch: I knew these people very well.

00:29:16.175 --> 00:29:16.432
David Boder: Yes.

00:29:16.432 --> 00:29:20.229
Yanusch Deutsch: We knew each other well. I worked there [unintelligible].

00:29:20.229 --> 00:29:22.595
David Boder: Yes. Where did you work there?

00:29:22.595 --> 00:29:24.099
Yanusch Deutsch: In, in the bathing house.

00:29:24.099 --> 00:29:24.393
David Boder: I see.

00:29:24.393 --> 00:29:48.990
Yanusch Deutsch: Well, I worked in the garden, but not for very long. And what more can I tell from Bergen-Belsen? There were soldiers there, so there were no newspapers and everything to be gotten in there. There were soldiers, some of them were decent. They talked to us.

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:49.733
David Boder: SS-people?

00:29:49.733 --> 00:29:53.888
Yanusch Deutsch: SS-people. Were Hungarians there, for example. They weren’t Nazis.

00:29:53.888 --> 00:29:54.502
David Boder: Yes.

00:29:54.502 --> 00:30:34.283
Yanusch Deutsch: Rather, the Germans depor—, deported them from Hungary and made them soldiers. And they did not want to fight at the front, so they were, eh, made guards at the concentration camp Bergen-Belsen. And they were no Nazis, they helped us. And they always told us the political situation. And we were always delighted [possibly: “we were always asking”?] that the, the, eh, in, in, eh, there was the invasion in France. On June 6, the invasion in France started and that same day we were deported from Hungary.

00:30:34.283 --> 00:30:34.824
David Boder: I see.

00:30:34.824 --> 00:30:55.013
Yanusch Deutsch: Well, it was already August, and we heard what there was, in, in France, in Hungary. And we, they brought in newspapers and cigarettes for us. We had marks, German marks, Reich marks from Hungary still. We gave them the marks...

00:30:55.013 --> 00:30:57.694
David Boder: [interrupts] Were you allowed to keep the marks?

00:30:57.694 --> 00:31:00.488
Yanusch Deutsch: We were not searched at all.

00:31:00.488 --> 00:31:02.093
David Boder: Where? In the camp?

00:31:02.093 --> 00:31:05.074
Yanusch Deutsch: In, from, from, eh, Budapest there we had not been searched.

00:31:05.074 --> 00:31:07.981
David Boder: But didn’t you have to hand in everything in Budapest?

00:31:07.981 --> 00:31:09.898
Yanusch Deutsch: Not in Budapest, in Stuhlweissenburg

00:31:09.898 --> 00:31:11.760
David Boder: But you had to hand it in, didn’t you?

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:16.080
Yanusch Deutsch: Yes, but, but this we received in Budapest in the camp.

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.391
David Boder: [unintelligible]?

00:31:17.391 --> 00:31:18.941
Yanusch Deutsch: Or was from acquaintances.

00:31:18.941 --> 00:31:19.409
David Boder: I see.

00:31:19.409 --> 00:31:25.435
Yanusch Deutsch: This, eh, this camp in Budapest was very good. We could even go out of the camp.

00:31:25.435 --> 00:31:29.480
David Boder: Yes. But wait. First, you were in a camp in your city?

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:30.021
Yanusch Deutsch: Yes.

00:31:30.021 --> 00:31:30.553
David Boder: Then you were...

00:31:30.553 --> 00:31:33.992
Yanusch Deutsch: It was very bad. It was worse than Bergen-Belsen; for three weeks.

00:31:33.992 --> 00:31:35.193
David Boder: Then you were...

00:31:35.193 --> 00:31:45.722
Yanusch Deutsch: In Budapest I was in a camp that was good. We could go outside with a guard and, and guarded, could go inside. The food was enough and much.

00:31:45.722 --> 00:31:46.960
David Boder: Go outside with what?

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.125
Yanusch Deutsch: With, with, eh, German soldier.

00:31:49.125 --> 00:31:49.446
David Boder: I see.

00:31:49.446 --> 00:31:54.554
Yanusch Deutsch: We paid one hundred pengös, one hundred Hungarian pengös, and then we could go outside.

00:31:54.554 --> 00:31:57.618
David Boder: And in Linz?

00:31:57.618 --> 00:32:00.672
Yanusch Deutsch: In Linz we only were one day, we were waiting.

00:32:00.672 --> 00:32:03.350
David Boder: So, where did you have to hand in everything?

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:05.331
Yanusch Deutsch: In, in [unintelligible; could either be “my city,” or a Hungarian place name].

00:32:05.331 --> 00:32:08.614
David Boder: So, how did you have it again Budapest? Oh. From acquaintances [unintelligible].

00:32:08.614 --> 00:32:10.421
Yanusch Deutsch: Yes. Do you understand it?

00:32:10.421 --> 00:32:10.724
David Boder: Yes.

00:32:10.724 --> 00:32:11.595
Yanusch Deutsch: Is it clear?

00:32:11.595 --> 00:32:12.843
David Boder: Yes. Well?

00:32:12.843 --> 00:32:18.979
Yanusch Deutsch: And they forgot about me. I don’t know exactly, I think I had five hundred German marks.

00:32:18.979 --> 00:32:19.392
David Boder: Yes.

00:32:19.392 --> 00:32:28.701
Yanusch Deutsch: The money was not big [he may mean, “it was not much money”], but we could not do anything with it. We gave twenty, thirty marks for a newspaper and, I know not what, cigarettes.

00:32:28.701 --> 00:32:29.682
David Boder: Yes.

00:32:29.682 --> 00:32:35.497
Yanusch Deutsch: And, is very interesting, the Jewish psychologist who [no verb] in the camp.

00:32:35.497 --> 00:32:36.607
David Boder: Yes.

00:32:36.607 --> 00:32:45.090
Yanusch Deutsch: [unintelligible] there were many doctors and advocates and intellectuals, many, eighty percent were intellectuals.

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:46.319
David Boder: [asks back, unintelligible]?

00:32:46.319 --> 00:32:49.116
Yanusch Deutsch: Yes. In this, our transport.

00:32:49.116 --> 00:32:50.033
David Boder: Yes. Well?

00:32:50.033 --> 00:32:52.170
Yanusch Deutsch: Out of Sixteen hundred people.

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:52.546
David Boder: Yes.

00:32:52.546 --> 00:33:02.497
Yanusch Deutsch: And when we came to Bergen-Belsen, the very first day everybody started stealing.

00:33:02.497 --> 00:33:03.477
David Boder: doubtful] Stealing?

00:33:03.477 --> 00:33:10.423
Yanusch Deutsch: Yes. Stealing. I would leave something there, a piece of meat or I don’t know what, and a few minutes later it would not be there anymore.

00:33:10.423 --> 00:33:11.086
David Boder: I see.

00:33:11.086 --> 00:33:20.302
Yanusch Deutsch: And, everybody was stealing. And was, they were all arguing all day long. It was, the nerves fall apart.

00:33:20.302 --> 00:33:21.437

00:33:21.437 --> 00:33:42.285
Yanusch Deutsch: And we were arguing with our friends and, and, and with everybody, the relatives, and we were cursing, all day long. And when the [unintelligible], we were one or two months in Bergen-Belsen.

00:33:42.911 --> 00:33:44.219
Yanusch Deutsch: Two months.

00:33:44.219 --> 00:33:44.537
David Boder: Yes.

00:33:44.537 --> 00:33:49.558
Yanusch Deutsch: Only, well, it was not very much. Then we were given the complaint [meaning unclear]...

00:33:49.558 --> 00:33:52.091
David Boder: Who brought that?

00:33:52.091 --> 00:34:11.185
Yanusch Deutsch: One morning the German soldiers came. We had to move to a different camp. [unintelligible] we were in Dachau or to Auschwitz, another camp. And, again, we went into railway cars. We were only, only three hundred.

00:34:11.185 --> 00:34:13.146
David Boder: Yes. Men and women?

00:34:13.146 --> 00:34:14.581
Yanusch Deutsch: Men and women.

00:34:14.581 --> 00:34:15.711
David Boder: Were your parents there?

00:34:15.711 --> 00:34:47.862
Yanusch Deutsch: Yes. Was with my parents. Thank God was with my parents. And there three hundred remained there. And then we went into the railway cars. Again eighty or ninety in a car, and four or five days we were in there, and we didn’t know where to and, and [unintelligible]. In Karlsruhe we experienced a German bombardment, Karlsruhe was bombarded. It’s a big city and a big train station.

00:34:47.862 --> 00:34:48.750
David Boder: What city?

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:49.684
Yanusch Deutsch: Karlsruhe.

00:34:49.684 --> 00:34:50.677
David Boder: Yes.

00:34:50.677 --> 00:35:00.686
Yanusch Deutsch: Yes. And then we had to go onto a meadow and everybody could leave if they wanted to. Because no guards whatsoever, we were without guards. Without...

00:35:00.686 --> 00:35:01.422
David Boder: Without soldiers?

00:35:01.422 --> 00:35:18.134
Yanusch Deutsch: Without soldiers, yes. We could move away, if we wanted to. I don’t know, we did not want to go away, we didn’t know where to go. For us, it made no difference anymore where we would be going. That same evening we were in Basel.

00:35:18.134 --> 00:35:20.425
David Boder: Yes. In, in Switzerland?

00:35:20.425 --> 00:35:21.181
Yanusch Deutsch: In Switzerland.

00:35:21.181 --> 00:35:23.474
David Boder: How were you taken across the border?

00:35:23.474 --> 00:35:30.966
Yanusch Deutsch: Yes. The last German station is Weil. That is, was roughly one kilometer from Basel, from the German.

00:35:30.966 --> 00:35:31.363
David Boder: Yes.

00:35:31.363 --> 00:35:38.288
Yanusch Deutsch: Still Germany. There we were inspected. They took away all papers that we had.

00:35:38.288 --> 00:35:38.626
David Boder: Yes.

00:35:38.626 --> 00:35:47.603
Yanusch Deutsch: In case somebody had money or something like that, this was not taken away. For example, someone had a, a camera with him. This was not taken away.

00:35:47.603 --> 00:35:51.191
David Boder: Yes. Why did they not take the camera away?

00:35:51.191 --> 00:35:59.718
Yanusch Deutsch: That was not taken. Well, papers were taken away, yes, because they were also afraid of espionage.

00:35:59.718 --> 00:36:01.327
David Boder: Yes.

00:36:01.327 --> 00:36:39.281

00:36:41.965 --> 00:37:01.220
Yanusch Deutsch: Very nice they were. And they led us into a waiting room. There were chairs. There, we saw a chair for the first time after two, after three or four months. And a lamp. And I was afraid to sit in a chair. I just wanted to sit on the earth, on the ground.

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:02.784
David Boder: Yes.

00:37:02.784 --> 00:37:21.315
Yanusch Deutsch: And then we received food. First soup and then lighter things, then later chocolate [several words unintelligible]. Then we slowly, slowly understood that we have come to Switzerland and that we are saved.

00:37:21.315 --> 00:37:22.709
David Boder: Your entire family?

00:37:22.709 --> 00:37:23.712
Yanusch Deutsch: Yes.

00:37:23.712 --> 00:37:26.454
David Boder: And then, what happened in Switzerland?

00:37:26.454 --> 00:37:51.206
Yanusch Deutsch: In Switzerland we were in an “Auffanglager” [refugee camp] in Montreux. Was not very good. In another “Auffanglager” as well. Was for two months, for three months. And then I went to Engelberg, in an asylum. My mother was there, too. Was in an English Institute, was there for one year. In an English Institute.

Yanusch Deutsch: My father is in the Zürich area, working as an engineer.

00:37:57.322 --> 00:38:00.840
David Boder: Yes. So, why can your mother not live with him?

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:06.039
Yanusch Deutsch: Well, my, my father does not earn enough so that my mother can live there, too.

00:38:06.039 --> 00:38:10.476
David Boder: I see. And in Zürich, he is with, with whom?

00:38:10.476 --> 00:38:13.961

David Boder: What do you want to study?

00:39:47.599 --> 00:39:49.786
Yanusch Deutsch: Eh, mechanical engineer.

00:39:49.786 --> 00:39:59.873
David Boder: Mechanical engineer. Well, then you must have fared quite well, that it remains different, quite different from how the other people have fared?

00:39:59.873 --> 00:40:00.304
Yanusch Deutsch: Yes.

00:40:00.304 --> 00:40:04.349
David Boder: How do you explain this? Was that because you were Zionists? Was that because you were Hungarians?

00:40:04.349 --> 00:40:07.818
Yanusch Deutsch: In Hungary, in Hungary we were big Zionists.

00:40:07.818 --> 00:40:09.018
David Boder: Yes.

00:40:09.018 --> 00:40:22.955
Yanusch Deutsch: And the Germans saved the Zionists. So one did, the Jews saw who can, who can come, in these transports. And of course they chose the Zionists. You know?

00:40:22.955 --> 00:40:28.862
David Boder: I see.

00:40:28.862 --> 00:40:32.713
David Boder: Were there many rich people with you or were there poor people, too?

00:40:32.713 --> 00:40:42.490
Yanusch Deutsch: That differed widely. There were very easy, [corrects himself] very rich people who paid a lot so that they could come, in addition there were the Zionists.

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:43.226
David Boder: Yes.

00:40:43.226 --> 00:40:53.293
Yanusch Deutsch: Were a lot, but the majority were poor people, you know? We, for example, paid nothing [several words unintelligible] at all, you know?

00:40:53.293 --> 00:40:56.815
David Boder: Yes. How did you pay?

00:40:56.815 --> 00:41:08.008
Yanusch Deutsch: The Jewish, the Juden—, the Judenrat. The Judenrat gave it to, to the Joint and that, in turn, [unintelligible] made.

00:41:08.008 --> 00:41:11.723
David Boder: The Joint did not make any money out of you, did it?

00:41:11.723 --> 00:41:23.396
Yanusch Deutsch: Well, I don’t know how it came about. I, the Joint paid the money but they had to pay something for it beforehand.

00:41:23.396 --> 00:41:38.717
David Boder: [In English] This concludes Spool 80 of Yanusch Deutsch, a Hungarian, a Hungarian Jewish child which was saved...eh, by special, by a special form of deportation to Belsen, presumably a Zionist, which has to be verified.
