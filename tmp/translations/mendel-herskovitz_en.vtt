00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.121
David Boder: [In German] Mendel, how old are you?

00:01:55.121 --> 00:01:56.475

00:01:56.475 --> 00:02:04.196

00:02:04.196 --> 00:02:05.989
Mendel Herskovitz: In Lodz.

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:06.523
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:06.523 --> 00:02:07.270
Mendel Herskovitz: In Poland.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.134
David Boder: In Poland. In what city?

00:02:09.134 --> 00:02:09.822
Mendel Herskovitz: Lodz.

00:02:09.822 --> 00:02:16.766
David Boder: In Lodz. Tell....How old were you when the Germans came to Lodz?

00:02:16.766 --> 00:02:20.055
Mendel Herskovitz: When the Germans came to Lodz I was twelve years old.

00:02:20.055 --> 00:02:24.077
David Boder: Twelve years. Before the Germans, who was in Lodz?

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:25.659
Mendel Herskovitz: Poland. The Poles.

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.640
David Boder: The Poles. The Russians were not in Lodz?

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.663
Mendel Herskovitz: The Russians were not in Lodz.

00:02:28.663 --> 00:02:32.846
David Boder: All right. And so you were twelve years old when the Germans came to Lodz?

00:02:32.846 --> 00:02:34.156
Mendel Herskovitz: Yes.

00:02:34.156 --> 00:02:59.464
David Boder: All right. Good. Now, would you tell me with the best details, what happened in the few days before the Germans came, and when they came,and all that? Tell me everything the way you remember it. We want later to tell it to the American children. You understand that?

00:02:59.464 --> 00:02:59.974
Mendel Herskovitz: Hm.

00:02:59.974 --> 00:03:34.438
David Boder: And so, begin and speak most frankly. Yes. Now how was it the way you remember the three, four days before the Germans came? What did the Poles do? [Pause. There is some whisper. He apparently talks away from the microphone.]

00:03:34.438 --> 00:03:43.600
David Boder: Not exactly [all] the details. What you remember. Tell.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:50.145
Mendel Herskovitz: A scare fell on the Jews when they found out that the Germans were near Lodz.

00:03:50.145 --> 00:03:51.184
David Boder: Hm.

00:03:51.184 --> 00:04:04.699
Mendel Herskovitz: On a Wednesday night began...people packed and began running farther... nearer to...to be farther away from the Germans.

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:05.147
David Boder: Yes.

00:04:05.147 --> 00:04:09.266
Mendel Herskovitz: That means they ran on the road to Brzeziny that would take them closest to Warsaw.

00:04:09.266 --> 00:04:11.883
David Boder: Yes.

00:04:11.883 --> 00:04:23.755
Mendel Herskovitz: On the way.... I was also among them. I also ran. There arrived German planes, and they saw a crowd of people.

00:04:23.755 --> 00:04:24.523
David Boder: Go on.

00:04:24.523 --> 00:04:34.116
Mendel Herskovitz: They dived down. With machine guns from the planes, they began to shoot [us] up, so that ninety per cent of the people remained lying right there.

00:04:34.116 --> 00:04:34.643
David Boder: Hm.

00:04:34.643 --> 00:04:36.735
Mendel Herskovitz: And only a few came out.

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:43.168
David Boder: Who...who was in your family...family? Your father? Your...

00:04:43.168 --> 00:04:44.349
Mendel Herskovitz: There was...

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:45.037
David Boder: Yes.

00:04:45.037 --> 00:04:50.975
Mendel Herskovitz: The family consisted of daddy, mommie, three sisters, and me.

00:04:50.975 --> 00:04:56.866
David Boder: Yes. And no grandmother, no grandfather? They were not with you?

00:04:56.866 --> 00:04:58.974
Mendel Herskovitz: It is self-understood. We did not live together.

00:04:58.974 --> 00:05:07.450
David Boder: Hm. Speak at [microphone]. Nu? You say that the German planes came and you were shot at.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.877
Mendel Herskovitz: They began to shoot at us with machine guns.

00:05:09.877 --> 00:05:13.118
David Boder: Yes. Did all of your family remain together?

00:05:13.118 --> 00:05:18.161
Mendel Herskovitz: The family remained at home. Only I and a sister ran away together. And we two came back.

00:05:18.161 --> 00:05:22.312
David Boder: Oh, you didn’t run away together with your family?

00:05:22.312 --> 00:05:22.856
Mendel Herskovitz: No.

00:05:22.856 --> 00:05:25.459
David Boder: No? Who ran away? You and your...

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:31.174
Mendel Herskovitz: There ran a lot of people...nearly seventy percent of the population of Lodz...

00:05:31.174 --> 00:05:33.107
David Boder: Yes? So you and your sister...

00:05:33.107 --> 00:05:36.157
Mendel Herskovitz: And we were...we were youngsters...

00:05:36.157 --> 00:05:36.318
David Boder: Yes?

00:05:36.318 --> 00:05:37.612
Mendel Herskovitz: ...so we also ran away [with them].

00:05:37.612 --> 00:05:39.272
David Boder: And the parents remained at home?

00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:41.044
Mendel Herskovitz: The parents remained at home.

00:05:41.044 --> 00:05:43.328
David Boder: Did the parents tell you to run?

00:05:43.328 --> 00:05:48.676
Mendel Herskovitz: They said we should not run...but, it was...it was so that...it was a state of war,...

00:05:48.676 --> 00:05:48.835
David Boder: Yes?

00:05:48.835 --> 00:05:51.135
Mendel Herskovitz: ...so that everybody did the way he understood.

00:05:51.135 --> 00:05:51.639
David Boder: Hm.

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:52.660
Mendel Herskovitz: One didn’t listen to anybody.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:59.224
David Boder: So you and your sister were on the road, nu?

00:05:59.224 --> 00:06:02.457
Mendel Herskovitz: On the road. We two...and we saw the shooting...

00:06:02.457 --> 00:06:02.630
David Boder: Yes?

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.576
Mendel Herskovitz: ...we began to walk back. On the way we met the Germans already.

00:06:05.576 --> 00:06:05.937
David Boder: Yes?

00:06:05.937 --> 00:06:07.820
Mendel Herskovitz: They didn’t especially bother us,

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.179
David Boder: Yes?

00:06:08.179 --> 00:06:09.717
Mendel Herskovitz: because we were still children...

00:06:09.717 --> 00:06:10.119
David Boder: Yes?

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:12.140
Mendel Herskovitz: ...and so we came back home.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.800
David Boder: What did you find at home?

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.148
Mendel Herskovitz: At home everything was still like before.

00:06:17.148 --> 00:06:19.012
David Boder: Yes? Nu?

00:06:19.012 --> 00:06:23.294
Mendel Herskovitz: And further on, nothing special...the first two days they said that the Jews shouldn’t be afraid...

00:06:23.294 --> 00:06:23.720
David Boder: Yes?

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:30.007
Mendel Herskovitz: The Jews won’t be harmed. And later on, after four, five days, then they went to work.

00:06:30.007 --> 00:06:30.435
David Boder: Yes?

00:06:30.435 --> 00:06:47.391
Mendel Herskovitz: I remember they went in...the first thing was...four days after entering Lodz. They went into a cafe on Nowomiejska Street, to a Jew, and from there they took out fourteen Jews and took them behind the town and there they were shot.

00:06:47.391 --> 00:06:48.401
David Boder: Why?

00:06:48.401 --> 00:06:50.734
Mendel Herskovitz: Uh. Because they were Jews.

00:06:50.734 --> 00:07:01.102
David Boder: Hm, nu? Tell me, what was going on in your house...at home. So, you were there? How long did you remain in Lodz?

00:07:01.102 --> 00:07:14.718
Mendel Herskovitz: In Lodz we remained till...on Rosh-Hashana [Jewish New Year] they entered...we remained until Pesach [Jewish Easter] till Pesach in ’39.

00:07:14.718 --> 00:07:15.733
David Boder: Yes, all right.

00:07:15.733 --> 00:07:17.536
Mendel Herskovitz: Till Pesach of thirty-nine.

00:07:17.536 --> 00:07:21.944
David Boder: Yes, nu? Or was it ’40?

00:07:21.944 --> 00:07:23.621
Mendel Herskovitz: Till forty...This...

00:07:23.621 --> 00:07:29.016
David Boder: Yes. Nu, all right. And you remained there till Pesach. What did the family do?

00:07:29.016 --> 00:07:44.792
Mendel Herskovitz: Till Pesach...until then there was still food...we traded a little and for the food we had to get up at three in the morning and stand in line for bread...and other such things...everything was already very hard.

00:07:44.792 --> 00:07:48.905
David Boder: What were your parents’ occupations? What was your father’s trade?

00:07:48.905 --> 00:07:50.509
Mendel Herskovitz: We...we had a store.

00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:50.692
David Boder: What kind?

00:07:50.692 --> 00:07:51.576
Mendel Herskovitz: Dry -goods.

00:07:51.576 --> 00:07:52.459
David Boder: A dry - goods store?

00:07:52.459 --> 00:07:53.343
Mendel Herskovitz: Dry - goods.

00:07:53.343 --> 00:07:56.159
David Boder: Did you also keep it later on? Was it...?

00:07:56.159 --> 00:08:00.782
Mendel Herskovitz: Later on we didn’t have it any more, but what...? We were able just in time to take out some of the merchandise and hide it in the house...

00:08:00.782 --> 00:08:00.934
David Boder: Yes?

00:08:00.934 --> 00:08:02.619
Mendel Herskovitz: ...and with it we traded later.

00:08:02.619 --> 00:08:04.290
David Boder: Hm, and with it you traded.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:04.900
Mendel Herskovitz: Later on, yes.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.978
David Boder: Yes. Were you sent to work, or what?

00:08:07.978 --> 00:08:13.842
Mendel Herskovitz: We were...on the streets. The Germans drove around like normal, [sarcastically] like only the Germans could...

00:08:13.842 --> 00:08:14.354
David Boder: Yes?

00:08:14.354 --> 00:08:18.633
Mendel Herskovitz: They drove around and caught people...Jews, to work, especially Jews.

00:08:18.633 --> 00:08:24.664
David Boder: Hm. Who from your family was made to work? From your family? You had no brothers?

00:08:24.664 --> 00:08:26.637
Mendel Herskovitz: I too worked a few months.

00:08:26.637 --> 00:08:27.991
David Boder: Yes. And the...

00:08:27.991 --> 00:08:28.708
Mendel Herskovitz: I was only a young child then.

00:08:28.708 --> 00:08:29.895
David Boder: ...sisters? How old were your sisters?

00:08:29.895 --> 00:08:31.523
Mendel Herskovitz: The sisters were younger than I.

00:08:31.523 --> 00:08:32.507
David Boder: Oh, you were the...

00:08:32.507 --> 00:08:33.405
Mendel Herskovitz: I was the oldest.

00:08:33.405 --> 00:08:35.462
David Boder: With which sister did you run away?

00:08:35.462 --> 00:08:38.209
Mendel Herskovitz: With the...with the one younger than I. She was eleven years old.

00:08:38.209 --> 00:08:40.113
David Boder: How old? Eleven?

00:08:40.113 --> 00:08:40.831
Mendel Herskovitz: Yes.

00:08:40.831 --> 00:08:46.310
David Boder: Nu, that’s how it was till Pesach. Now, go on.

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:50.823
Mendel Herskovitz: Later on we were...three weeks before Pesach...

00:08:50.823 --> 00:08:51.706
David Boder: Yes?

00:08:51.706 --> 00:09:12.136
Mendel Herskovitz: ...the Jews were notified that the...there was a part of Lodz that was called Balut [this was the slum] ... hm... that all the Jews had to live together in one quarter. It was called, naturally, a Ghetto.

00:09:12.136 --> 00:09:14.678
David Boder: Yes, nu?

00:09:14.678 --> 00:09:19.431
Mendel Herskovitz: It was to have been that the Ghetto was not to be closed. There will be nearly free movement...

00:09:19.431 --> 00:09:20.838
David Boder: Yes?

00:09:20.838 --> 00:09:30.729
Mendel Herskovitz: ...but on the first...on the second day of Pesach, in the last days, we arose in the morning. we saw that the Ghetto was fenced in.

00:09:30.729 --> 00:09:31.741
David Boder: Fenced in?

00:09:31.741 --> 00:09:32.181
Mendel Herskovitz: Yes.

00:09:32.181 --> 00:09:33.016
David Boder: With what?

00:09:33.016 --> 00:09:34.521
Mendel Herskovitz: It was fenced in with wires...

00:09:34.521 --> 00:09:34.674
David Boder: Hm.

00:09:34.674 --> 00:09:36.260
Mendel Herskovitz: ...with electric wires. [He often whispers, especially the correction.]

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:37.190
David Boder: With electric wires?

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.362
Mendel Herskovitz: No, not with electric wires.

00:09:39.362 --> 00:09:43.789
David Boder: Nu, not with electric wires. With [plain] wires. Nu? So?

00:09:43.789 --> 00:09:48.421
Mendel Herskovitz: And German soldiers already stood around. It was already guarded.

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.311
David Boder: Yes?

00:09:50.311 --> 00:09:50.434
Mendel Herskovitz: Then [?]...

00:09:50.434 --> 00:09:55.202
David Boder: And they were not.... Nu? What were people doing while they were in the Ghetto?

00:09:55.202 --> 00:09:55.817
Mendel Herskovitz: What?

00:09:55.817 --> 00:09:57.772
David Boder: What did the people do in the Ghetto?

00:09:57.772 --> 00:10:08.223
Mendel Herskovitz: They.... What did they do? They indeed did not know what to do. They became...they became not human [they ceased to be human]. They did not know what to do with themselves.

00:10:08.223 --> 00:10:11.270
David Boder: Hm. Were people not taken to work from the Ghetto?

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:12.295
Mendel Herskovitz: Not from the Ghetto.

00:10:12.295 --> 00:10:14.741
David Boder: Louder. From the Ghetto people were not taken.

00:10:14.741 --> 00:10:23.238
Mendel Herskovitz: From the Ghetto not too many people were taken. I there was...if there was a certain trade...if they needed people with a certain trade.... They were the rag pedlers.

00:10:23.238 --> 00:10:23.771
David Boder: What?

00:10:23.771 --> 00:10:25.808

00:10:28.747 --> 00:10:30.648
David Boder: Yes.

00:10:30.648 --> 00:10:32.794
Mendel Herskovitz: They were special Jews who knew...

00:10:32.794 --> 00:10:34.120
David Boder: Oh. Sellers of refuse. Yes?

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:34.489
Mendel Herskovitz: Yes.

00:10:34.489 --> 00:10:35.365
David Boder: Nu? What was...

00:10:35.365 --> 00:10:39.218

00:10:39.218 --> 00:10:39.560
David Boder: Yes?

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.597
Mendel Herskovitz: They were ‘special’ specialists.

00:10:41.597 --> 00:10:42.213
David Boder: Well.

00:10:42.213 --> 00:10:46.462
Mendel Herskovitz: So that they were taken out of the Ghetto, and they lived outside the Ghetto.

00:10:46.462 --> 00:10:46.940
David Boder: Yes?

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.345
Mendel Herskovitz: They lived [outside] for a long time, for a year, a year and a half.

00:10:49.345 --> 00:10:51.108
David Boder: What were they needed for?

00:10:51.108 --> 00:10:52.447
Mendel Herskovitz: Because they were specialists in that they had a knowledge of it.

00:10:52.447 --> 00:10:53.379
David Boder: Specialists in what?

00:10:53.379 --> 00:10:54.582
Mendel Herskovitz: Yes. In that trade.

00:10:54.582 --> 00:10:55.403
David Boder: In what? In rags?

00:10:55.403 --> 00:10:56.893
Mendel Herskovitz: In rags, yes.

00:10:56.893 --> 00:10:59.380
David Boder: Nu, from where did they get so many rags?

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.388
Mendel Herskovitz: Was there not enough of it?

00:11:01.388 --> 00:11:01.663
David Boder: What?

00:11:01.663 --> 00:11:07.797
Mendel Herskovitz: Things that the Jews were wearing before they came to Lodz. Was there not enough of it. Did they not have what to do with it?

00:11:07.797 --> 00:11:09.326
David Boder: What was made of the rags?

00:11:09.326 --> 00:11:13.208
Mendel Herskovitz: The rags were taken into a factory and there new material [goods] was made out of them.

00:11:13.208 --> 00:11:19.524
David Boder: Oh. Nu, let us go on. And how long were you in the Ghetto of Lodz?

00:11:19.524 --> 00:11:27.254
Mendel Herskovitz: In the Ghetto of Lodz I was...I myself was till the year forty-three[?]. In the meantime there were goings on. There was a president Rumkowski.

00:11:27.254 --> 00:11:27.837

00:18:31.818 --> 00:18:32.181
Mendel Herskovitz: Yes.

00:18:32.181 --> 00:18:33.206
David Boder: Yes, nu.

00:18:33.206 --> 00:18:39.246
Mendel Herskovitz: And if it happened that maybe someone...that a worker...that it happened to him that he broke something...

00:18:39.246 --> 00:18:39.463
David Boder: Hm.

00:18:39.463 --> 00:18:42.656
Mendel Herskovitz: ...a thing that had to worked on for a half a day...

00:18:42.656 --> 00:18:43.417
David Boder: Yes?

00:18:43.417 --> 00:18:44.971
Mendel Herskovitz: ...or maybe a few hours...

00:18:44.971 --> 00:18:45.730
David Boder: Yes?

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:47.105
Mendel Herskovitz: ...until it was fixed...

00:18:47.105 --> 00:18:47.983
David Boder: Hm.

00:18:47.983 --> 00:18:56.342
Mendel Herskovitz: There was upstairs a...there was a special office...there was a special entrance on the side to walk up to the first [second in story in the United States] floor... and one was taken upstairs...Two Germans walked upstairs,...

00:18:56.342 --> 00:18:58.121
David Boder: Hm.

00:18:58.121 --> 00:19:01.440
Mendel Herskovitz: ...and that person...he was stretched out on a bench...

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.546
David Boder: Hm.

00:19:02.546 --> 00:19:05.388
Mendel Herskovitz: ...and he was administered...it depended...twenty-five...hundred...

00:19:05.388 --> 00:19:06.418
David Boder: Hm.

00:19:06.418 --> 00:19:08.772
Mendel Herskovitz: One did withstand it, and another did not withstand it.

00:19:08.772 --> 00:19:10.366
David Boder: What means ‘he didn’t withstand it’?

00:19:10.366 --> 00:19:16.103
Mendel Herskovitz: He could get sick and he could...die from it.

00:19:16.103 --> 00:19:16.917
David Boder: Hm. [an interrupted word].

00:19:16.917 --> 00:19:19.846
Mendel Herskovitz: And one did withstand it...It went by...One it didn’t hurt...

00:19:19.846 --> 00:19:20.346
David Boder: Hm.

00:19:20.346 --> 00:19:20.900
Mendel Herskovitz: ...especially...

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:21.778
David Boder: Hm.

00:19:21.778 --> 00:19:25.748
Mendel Herskovitz: ...and another was laid up sick for a few days...and later got up from bed and again went to work.

00:19:25.748 --> 00:19:31.909
David Boder: Hm. Nu...If somebody became sick, what was done...if somebody became sick?

00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:33.385
Mendel Herskovitz: There was a hospital.

00:19:33.385 --> 00:19:34.481
David Boder: What kind of hospital?

00:19:34.481 --> 00:19:36.857
Mendel Herskovitz: There was a hospital. There was medical care...

00:19:36.857 --> 00:19:37.975
David Boder: Hm.

00:19:37.975 --> 00:19:40.839
Mendel Herskovitz: ...that...There were Jewish doctors...

00:19:40.839 --> 00:19:46.707
David Boder: Hm. Nu, and so, that was where? In Czesto...on Czestochowa?

00:19:46.707 --> 00:19:47.576
Mendel Herskovitz: That was in Czestochowa.

00:19:47.576 --> 00:19:51.785
David Boder: In Czestochowa. How long were you in Czestochowa?

00:19:51.785 --> 00:20:00.682
Mendel Herskovitz: In Czestochowa I was...maybe...four or five months. Later I was sent to Skarzysko, as I told you.

00:20:00.682 --> 00:20:02.722
David Boder: Nu, later you were sent where, to...?

00:20:02.722 --> 00:20:06.063
Mendel Herskovitz: To Skarzysko for...for nine weeks.

00:20:06.063 --> 00:20:06.650
David Boder: Nine weeks.

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:08.983
Mendel Herskovitz: To learn working on a new machine.

00:20:08.983 --> 00:20:11.272
David Boder: Oh, you were taught to work on a new machine.

00:20:11.272 --> 00:20:12.476
Mendel Herskovitz: On a new machine.

00:20:12.476 --> 00:20:16.891
David Boder: And who taught you that?

00:20:16.891 --> 00:20:25.112
Mendel Herskovitz: They were old workers, Jewish, who already had worked on that machine. So we were put on that machine and they were only to instruct [?] us.

00:20:25.112 --> 00:20:26.046
David Boder: Hm.

00:20:26.046 --> 00:20:31.545
Mendel Herskovitz: So that we became more familiar with the machine, and we had special [people] who told us how the machine works...

00:20:31.545 --> 00:20:32.283
David Boder: Hm.

00:20:32.283 --> 00:20:34.062
Mendel Herskovitz: ...how we are spposed to operate it.

00:20:34.062 --> 00:20:35.993
David Boder: In what language did they speak to you?

00:20:35.993 --> 00:20:37.501
Mendel Herskovitz: To us one spoke German.

00:20:37.501 --> 00:20:38.294
David Boder: German.

00:20:38.294 --> 00:20:40.692
Mendel Herskovitz: There were Poles, we worked together with Poles...

00:20:40.692 --> 00:20:40.942
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:40.942 --> 00:20:42.252
Mendel Herskovitz: ...and they were, of course, free.

00:20:42.252 --> 00:20:42.801
David Boder: Hm.

00:20:42.801 --> 00:20:44.734
Mendel Herskovitz: With them, of course, Polish was spoken.

00:20:44.734 --> 00:20:48.030
David Boder: Did one live in the same barracks with the Poles?

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:50.532
Mendel Herskovitz: No. They lived in the town.

00:20:50.532 --> 00:20:51.177
David Boder: In what:

00:20:51.177 --> 00:20:53.765
Mendel Herskovitz: In the town. They lived at home.

00:20:53.765 --> 00:20:54.302
David Boder: At home.

00:20:54.302 --> 00:20:55.880
Mendel Herskovitz: And we lived in the lager.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:00.151
David Boder: In the lager. And how did the Poles behave themselves towards the Jews?

00:21:00.151 --> 00:21:02.492
Mendel Herskovitz: This already depended on the person.

00:21:02.492 --> 00:21:03.416
David Boder: Hm. Nu, all right.

00:21:03.416 --> 00:21:11.551
Mendel Herskovitz: But especially good, no. If they could...if they could betray a Jew so that he should fall into a German hand, they did it gladly.

00:21:11.551 --> 00:21:12.380
David Boder: He should what?

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.686
Mendel Herskovitz: He should fall into a German hand.

00:21:14.686 --> 00:21:15.537
David Boder: What does it mean?

00:21:15.537 --> 00:21:16.356
Mendel Herskovitz: To a German!

00:21:16.356 --> 00:21:16.761
David Boder: Hm.

00:21:16.761 --> 00:21:18.773
Mendel Herskovitz: If they could snitch [squeal] on him they did it gladly.

00:21:18.773 --> 00:21:19.230
David Boder: Nu.

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:25.940
Mendel Herskovitz: Like there have been cases that for a kilo of sugar a Jew was sold. A Jew came to hide himself to a Pole.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:26.324
David Boder: Yes?

00:21:26.324 --> 00:21:43.219
Mendel Herskovitz: So the Pole first of all would take away from him all his valuables that he had. When he saw that the Jew doesn’t have anything more, he would go to the Gestapo, would report that a Jew is hiding out with him, and the Jew was taken out and shot. The Poles received for it either a kilo...a liter of schnapps or a kilo of sugar.

00:21:43.219 --> 00:21:51.138
David Boder: A kilo of sugar. Yes. All right. Nu, after the nine weeks there, what happened?

00:21:51.138 --> 00:21:57.654
Mendel Herskovitz: After eight, nine weeks....In the meantime, in a lager, naturally, if there were or weren’t radios...

00:21:57.654 --> 00:21:58.557
David Boder: Yes?

00:21:58.557 --> 00:22:01.066
Mendel Herskovitz: ...we heard the way the political facts are coming along.

00:22:01.066 --> 00:22:02.193
David Boder: Yes?

00:22:02.193 --> 00:22:08.018
Mendel Herskovitz: We also heard that the Russians are beginning to approach, and on the other side the Americans and the English are moving forward.

00:22:08.018 --> 00:22:10.888
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:10.888 --> 00:22:16.915
Mendel Herskovitz: And three weeks before the liquidation of the camp of Skarzysko...

00:22:16.915 --> 00:22:17.712
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:17.712 --> 00:22:20.179
Mendel Herskovitz: ...we were sent back to Czestochowa...

00:22:20.179 --> 00:22:21.827
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:21.827 --> 00:22:25.858
Mendel Herskovitz: ...and here we began to work on those machines that we had learned there.

00:22:25.858 --> 00:22:26.333
David Boder: Yes?

00:22:26.333 --> 00:22:33.121
Mendel Herskovitz: And so passed three weeks. After three weeks we heard that the Russians are near Warsaw...

00:22:33.121 --> 00:22:34.606
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:34.606 --> 00:22:40.678
Mendel Herskovitz: ...and a day later the camp was liquidated in Czestochowa...in...pardon, in Skarzysko,...

00:22:40.678 --> 00:22:42.447
David Boder: What does it mean, ‘the camp was liquidated’?

00:22:42.447 --> 00:22:45.068
Mendel Herskovitz: The camp was evacuated. We were sent [away].

00:22:45.068 --> 00:22:45.711
David Boder: Yes?

00:22:45.711 --> 00:22:50.415
Mendel Herskovitz: There came...three thousand people were sent to Czestochowa.

00:22:50.415 --> 00:22:51.310
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:55.509
Mendel Herskovitz: Among them were small children. There were forty children.

00:22:55.509 --> 00:22:56.435
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:56.435 --> 00:23:07.815
Mendel Herskovitz: They were in the first transport that was brought from Skarzysko to Czestochowa. The forty children were taken away. Till twelve years [old] they were taken away and brought out of the Jewish...on the Jewish cemetary...

00:23:07.815 --> 00:23:08.658
David Boder: Hm.

00:23:08.658 --> 00:23:10.195
Mendel Herskovitz: ...and the children were slain.

00:23:10.195 --> 00:23:11.058
David Boder: Who? [By whom?]

00:23:11.058 --> 00:23:11.489
Mendel Herskovitz: The Germans.

00:23:11.489 --> 00:23:13.141
David Boder: Hm.

00:23:13.141 --> 00:23:21.247
Mendel Herskovitz: After this was a second transport, so the Jews of Czestochowa had especially...uh...eh...had money...

00:23:21.247 --> 00:23:23.047
David Boder: Hm.

00:23:23.047 --> 00:23:27.976
Mendel Herskovitz: ...so that the second transport was of those who had more money...

00:23:27.976 --> 00:23:28.612
David Boder: Hm.

00:23:28.612 --> 00:23:30.486
Mendel Herskovitz: ...and they bribed the Germans...

00:23:30.486 --> 00:23:31.353
David Boder: Hm.

00:23:31.353 --> 00:23:34.284
Mendel Herskovitz: ...and the Jews were...and the children were let into the lager.

00:23:34.284 --> 00:23:35.062
David Boder: The people were let in...

00:23:35.062 --> 00:23:40.702
Mendel Herskovitz: The children were let into the camp, so, that one can say, the children have remained to this day. The children were liberated.

00:23:40.702 --> 00:23:44.111
David Boder: Hm.

00:23:44.111 --> 00:24:06.437
Mendel Herskovitz: This lasted till the time...till two, three months later. When the Russians began to go forward, a list was made of nine hundred...from nine to ten hundred people, Jews, and they were supposed to be sent to Czesto...to Buchenwald, among whom I was also.

00:24:06.437 --> 00:24:07.852
David Boder: Hm.

00:24:07.852 --> 00:24:12.710
Mendel Herskovitz: Suddenly on one morning there was an appell. The nine hundred people were selected...

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:15.026
David Boder: And why to Buchenwald?

00:24:15.026 --> 00:24:17.365
Mendel Herskovitz: Because there was a concentration camp. [He means apparently a distribution center.]

00:24:17.365 --> 00:24:19.561
David Boder: Hm. And the remaining? The nine hundred were...

00:24:19.561 --> 00:24:21.022
Mendel Herskovitz: They remained.

00:24:21.022 --> 00:24:21.324
David Boder: Hm.

00:24:21.324 --> 00:24:23.326
Mendel Herskovitz: I’ll soon tell you what happened to them.

00:24:23.326 --> 00:24:24.596
David Boder: Yes.

00:24:24.596 --> 00:24:32.326
Mendel Herskovitz: We were taken outside the city, put on trains, and driven four days in succession.

00:24:32.326 --> 00:24:34.710
David Boder: Hm.

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:38.144
Mendel Herskovitz: So we were driven till we arrived in Buchenwald.

00:24:38.144 --> 00:24:39.764
David Boder: Hm.

00:24:39.764 --> 00:24:45.075
Mendel Herskovitz: In Buchenwald we were stripped or everything that we had. Everybody already had...we had traded with the Poles.

00:24:45.075 --> 00:24:45.441
David Boder: Hm.

00:24:45.441 --> 00:24:46.743
Mendel Herskovitz: So everybody already had something.

00:24:46.743 --> 00:24:47.090
David Boder: Hm.

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:49.553
Mendel Herskovitz: One had bread. One had...eh...

00:24:49.553 --> 00:24:49.935
David Boder: Hm.

00:24:49.935 --> 00:24:52.971
Mendel Herskovitz: ...eh...eh...one can say even dollars.

00:24:52.971 --> 00:24:53.286
David Boder: Yes.

00:24:53.286 --> 00:24:55.495
Mendel Herskovitz: Another had gold. How one already...

00:24:55.495 --> 00:24:55.765
David Boder: Yes.

00:24:55.765 --> 00:25:04.997
Mendel Herskovitz: ...had worked himself up a little. All this we had taken away. We were given prison clothes.

00:25:04.997 --> 00:25:05.634
David Boder: Hm.

00:25:05.634 --> 00:25:08.819
Mendel Herskovitz: That meant jackets and pants, blue and white stripes.

00:25:08.819 --> 00:25:11.413
David Boder: Hm.

00:25:11.413 --> 00:25:15.929
Mendel Herskovitz: And we were distributed to barracks. We lived thre, two thousand, three thousand men in one block.

00:25:15.929 --> 00:25:16.324
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:16.324 --> 00:25:16.556
Mendel Herskovitz: So...

00:25:16.556 --> 00:25:18.048
David Boder: Only Jews?

00:25:18.048 --> 00:25:20.451
Mendel Herskovitz: Only Jews. This transport was of Jews only.

00:25:20.451 --> 00:25:22.615
David Boder: Hm. Nu?

00:25:22.615 --> 00:25:27.404
Mendel Herskovitz: The treatment was...let’s imagine, a very bad one.

00:25:27.404 --> 00:25:30.327
David Boder: Why? I mean, how come?

00:25:30.327 --> 00:25:32.143
Mendel Herskovitz: We didn’t receive anything to cover ourselves.

00:25:32.143 --> 00:25:32.427
David Boder: Yes?

00:25:32.427 --> 00:25:34.400
Mendel Herskovitz: We had to sleep in our clothes.

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.102
David Boder: Hm.

00:25:35.102 --> 00:25:41.185
Mendel Herskovitz: The soup that we received was water. Plain water [in cmparison] is thick.

00:25:41.185 --> 00:25:44.107
David Boder: Hm. Nu?

00:25:44.107 --> 00:25:48.830
Mendel Herskovitz: Furthermore, the bread that we received had more [potato] peels than flour...

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:49.071
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:49.071 --> 00:25:54.682
Mendel Herskovitz: ...like sawdust. One couldn’t call it flour.

00:25:54.682 --> 00:25:55.209
David Boder: Did one...

00:25:55.209 --> 00:26:02.939
Mendel Herskovitz: Furthermore, we slept...at night we slept fifteen men on two meters, one two meters in width we slept fift-...

00:26:02.939 --> 00:26:03.841
David Boder: On two meters in width...

00:26:03.841 --> 00:26:07.089
Mendel Herskovitz: ...on two meters in width. That was boards knocked together...

00:26:07.089 --> 00:26:07.272
David Boder: Hm.

00:26:07.272 --> 00:26:08.744
Mendel Herskovitz: ...over four stories in height...

00:26:08.744 --> 00:26:10.864
David Boder: Hm.

00:26:10.864 --> 00:26:12.723
Mendel Herskovitz: ...fifteen men slept.

00:26:12.723 --> 00:26:13.909
David Boder: On every two meters?

00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:16.111
Mendel Herskovitz: On every two meters fifteen men.

00:26:16.111 --> 00:26:17.211
David Boder: Nu, how can one sleep like this?

00:26:17.211 --> 00:26:20.359
Mendel Herskovitz: This way we had to sleep. How one can, I know...

00:26:20.359 --> 00:26:20.600
David Boder: Yes?

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:24.263
Mendel Herskovitz: ...that no man can understand it who didn’t go through all this...

00:26:24.263 --> 00:26:24.850
David Boder: Hm.

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:31.349
Mendel Herskovitz: ...who didn’t see it, but like this we had to sleep. It acturally was impossible, but in the winter it was warmer because of it.

00:26:31.349 --> 00:26:31.962
David Boder: Hm.

00:26:31.962 --> 00:26:39.993
Mendel Herskovitz: Heat was not provided. There were barracks that were, maybe fifty, sixty, meters in length and thirty meters in width.

00:26:39.993 --> 00:26:42.783
David Boder: In which month did you go to Buchenwald?

00:26:42.783 --> 00:26:46.203
Mendel Herskovitz: I came to Buchenwald the first month of ’45.

00:26:46.203 --> 00:26:47.002
David Boder: January?

00:26:47.002 --> 00:26:48.119
Mendel Herskovitz: January.

00:26:48.119 --> 00:26:53.346
David Boder: Hm. Nu, and then? Did one work in Buchenwald?

00:26:53.346 --> 00:27:01.534
Mendel Herskovitz: In the beginning we were four weeks in quarantine. That meant, four weeks we had to be in the block whether one isn’t sick...

00:27:01.534 --> 00:27:02.866
David Boder: Hm.

00:27:02.866 --> 00:27:06.155
Mendel Herskovitz: ...whether one isn’t sick of a cont-...contagious...

00:27:06.155 --> 00:27:06.295
David Boder: Yes?

00:27:06.295 --> 00:27:09.586
Mendel Herskovitz: ...disease, and later on one began to be sent to work.

00:27:09.586 --> 00:27:10.328
David Boder: What did one do?

00:27:10.328 --> 00:27:11.385
Mendel Herskovitz: And in those four weeks...

00:27:11.385 --> 00:27:11.926
David Boder: Hm.

00:27:11.926 --> 00:27:16.076
Mendel Herskovitz: In the meantime injections [word given in Polish] were given.

00:27:16.076 --> 00:27:16.259
David Boder: Nu?

00:27:16.259 --> 00:27:19.192
Mendel Herskovitz: Injections. What is it called in English or Jewish?

00:27:19.192 --> 00:27:20.521
David Boder: What do you call it?

00:27:20.521 --> 00:27:21.463
Mendel Herskovitz: I do not know what it is in English.

00:27:21.463 --> 00:27:23.199
David Boder: What is it called [attempts to repeat in Polish]?

00:27:23.199 --> 00:27:26.876
Mendel Herskovitz: [In Polish] Injections. Nu, that doctors make against...against various didseases.

00:27:26.876 --> 00:27:28.537
David Boder: Injections. [In English]

00:27:28.537 --> 00:27:28.537
Mendel Herskovitz: Injections...

00:27:28.537 --> 00:27:29.884
David Boder: Injections. [In German]

00:27:29.884 --> 00:27:30.597
Mendel Herskovitz: Injections. [In German]

00:27:30.597 --> 00:27:31.900
David Boder: Injections. [In German, the right word]

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.561
Mendel Herskovitz: Injections. That’s it.

00:27:33.561 --> 00:27:35.549
David Boder: Hm. They were given to you, yes.

00:27:35.549 --> 00:27:40.510
Mendel Herskovitz: One was given eight injections against all the diseases that can...that...

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:40.902
David Boder: Yes?

00:27:40.902 --> 00:27:42.116
Mendel Herskovitz: ...that can be contagious...

00:27:42.116 --> 00:27:42.202
David Boder: Yes.

00:27:42.202 --> 00:27:44.891
Mendel Herskovitz: ...that a man can easily catch...

00:27:44.891 --> 00:27:45.020
David Boder: Hm.

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:47.111
Mendel Herskovitz: ...in such...under susch filthy conditions in which we lived there.

00:27:47.111 --> 00:27:49.631
David Boder: Hm. And then?

00:27:49.631 --> 00:28:06.320
Mendel Herskovitz: After four weeks....So we lived for four weeks. After four weeks we began to be distributed to work. There was...in the beginning we...we have... we were sent...we carried bricks to build a...a...against a bombardment to hide oneself.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:06.650
David Boder: Eh...

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:06.833
Mendel Herskovitz: What was it called?

00:28:06.833 --> 00:28:08.162
David Boder: A bomb-shelter. A...

00:28:08.162 --> 00:28:08.703
Mendel Herskovitz: A bomb-shelter.

00:28:08.703 --> 00:28:17.765
David Boder: Against bombs...to....Yes? I understand. And then?

00:28:17.765 --> 00:28:21.686
Mendel Herskovitz: Later, Russians planes have....I remember, on a Friday...

00:28:21.686 --> 00:28:23.373
David Boder: Hm.

00:28:23.373 --> 00:28:35.191
Mendel Herskovitz: ...Russian planes have bombed the first city near Buchenwald. It was eight kilometers from Buchenwald. They have bombed the...in the span of six hours...

00:28:35.191 --> 00:28:36.384
David Boder: Hm.

00:28:36.384 --> 00:28:39.904
Mendel Herskovitz: ...so that....The city was named Weimar.

00:28:39.904 --> 00:28:40.660
David Boder: Yes.

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:52.925
Mendel Herskovitz: They bombed during the span of six hours so, that maybe three-quarters of the city was damaged.

00:28:52.925 --> 00:28:53.672
David Boder: Hm.

00:28:53.672 --> 00:28:55.481
Mendel Herskovitz: Saturday morning we were put on trains...

00:28:55.481 --> 00:28:56.156
David Boder: Hm.

00:28:56.156 --> 00:29:04.560
Mendel Herskovitz: ...and we were driven to this city, to work at the houses there that had been bombed. Naturally a lot of people had been killed.

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.395
David Boder: Hm.

00:29:05.395 --> 00:29:07.675
Mendel Herskovitz: ...and later to carry out the things [belongings] that still could be repaired.

00:29:07.675 --> 00:29:10.594
David Boder: Were you allowed to take the things which you found?

00:29:10.594 --> 00:29:13.460
Mendel Herskovitz: Not for us to keep. To take them out for the Germans.

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.136
David Boder: Hm.

00:29:15.136 --> 00:29:33.186
Mendel Herskovitz: Because we...we weren’t allowed to touch anything. One could help himself...if there was, let’s say, a bombed house. If one can find food or other things, one took it...If one could take it with him, he took it with him. If not, he ate it on the spot, so that we made out a little.

00:29:33.186 --> 00:29:35.554
David Boder: Did one find any money, or such?

00:29:35.554 --> 00:29:39.748
Mendel Herskovitz: Money had absolutely no interest for us, because we couldn”t get anything for the money.

00:29:39.748 --> 00:29:40.624
David Boder: One couldn’t get anything?

00:29:40.624 --> 00:29:41.038
Mendel Herskovitz: We couldn’t...

00:29:41.038 --> 00:29:41.239
David Boder: And yet...

00:29:41.239 --> 00:29:41.736
Mendel Herskovitz: ...get anything for the money.

00:29:41.736 --> 00:29:43.873
David Boder: There was money in the lager.

00:29:43.873 --> 00:29:46.947
Mendel Herskovitz: [In the] later it was different. There was special canteen money...

00:29:46.947 --> 00:29:47.645
David Boder: Nu, and what...

00:29:47.645 --> 00:29:51.680
Mendel Herskovitz: ...for which we received...which we received two marks a week...

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:52.452
David Boder: Yes?

00:29:52.452 --> 00:29:54.867
Mendel Herskovitz: ...and for this one could get one [bowl of] soup...

00:29:54.867 --> 00:29:55.699
David Boder: Yes?

00:29:55.699 --> 00:29:56.903
Mendel Herskovitz: ...with a liter of beer.

00:29:56.903 --> 00:29:57.943
David Boder: What is that?

00:29:57.943 --> 00:29:58.923
Mendel Herskovitz: A liter of beer.

00:29:58.923 --> 00:30:00.267
David Boder: A little beer?

00:30:00.267 --> 00:30:01.151
Mendel Herskovitz: A liter...

00:30:01.151 --> 00:30:01.951
David Boder: A liter beer.

00:30:01.951 --> 00:30:02.563
Mendel Herskovitz: Beer.

00:30:02.563 --> 00:30:03.139
David Boder: Hm.

00:30:03.139 --> 00:30:04.135
Mendel Herskovitz: That was all...

00:30:04.135 --> 00:30:04.514
David Boder: And what... [interrupted]

00:30:04.514 --> 00:30:06.454
Mendel Herskovitz: ...we could get. This we could get on Sunday.

00:30:06.454 --> 00:30:06.908
David Boder: Eh... [interrupted]

00:30:06.908 --> 00:30:09.503
Mendel Herskovitz: Further, money did not interest us any.

00:30:09.503 --> 00:30:10.050
David Boder: Hm.

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:16.631
Mendel Herskovitz: Yes, gold or dollars did interest us, because among us we traded. And there were those who traded with the Germans.

00:30:16.631 --> 00:30:19.438
David Boder: There were prisoners who traded... [interrupted]

00:30:19.438 --> 00:30:23.012
Mendel Herskovitz: Prisoners...of us who traded with the Germans of...with the SS.

00:30:23.012 --> 00:30:25.607
David Boder: Wasn’t it dangerous, the SS?

00:30:25.607 --> 00:30:31.426
Mendel Herskovitz: It was dangerous, but, if they needed anything, they became ‘out of danger.’

00:30:31.426 --> 00:30:32.567
David Boder: Hm. When the SS... [interrupted]

00:30:32.567 --> 00:30:35.536
Mendel Herskovitz: If it was in their interest they became ‘out of danger.’

00:30:35.536 --> 00:30:39.196
David Boder: And what did the SS men need dollars for?

00:30:39.196 --> 00:30:43.057
Mendel Herskovitz: What did they need dollars for? It was for putting away for after the war.

00:30:43.057 --> 00:30:43.576
David Boder: Oh.

00:30:43.576 --> 00:30:45.293
Mendel Herskovitz: It is self-understood.

00:30:45.293 --> 00:30:45.628
David Boder: Hm.

00:30:45.628 --> 00:30:47.489
Mendel Herskovitz: Gold or other things.

00:30:47.489 --> 00:30:49.494
David Boder: Yes. This was traded.

00:30:49.494 --> 00:30:49.580
Mendel Herskovitz: Then...

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:56.822
David Boder: Nu, how did the liberation come about?

00:30:56.822 --> 00:31:01.937
Mendel Herskovitz: The liberation came about ....Wait. Now I will tell you what happened...

00:31:01.937 --> 00:31:02.053
David Boder: Yes?

00:31:02.053 --> 00:31:04.687
Mendel Herskovitz: ...with the...with the remaining Jews.

00:31:04.687 --> 00:31:04.833
David Boder: Yes?

00:31:04.833 --> 00:31:06.509
Mendel Herskovitz: There were two thousand three-hundred Jews still in Czestochowa...

00:31:06.509 --> 00:31:07.219
David Boder: Yes?

00:31:07.219 --> 00:31:31.229
Mendel Herskovitz: ...who still remained. The remaining Jews....We had been sent to Czestochowa [he means Buchenwald] nine hundred men. The remaining Jews who stayed behind, two thousand three hundred Jews, among [whom] were older people, women and children, children from two years old and up [?].

00:31:31.229 --> 00:31:33.478
David Boder: Hm.

00:31:33.478 --> 00:31:41.106
Mendel Herskovitz: They were [to be sent] next day [in the] evening. We had been sent on Tuesday. Tomorrow Wednesday night, they were also supposed to be sent to Buchenwald.

00:31:41.106 --> 00:31:43.193
David Boder: Hm.

00:31:43.193 --> 00:31:46.973
Mendel Herskovitz: They were taken out to the train around three-quarters to eleven.

00:31:46.973 --> 00:31:47.343
David Boder: Yes?

00:31:47.343 --> 00:32:01.062
Mendel Herskovitz: But the German were badly informed about the Russians’ being already near Czestochowa, and around eleven o’clock...the Russians scouts...the tanks...

00:32:01.062 --> 00:32:01.850
David Boder: Yes?

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:03.379
Mendel Herskovitz: ...entered the town.

00:32:03.379 --> 00:32:04.609
David Boder: Hm.

00:32:04.609 --> 00:32:15.143
Mendel Herskovitz: So, that the Germans who drove the two thousand three hundred Jews became confused and they ran away and the Jews became liberated.

00:32:15.143 --> 00:32:16.073
David Boder: Hm.

00:32:16.073 --> 00:32:22.660
Mendel Herskovitz: So that I myself transmitted regards here in France, to people that I knew...on the supposition...

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:23.419
David Boder: Hm.

00:32:23.419 --> 00:32:30.433
Mendel Herskovitz: I based it on this, that I knew that they had been liberated, so I knew to give regards to families...

00:32:30.433 --> 00:32:31.516
David Boder: Hm.

00:32:31.516 --> 00:32:33.544
Mendel Herskovitz: ...hundred percent that those people had remained alive.

00:32:33.544 --> 00:32:34.161
David Boder: Hm.

00:32:34.161 --> 00:32:36.573
Mendel Herskovitz: And they did write letters.

00:32:36.573 --> 00:32:36.772
David Boder: Hm.

00:32:36.772 --> 00:32:43.534
Mendel Herskovitz: To cities that I knew they had been living in, and they have received answers. So, they can...they came to France too.

00:32:43.534 --> 00:32:45.795
David Boder: Nu, and where is your family?

00:32:45.795 --> 00:32:55.636
Mendel Herskovitz: My family...till now I have had no news. Hopies I do not have, and there has remained no one.

00:32:55.636 --> 00:32:55.807
David Boder: And...

00:32:55.807 --> 00:33:01.645
Mendel Herskovitz: Of eighty-one persons altogether who made up the family, aunts and uncles and cousins...

00:33:01.645 --> 00:33:02.530
David Boder: How many persons?

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:03.559
Mendel Herskovitz: Eighty-one persons.

00:33:03.559 --> 00:33:04.590
David Boder: Eighty-one.

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:06.221
Mendel Herskovitz: I am the eighty-first...

00:33:06.221 --> 00:33:06.928
David Boder: Yes?

00:33:06.928 --> 00:33:09.505
Mendel Herskovitz: ...and eighty persons have perished.

00:33:09.505 --> 00:33:13.994
David Boder: How do you know? Maybe...Have you asked? People...

00:33:13.994 --> 00:33:20.692
Mendel Herskovitz: I have already written letters everywhere and I have been answered, ‘Till now we have no signs from them...’

00:33:20.692 --> 00:33:21.170
David Boder: Yes?

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:26.540
Mendel Herskovitz: ‘...and if there will be any, we will send you [word].’ For the time being, I see nothing, no one.

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:33.075
David Boder: Now, here is this. What do you want to do now? What will you...

00:33:33.075 --> 00:33:40.735
Mendel Herskovitz: Now I am learning a trade, and I believe that...that in the future it will be easy for me.

00:33:40.735 --> 00:33:43.097
David Boder: What trade are you learning?

00:33:43.097 --> 00:33:44.009
Mendel Herskovitz: Furrier.

00:33:44.009 --> 00:33:44.555
David Boder: What?

00:33:44.555 --> 00:33:45.368
Mendel Herskovitz: Furrier.

00:33:45.368 --> 00:33:46.289
David Boder: What is that?

00:33:46.289 --> 00:33:47.675
Mendel Herskovitz: Furs.

00:33:47.675 --> 00:33:48.430
David Boder: What?

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:53.949
Mendel Herskovitz: Furs. Nu, fur coats.

00:33:53.949 --> 00:33:54.874
David Boder: [Pause.] What do you make?

00:33:54.874 --> 00:33:56.135
Mendel Herskovitz: [In French] Fourrure.

00:33:56.135 --> 00:33:56.789
David Boder: Furrier?

00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:57.575
Mendel Herskovitz: Furrier.

00:33:57.575 --> 00:33:58.917
David Boder: Oh! With skins.

00:33:58.917 --> 00:33:59.721
Mendel Herskovitz: Skins.

00:33:59.721 --> 00:34:04.102
David Boder: Oh! And where do you want to remain?

00:34:04.102 --> 00:34:08.821
Mendel Herskovitz: I am telling you, I have no hopes. In America I have no family.

00:34:08.821 --> 00:34:09.797
David Boder: You have no family?

00:34:09.797 --> 00:34:10.445
Mendel Herskovitz: No.

00:34:10.445 --> 00:34:10.543
David Boder: Nu?

00:34:10.543 --> 00:34:13.029
Mendel Herskovitz: In other...other countries neither...

00:34:13.029 --> 00:34:13.757
David Boder: Yes?

00:34:13.757 --> 00:34:23.946
Mendel Herskovitz: So the only way out for me is...Palestine. I don’t know how I stand with it. In the meantime I expect to remain in France.

00:34:23.946 --> 00:34:29.517
David Boder: Yes? One doesn’t make out much with furs in Palestine.

00:34:29.517 --> 00:34:32.271
Mendel Herskovitz: If I go to Palestine, naturally, I won’t stay with this trade.

00:34:32.271 --> 00:34:32.798
David Boder: Hm.

00:34:32.798 --> 00:34:41.334
Mendel Herskovitz: There are other trades. There are ‘Kibbutzim” [communal farms], but because of this one thing, I don’t want to join a Kibbutz, because I picture it to myself...it is the same as in a lager.

00:34:41.334 --> 00:34:42.103
David Boder: What?

00:34:42.103 --> 00:34:42.885
Mendel Herskovitz: A kibbutz.

00:34:42.885 --> 00:34:44.656
David Boder: Yes. The same as what? As in a...

00:34:44.656 --> 00:34:48.817
Mendel Herskovitz: Like in camp, a living together [communal life]. And I don’t like such a ‘living together.’

00:34:48.817 --> 00:34:50.229
David Boder: Hm. You do not like ‘living together.’

00:34:50.229 --> 00:34:51.880
Mendel Herskovitz: No. I have already had enough.

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:52.734
David Boder: Hm.

00:34:52.734 --> 00:34:58.714
Mendel Herskovitz: I remember at home we had a family life, and this...to this...for that I am longing again.

00:34:58.714 --> 00:35:02.313
David Boder: You long for a family life, and you have no family in America?

00:35:02.313 --> 00:35:05.827
Mendel Herskovitz: No. I have no family in America, so that I have no way out...

00:35:05.827 --> 00:35:06.353
David Boder: Nu.

00:35:06.353 --> 00:35:07.615
Mendel Herskovitz: ...but to remain here.

00:35:07.615 --> 00:35:23.769
David Boder: Now, if you can do it...I want...I want you to tell me which moment of that whole time...which moment was the worst moment.

00:35:23.769 --> 00:35:24.571
Mendel Herskovitz: The worst?

00:35:24.571 --> 00:35:28.402
David Boder: Yes.

00:35:28.402 --> 00:35:32.741
Mendel Herskovitz: [Thinks.] I did not have any particularly bad moments. I did hunger.

00:35:32.741 --> 00:35:33.547
David Boder: Hm.

00:35:33.547 --> 00:35:46.587
Mendel Herskovitz: But it was according...according to the whole time, there was only a small percentage [of time] and I hungered. Even in the Ghetto I did also. Among us it was called ‘organizing.’ [Footnote: The word ‘organizing’ was a synonym in code for stealing.]

00:35:46.587 --> 00:35:47.367
David Boder: Yes?

00:35:47.367 --> 00:35:51.749
Mendel Herskovitz: Too kosher [legitimate] it was not, but for the hungry one it was called kosher.

00:35:51.749 --> 00:35:52.433
David Boder: Hm?

00:35:52.433 --> 00:36:10.875
Mendel Herskovitz: So whichever way we could help ourselves, we helped [ourselves] so that the family at home also had...also did...hungered much less because of...that...that I helped to earn, so that there should be more food in the house.

00:36:10.875 --> 00:36:13.193
David Boder: Hm.

00:36:13.193 --> 00:36:19.771
Mendel Herskovitz: And a bad moment that I did have has to be combined with the...with the liberation.

00:36:19.771 --> 00:36:20.840
David Boder: Hm.

00:36:20.840 --> 00:37:13.642
Mendel Herskovitz: One day, suddenly....This could have been...or...this could have been... [recollects] on the seventh of April. In the evening, about four o’clock there came an announcement from...through the radio...from the lager elder, a German, an SS man. The announcement went thus: ‘Hello, hello. All Jews in the lager fall in on the appell square. The block elders will see to it that the Jews shall march out.’ A terror gripped the Jews who were in camp.

00:37:13.642 --> 00:37:14.947
David Boder: Was this in Buchenwald?

00:37:14.947 --> 00:37:16.236
Mendel Herskovitz: This was in Buchenwald.

00:37:16.236 --> 00:37:17.694
David Boder: Yes?

00:37:17.694 --> 00:37:40.515
Mendel Herskovitz: A terror gripped the Jews who were in camp. One...one knew what one goes up for. So that...[we knew] to especially isolate us so that we should remain alive, they don’t want. And the contrary a hundred percent yes. So that...so, we didn’t go. On that...on that particular day we didn’t go.

00:37:40.515 --> 00:37:42.953
David Boder: How? How can one not go when one is called?

00:37:42.953 --> 00:37:46.081
Mendel Herskovitz: We said we are not going, and we did not go?[Footnote: This pertained only to the youth barrack, which had, with the sanction of a kind of barracks chief, refused to go. The Jews in other barracks did go. See the interview with Israel Unikowski. B.W.]

00:37:46.081 --> 00:37:47.920
David Boder: How long was this before the liberation?

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:51.516
Mendel Herskovitz: This had....Before the liberation? It was four days. Because on the eleventh...

00:37:51.516 --> 00:37:51.581
David Boder: Oh!

00:37:51.581 --> 00:37:52.769
Mendel Herskovitz: Buchenwald became liberated.

00:37:52.769 --> 00:37:54.891
David Boder: Hm. One did not go, and what did the SS do?

00:37:54.891 --> 00:38:06.825
Mendel Herskovitz: We did not go. In the meantime there was another [announcement through the] radio [to] the block elder that tomorrow morning...that [in the meantime] the Jews should be let back into the lagers, and tomorrow morning around six there will be an appell.

00:38:06.825 --> 00:38:07.697
David Boder: Hm.

00:38:07.697 --> 00:38:14.118
Mendel Herskovitz: An appell of the whole camp, and it was said especially the Jews will be picked out.

00:38:14.118 --> 00:38:15.515
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:38:15.515 --> 00:38:22.118
Mendel Herskovitz: We were let back into the camps. In the meantime one can imagine the panic that had reigned in camp...

00:38:22.118 --> 00:38:22.682
David Boder: Hm.

00:38:22.682 --> 00:38:25.302
Mendel Herskovitz: ...till we already heard the [announcement over the] radio that we can go back into the lager.

00:38:25.302 --> 00:38:26.252
David Boder: Hm.

00:38:26.252 --> 00:38:31.576
Mendel Herskovitz: We ran around and there were given...there were thirty per cent of the prisoners.

00:38:31.576 --> 00:38:32.660
David Boder: Hm.

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:43.474
Mendel Herskovitz: ...who...of other nations, not Jews, who were for us, who also cried that we should not go. I personally came into a block of Frenchmen...

00:38:43.474 --> 00:38:45.908
David Boder: Hm.

00:38:45.908 --> 00:39:01.500
Mendel Herskovitz: ...who...There was one there who...he recognized that I was a Jew. He came over to me and gave me a....In camp one wore a red three-cornered [triangular] insignia.

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:01.946
David Boder: Yes?

00:39:01.946 --> 00:39:05.695
Mendel Herskovitz: Every nation had it own inscription. Frenchmen had an ‘F’.

00:39:05.695 --> 00:39:07.452
David Boder: Hm.

00:39:07.452 --> 00:39:37.502
Mendel Herskovitz: If there were Germans, they had a blue one without anything, without any inscription. Poles had a ‘P’. Other nations had the first...the first letter of their...of the name of their country. He gave me a....I spoke Polish. French I did not know then. So he gave me a three-cornered sign [triangle], a red one with a ‘P’. This denoted a Pole.

00:39:37.502 --> 00:39:40.656
David Boder: Hm.

00:39:40.656 --> 00:39:56.702
Mendel Herskovitz: Like that...like that I sat there till eleven at night. At eleven was the call from the radio that we can go back to the lager and we slept through the whole night. About five in the morning we were awakened. We received twenty-five deka of bread...

00:39:56.702 --> 00:39:57.210
David Boder: Hm.

00:39:57.210 --> 00:40:06.837
Mendel Herskovitz: ...with two deka of margarin. This we ate with coffee, and...

00:40:06.837 --> 00:40:07.973
David Boder: Yes.

00:40:07.973 --> 00:40:28.010
Mendel Herskovitz: ...we went out on the appell square. On the appell square a counting took place with a lot of SS men. And they began to isolate...they began to put the Jews separately. Jews saw what was in store. They began to run away.

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:35.186
David Boder: Did they not call out the guard, yes, to the appell?

00:40:35.186 --> 00:40:54.683
Mendel Herskovitz: They took out especially the Jews. But the Jews knew what this is for. They began to run away. The SS men ran after them. They fired twice [?]. He who could hide himself, hid himself, and the rest all were taken...[The spool ends in mid-sentence.]

00:40:54.683 --> 00:41:43.082
David Boder: [In English] This spool has at the start a wrong identification. It is not 95. It is spool 9-10, a continuation of spool 9-9 of the original spool 9 of Herskovtiz’s report. Boder.

00:41:43.082 --> 00:42:25.129
Herman Barnett: Spool number 95. Spool number 95. Recording start.

00:42:25.129 --> 00:42:40.151
David Boder: This is a continuation of Spool 9. It is still... still Mendel Herskovitz and he is in the middle of the story of the last act... eh, incident of Buchenwald.

00:42:40.151 --> 00:42:41.904
David Boder: [In Yiddish] Nu, and so?

00:42:41.904 --> 00:42:47.362
Mendel Herskovitz: We were taken....There was a campt DAW [Deutsche Automobil Werke]. These had been factories around Buchenwald which, at that time, had been bombed and were in ruins. There the Jews were separately gathered.

00:42:47.362 --> 00:42:49.045
David Boder: What kind of camp?

00:42:49.045 --> 00:42:50.910
Mendel Herskovitz: Near...near Buchenwald...

00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:51.578
David Boder: Yes?

00:42:51.578 --> 00:42:54.263
Mendel Herskovitz: ...were barracks which were called D-A-W.

00:42:54.263 --> 00:42:55.994
David Boder: How?

00:42:55.994 --> 00:42:56.948
Mendel Herskovitz: D-A-W.

00:42:56.948 --> 00:42:57.104
David Boder: D-A-W.?

00:42:57.104 --> 00:42:58.774
Mendel Herskovitz: When a transport was sent away...

00:42:58.774 --> 00:42:58.942
David Boder: Yes?

00:42:58.942 --> 00:43:00.914
Mendel Herskovitz: ...they were gathered in there.

00:43:00.914 --> 00:43:03.752
David Boder: By train or by trucks?

00:43:03.752 --> 00:43:06.883
Mendel Herskovitz: There the railroad was near the lager. It wasn’t far from camp.

00:43:06.883 --> 00:43:08.070
David Boder: Yes?

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:11.834
Mendel Herskovitz: We were gathered there, and we sat there two days.

00:43:11.834 --> 00:43:13.079
David Boder: In the RR-cars?

00:43:13.079 --> 00:43:16.406
Mendel Herskovitz: In the barracks. There were barracks there.

00:43:16.406 --> 00:43:17.027
David Boder: Hm.

00:43:17.027 --> 00:43:19.362
Mendel Herskovitz: We were four thousand men to a barrack.

00:43:19.362 --> 00:43:22.416
David Boder: And how many were taken from Buchenwald?

00:43:22.416 --> 00:43:29.876
Mendel Herskovitz: Jews were gathered then around...there could have been around eight thousand Jews.

00:43:29.876 --> 00:43:30.607
David Boder: Eight thousand Jews from Buchenwald.

00:43:30.607 --> 00:43:31.782
Mendel Herskovitz: Eight thousand Jews.

00:43:31.782 --> 00:43:33.829
David Boder: Yes?

00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:57.242
Mendel Herskovitz: Suddenly, one day, the next day or the day after, it was...were taken out the first- I was in the first barrack- - were taken out around...it was five in the morning SS men came in and told everybody to go outside. The floor was made out of stone, so we built a fire. We tore off board that lay there...

00:43:57.242 --> 00:43:57.498
David Boder: Who did?

00:43:57.498 --> 00:43:58.994
Mendel Herskovitz: ...from the walls. We [did].

00:43:58.994 --> 00:43:59.270
David Boder: Yes?

00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:07.230
Mendel Herskovitz: We built there a fire- - it was in the middle of winter.

00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:09.151
David Boder: The fires were built outside.

00:44:09.151 --> 00:44:12.748
Mendel Herskovitz: Not outside but inside. And so we sat around and told stories...

00:44:12.748 --> 00:44:13.448
David Boder: Hm.

00:44:13.448 --> 00:44:18.480
Mendel Herskovitz: ..[about] various things. And bewailed our...

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:18.564
David Boder: And.

00:44:18.564 --> 00:44:29.467
Mendel Herskovitz: ...our plight in which we are. Suddenly, around five in the morning, we arose. Germans come in and tell everybody to go out.

00:44:29.467 --> 00:44:31.652
David Boder: Hm.

00:44:31.652 --> 00:44:39.474
Mendel Herskovitz: I have...have understood that which everybody understood. But... I understood what the going out was for, especially...

00:44:39.474 --> 00:44:40.439
David Boder: Hm.

00:44:40.439 --> 00:44:45.758
Mendel Herskovitz: So I looked for a place to hide myself. There was a boiler for steam [a steam boiler].

00:44:45.758 --> 00:44:47.630
David Boder: What?

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:50.561
Mendel Herskovitz: A boiler for steam. For heating the hall.

00:44:50.561 --> 00:44:50.905
David Boder: Hm.

00:44:50.905 --> 00:44:52.251
Mendel Herskovitz: Heated it hadn’t been...

00:44:52.251 --> 00:44:52.448
David Boder: Yes.

00:44:52.448 --> 00:44:53.205
Mendel Herskovitz: ...naturally.

00:44:53.205 --> 00:44:54.875
David Boder: Hm. What kind of hall...

00:44:54.875 --> 00:44:56.208
Mendel Herskovitz: But the boiler stood...

00:44:56.208 --> 00:44:57.490
David Boder: What had the hall been before?

00:44:57.490 --> 00:45:00.695
Mendel Herskovitz: The hall...Before there might have been a factory.

00:45:00.695 --> 00:45:04.064
David Boder: Aha. So there was an oven.

00:45:04.064 --> 00:45:05.990
Mendel Herskovitz: So there stood a steam-oven [boiler].

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:08.660
David Boder: Hm.

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:08.660
Mendel Herskovitz: I searched for an entry into it.

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:10.801
David Boder: Hm.

00:45:10.801 --> 00:45:20.341
Mendel Herskovitz: Find it I couldn’t. But yet, I found...I was able to squeeze myself behind where there was...where the coal was put in.

00:45:20.341 --> 00:45:21.303
David Boder: Hm.

00:45:21.303 --> 00:45:22.636
Mendel Herskovitz: Where the oven was fired...

00:45:22.636 --> 00:45:24.010
David Boder: Yes.

00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:26.898
Mendel Herskovitz: I barely made it in there. I went in feet first...

00:45:26.898 --> 00:45:27.904
David Boder: Uh-huh.

00:45:27.904 --> 00:45:31.222
Mendel Herskovitz: ...that the head should stick out so that I should be able to look out every so often.

00:45:31.222 --> 00:45:32.000
David Boder: Hm.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:42.923
Mendel Herskovitz: I wore an overcoat so I put it underneath, where the ashes come out. Thus I lay there till [for] twenty-four hours. After twenty-four hours...

00:45:42.923 --> 00:45:44.184
David Boder: Did you have anything to eat?

00:45:44.184 --> 00:45:47.824
Mendel Herskovitz: I ate absolutely nothing. I didn’t fell that I am hungry.

00:45:47.824 --> 00:45:48.829
David Boder: Hm.

00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:50.306
Mendel Herskovitz: So big was the fright.

00:45:50.306 --> 00:45:51.658
David Boder: Yes.

00:45:51.658 --> 00:46:44.274
Mendel Herskovitz: After twenty-four hours I went out. It was early morning, next day in the early morning. I went out. That...that barracks was already free of guards. It wasn’t guarded, because nobody was supposed to have been in there any more. That I was here, nobody knew, because I had been hiding. I went out and was going to go over to the second barrack which was still full of Jews who were supposed to have been sent on another day. One the way meets me...meets me a sentry who was standing...a German who was standing there. He asks me, ‘Why are you going?’ So I answer him as...as if nothing ever happened. ‘I was here in the latrine and now I am going back to the barrack.’ So he told me...

00:46:44.274 --> 00:46:46.419
David Boder: Didn’t you have a French uniform?

00:46:46.419 --> 00:46:48.017
Mendel Herskovitz: The uniform I didn’t have. I only had the badge.

00:46:48.017 --> 00:46:51.590
David Boder: You only had the badge, nu?

00:46:51.590 --> 00:47:00.930
Mendel Herskovitz: But I did go over again. I went into that block and there I stayed til...till a certain time.

00:47:00.930 --> 00:47:02.783
David Boder: And who was in the block?

00:47:02.783 --> 00:47:10.516
Mendel Herskovitz: In the block already were Jews with Russians. They already began to add from other nations because the entire lager was already supposed to be evacuated.

00:47:10.516 --> 00:47:15.222
David Boder: Nu?

00:47:15.222 --> 00:47:17.614
Mendel Herskovitz: There we stayed for three days.

00:47:17.614 --> 00:47:21.154
David Boder: What was done with the other Jews who had been gathered?

00:47:21.154 --> 00:47:45.564
Mendel Herskovitz: The remaining Jews were led out...were led along the road and, according to the information we have received from a sparse few who showed up later, that the remaining were all...were all slain. They were all shot on the way. There were such people who did not have the strength to walk any farther, and they fell down, and as soon as they sat down they were immediately shot.

00:47:45.564 --> 00:47:48.156
David Boder: Hm.

00:47:48.156 --> 00:49:10.780
Mendel Herskovitz: This happened among the Jews who went on the road [were evacuated]. The remaining, who stayed behind in the other blocks, after three days, on an afternoon, were all told to return to their lager and the last lager was to be evacuated. [Pause.] We returned to the lager around seven in the evening. We slept there. Next morning there was radio [announcement] that an evacuation of the whole lager is taking place, block-wise. Blocks there were...there were in Buchenwald eighty thousand people. Among them were thirty-five nationalities. The next morning one began to take... there was a small lager and a large lager. The large lager [ordinarily] went to work. In the small lager there were the weaker ones who could not go to work. So the first block of the small lager was taken. The last block...the seventieth block....I surmised that the small lager will be taken first.

00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:12.055
David Boder: What was the small lager?

00:49:12.055 --> 00:49:14.255
Mendel Herskovitz: The small lager....There was a small lager which was purposely fenced off with wires.

00:49:14.255 --> 00:49:16.649
David Boder: Yes.

00:49:16.649 --> 00:50:40.371
Mendel Herskovitz: And only later the large camp will be taken. In the meantime it came to pass that [from] the small lager one block was taken. And while the small lager was taken, I prepared myself. I dressed, took what was necessary for the road, and went down. I was located on the second floor. I went downstairs to the courtyard, and there I stood and waited for the departure. I already had told myself, ‘We are lost. What will happen to everybody will happen to me also. I will go.’ So after the small block [the small camp] which was taken on the journey, a German came over and called out that I was to go. The forty-seventh barrack I which I was. It came out that I had to stand in the first ‘row of five.’ [The formation was made up of rows, five to a row.] Because we were arranged in rows. So I say [to myself], ‘No, first of all I do not want to stand in the first five. I will go down. I joined another one and with him I began to edge myself toward the back. In the meantime I lost the other on the way. On the stairs which I wanted to take to the second floor...so I looked for a way up. There were lined up prisoners who were old timers who were supposed to remain, who took care of the block. All people...and they...and they stood with clubs and chased down all the people from upstairs who had hidden themselves.

00:50:40.371 --> 00:50:42.536
David Boder: Jewish people?

00:50:42.536 --> 00:50:46.192
Mendel Herskovitz: There were...we were with Russians together. There had come a fresh transport of Aryans.

00:50:46.192 --> 00:50:48.622
David Boder: But...but the old-timers? The...the...

00:50:48.622 --> 00:50:50.045
Mendel Herskovitz: They were Germans.

00:50:50.045 --> 00:50:50.340
David Boder: Germans?

00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:51.361
Mendel Herskovitz: Gypsies.

00:50:51.361 --> 00:50:51.772
David Boder: What?

00:50:51.772 --> 00:50:52.898
Mendel Herskovitz: Gypsies.

00:50:52.898 --> 00:50:53.615
David Boder: Gypsies?

00:50:53.615 --> 00:50:57.564
Mendel Herskovitz: [With irritation] Gyps-...Gyps-...German...Gypsies who had lived in Germany.

00:50:57.564 --> 00:50:59.246
David Boder: Hm. Gypsies who had lived in Germany.

00:50:59.246 --> 00:51:00.202
Mendel Herskovitz: Who had lived in Germany.

00:51:00.202 --> 00:51:01.944
David Boder: So they were helping the...

00:51:01.944 --> 00:51:03.388
Mendel Herskovitz: They were helping the SS.

00:51:03.388 --> 00:51:06.395
David Boder: Hm. Nu?

00:51:06.395 --> 00:51:22.300
Mendel Herskovitz: Is...I do not know myself how I got upstairs. There was on the opposite side...on the opposite side the moment I got into the entrance of... of the stairs into the corridor....There was a storeroom with ungetuigs. [There follows a rather comic dialogue based on the inability of the interviewer to understand the word or rather the specific enunciation of the Yiddish noun ungetuigs. The word ungetuigs roughly corresponds to the German verb antuen which under some circumstances could be translated to put on, to dress. The English word pull-over is a partial analogue. The word ungetuigs stands for all kinds of clothing.]

00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:23.034
David Boder: Of what?

00:51:23.034 --> 00:51:28.082
Mendel Herskovitz: Of old ungetuigs. How I got on the stairs, I do not know, but near...

00:51:28.082 --> 00:51:30.289
David Boder: Hm.

00:51:30.289 --> 00:51:34.899
Mendel Herskovitz: ...near me....The moment I saw the door [of the storeroom] with old ungetuigs, I gave a look inside.

00:51:34.899 --> 00:51:36.338
David Boder: What is old ungetuigs?

00:51:36.338 --> 00:51:37.435
Mendel Herskovitz: [With despair] Oi wei.

00:51:37.435 --> 00:51:40.073
David Boder: Yes. Nu, tell me, what is it?

00:51:40.073 --> 00:51:41.021
Mendel Herskovitz: [Pointing to his clothes] This here.

00:51:41.021 --> 00:51:41.777
David Boder: Oh! Old clothing!

00:51:41.777 --> 00:51:42.935
Mendel Herskovitz: What is it called in English?

00:51:42.935 --> 00:51:43.785
David Boder: [In German] Clothing.

00:51:43.785 --> 00:51:44.298
Mendel Herskovitz: [In German] Clothing.

00:51:44.298 --> 00:51:44.541
David Boder: Yes.

00:51:44.541 --> 00:51:45.621
Mendel Herskovitz: [Insisting] What is it called in English?

00:51:45.621 --> 00:51:48.460
David Boder: In English? Shirts. Clothes. Clothing. [The above dialogue was omitted in the first typing due to an oversight by the typist and had to be inserted afterwards.]

00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:48.995
Mendel Herskovitz: [In English] Clothing.

00:51:48.995 --> 00:51:49.444
David Boder: Yes.

00:51:49.444 --> 00:51:50.101
Mendel Herskovitz: [Persistently] Clothing.

00:51:50.101 --> 00:51:51.040
David Boder: Yes.

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:52.408
Mendel Herskovitz: [With satisfaction] I have learned already the word.

00:51:52.408 --> 00:51:57.603
David Boder: Yes. Nu? So you went upstairs.

00:51:57.603 --> 00:52:05.873
Mendel Herskovitz: So I went up the stairs and entered and went to the door where there was the [in English] clothing, where there was the old [in English] clothing which was inside.

00:52:05.873 --> 00:52:07.090
David Boder: Yes?

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:19.419
Mendel Herskovitz: Next to me there was standing a Russian. So I say to him, ‘I am going inside. You shut me in.’ So he says to me, ‘Foolish child, you will be found in here.’ So I say, ‘Want to bet? Either yes or no.’

00:52:19.419 --> 00:52:20.647
David Boder: Hm.

00:52:20.647 --> 00:52:29.907
Mendel Herskovitz: And so he shut me in, and I stayed. I remained inside. The whole block was taken away and I myself remained in the block. About this no one knew.

00:52:29.907 --> 00:52:30.608
David Boder: Hm.

00:52:30.608 --> 00:52:34.936
Mendel Herskovitz: All those who were...all the caretakers of block who had remained inside did not know about this.

00:52:34.936 --> 00:52:37.851
David Boder: Hm.

00:52:37.851 --> 00:52:55.954
Mendel Herskovitz: After three hours I heard steps in the corridor. Somebody is approaching and open the door and throws something in and goes away. When I hear him coming, it beat...my heart began to beat faster than his feet were going.

00:52:55.954 --> 00:52:58.982
David Boder: Hm.

00:52:58.982 --> 00:53:16.536
Mendel Herskovitz: When he opened the door, one can imagine what kind of fright gripped me. I thought, now they will take me. I buried myself in the [in English] clothing that was lying still deeper. And so, he threw in something and went away.

00:53:16.536 --> 00:53:16.603
David Boder: Who was it?

00:53:16.603 --> 00:53:18.695
Mendel Herskovitz: After five minutes....Who it was I do not know.

00:53:18.695 --> 00:53:20.015
David Boder: Hm.

00:53:20.015 --> 00:53:33.032
Mendel Herskovitz: One who took care...who possibly took care of the block. One who had remained. After five minutes I got up, looked for the thing he had thrown in. He had thrown in half a sack of flour. [The next few sentences are spoken in a rather jovial manner.]

00:53:33.032 --> 00:53:34.092
David Boder: It was intended for you?

00:53:34.092 --> 00:53:34.907
Mendel Herskovitz: Not for me.

00:53:34.907 --> 00:53:35.291
David Boder: Ha, ha.

00:53:35.291 --> 00:53:36.316
Mendel Herskovitz: It wasn’t for me.

00:53:36.316 --> 00:53:36.611
David Boder: Ha, ha.

00:53:36.611 --> 00:53:38.939
Mendel Herskovitz: It was so. He had a surplus.

00:53:38.939 --> 00:53:39.111
David Boder: Yes.

00:53:39.111 --> 00:53:41.000
Mendel Herskovitz: - -He already had too much so he threw it in.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:44.927
David Boder: Yes.

00:53:44.927 --> 00:53:49.808
Mendel Herskovitz: When I saw flour...nu, at that, flour was also an item [of food]; uncooked flour was also an item [of food].

00:53:49.808 --> 00:53:50.719
David Boder: What did you do with it?

00:53:50.719 --> 00:53:54.304
Mendel Herskovitz: I took it in my mouth. More or less mixed with what one has in his mouth...

00:53:54.304 --> 00:53:55.400
David Boder: Hm.

00:53:55.400 --> 00:54:04.621
Mendel Herskovitz: ...and swallowed. This quieted the hunger a little. After two more hours....There were cauldrons from the coffee which was given in the morning.

00:54:04.621 --> 00:54:05.588
David Boder: Hm.

00:54:05.588 --> 00:55:20.568
Mendel Herskovitz: They wanted to put them in there. Someone came and opened the door, with the cauldrons, and went to put them inside. All of a sudden he noticed something. He closed the door and went away. My heart began to beat a little faster. I...I expected something. What I expected really did come: he called together all who were in the block and he wanted to show them. In spite of having watched, watched so faithfully for the Germans, in spite of that, one is found...in spite of that one has been found who had hidden himself! They came over. I was wrapped in a [in French] blanket. I mean in a [in Polish] blanket. He began go pull on the blanket, but I held on strongly on the other end. I didn’t let myself be uncovered. In the end I saw that I had no way out. Ten men were already standing around...around me, so I uncovered myself, and I began to cry and beg to let me go, ‘I was left by myself. Nobody is here. Nobody will know about it. The Russians are coming any day now. Will it do you any harm?’ They didn’t want to know anything. They led me out. They took me by the collar properly...

00:55:20.568 --> 00:55:20.947
David Boder: Hm.

00:55:20.947 --> 00:55:25.836
Mendel Herskovitz: ...and they led me out on the road where everybody was going ‘on the road.’ Where everybody was going out.

00:55:25.836 --> 00:55:29.599
David Boder: Were they SS men? Germans?

00:55:29.599 --> 00:55:29.783
Mendel Herskovitz: What?

00:55:29.783 --> 00:55:30.333
David Boder: These people?

00:55:30.333 --> 00:55:34.177
Mendel Herskovitz: These people were those faithful henchmen of the Germans...

00:55:34.177 --> 00:55:34.953
David Boder: But, yes...

00:55:34.953 --> 00:55:35.272
Mendel Herskovitz: ...who were also prisoners.

00:55:35.272 --> 00:55:36.595
David Boder: ...didn’t they have guns?

00:55:36.595 --> 00:55:37.220
Mendel Herskovitz: They didn’t have guns.

00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:38.585
David Boder: Hm.

00:55:38.585 --> 00:55:39.838
Mendel Herskovitz: Weapons they didn’t have.

00:55:39.838 --> 00:55:41.935
David Boder: They simply led you out.

00:55:41.935 --> 00:55:55.216
Mendel Herskovitz: Simply led [me] out on the road where people were going. And there already stood other prisoners who were called ‘lager police.’ They were organized by the SS.

00:55:55.216 --> 00:55:56.228
David Boder: Hm.

00:55:56.228 --> 00:56:55.999
Mendel Herskovitz: They guarded inside the lager. I am coming out on the road. So I stop and look over what sort to sick people I am going with. I wasn’t especially...especially weakened I wans’t. The nerves still carried me, which made me strong. I am standing thus and look over. Quickly I contemplated, ‘Am I going to the road? No! I’ll see not to go!’ I had a blanket over me, a plate and pot. These I threw away. I wore the overcoat [?]. All of a sudden I began to walk with a firm step into the sirst street between two blocks. I walked in like...as if it does not mean me. I only walked about ten steps. I thought that I have already succeeded, that I am not going to be notice, and suddenly someone calls after me, ‘Hey! Come back!’ I saw that I am ‘in the package.’ [I am cornered].

00:56:55.999 --> 00:56:56.662
David Boder: Hm.

00:56:56.662 --> 00:58:00.124
Mendel Herskovitz: I had to get [back] and [in Hebrew] to my shame. Oh, you understand what ‘to my shame’ means, and so I go back. I was led out on the road again. I came out on the appell square which had...which had three hundred meters in length, one hundred meters in width. There, every evening, when the lager was still in shape, there the prisoners were counted...if everything checks, whether someone didn’t escape. This square everybody had to cross. They went to the gate and went out on the journey. I came to this square. I stopped with folded arms and began to think, ‘What does one do further?’ I go over to someone who was standing there who led... who guarded the road so nobody should straggle away. He should go out on this road, I go over to him and tell him, ‘I am fifteen years old. How can I go on the road? I have no strength.’ Say he, ‘That is none of my business. If you were brought out here you have to go.’

00:58:00.124 --> 00:58:01.102
David Boder: How old were you?

00:58:01.102 --> 00:58:02.332
Mendel Herskovitz: I was fifteen years old at that time.

00:58:02.332 --> 00:58:04.418
David Boder: Hm.

00:58:04.418 --> 00:58:39.027
Mendel Herskovitz: I was pushed from one to the next one. I was pushed till I came half way....I was already half way across the square. I stopped and said, ‘No! I am not going any farther!’ And I looked around. I saw there were sick people lying. Whether they were really sick or were doing the same trick that I was going to do, I do not know. Suddenly, I threw myself down! I threw myself on the ground.

00:58:39.027 --> 00:58:40.333
David Boder: And so?

00:58:40.333 --> 00:58:50.754
Mendel Herskovitz: I threw myself down. I am dead. I have died. This is the end. I can’t go any farther. Suddenly, I hear that they are beginning to gather the sick, the dead.

00:58:50.754 --> 00:58:52.540
David Boder: Where? On the road or on the square?

00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:54.637
Mendel Herskovitz: On the square where one was lying...

00:58:54.637 --> 00:58:54.918
David Boder: Hm.

00:58:54.918 --> 00:58:56.027
Mendel Herskovitz: ...where one was [word not clear].

00:58:56.027 --> 00:58:57.868
David Boder: Hm.

00:58:57.868 --> 00:59:40.578
Mendel Herskovitz: Suddenly a German comes over to me and gives me a kick. ‘Damn you. Will you get up?’ I didn’t say anything. I pretended that I had...I had died, but yet, with one eye I looked at him like this. With one hand I had covered the face and with one eye I looked out at him. He gives me another kick, ‘Are you getting up or not” If not I pop you.’ I didn’t say nothing again, but I saw he is taking out the pistol and points at me. ‘For the last time, I am telling you,’ says he, ‘if you don’t get up I will pop you.’ In this moment comes over to him...come over another SS man and grabs him by the hand...

00:59:40.578 --> 00:59:41.576
David Boder: Hm.

00:59:41.576 --> 00:59:56.627
Mendel Herskovitz: ...and tells him, “But, man, it is a waste of the bullet that you are going to give him. You can see that he is already dead.’ Then he gave a stronger kick so that I was...that...I was lying...so that I should be lying without...without, without...as if fainted.

00:59:56.627 --> 00:59:57.292
David Boder: Hm.

00:59:57.292 --> 01:00:02.179
Mendel Herskovitz: If I should be picked up, the hand and the feet should hang down as if...as if I were dead.

01:00:02.179 --> 01:00:02.690
David Boder: Hm.

01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:04.207
Mendel Herskovitz: And he gives me a kick. I take such a fall...

01:00:04.207 --> 01:00:05.316
David Boder: What does it mean...

01:00:05.316 --> 01:00:06.652
Mendel Herskovitz: A kick with the foot.

01:00:06.652 --> 01:00:07.870
David Boder: Who?

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:09.115
Mendel Herskovitz: A second SS man.

01:00:09.115 --> 01:00:10.396
David Boder: Yes, but where did he...

01:00:10.396 --> 01:00:12.049
Mendel Herskovitz: He gave me a kick wherever it happened.

01:00:12.049 --> 01:00:13.464
David Boder: Yes, Nu?

01:00:13.464 --> 01:00:26.789
Mendel Herskovitz: I gave such a fall over, with the head...the head down, and he says to him, ‘Now see, he is already dead.’ And they picked themselves up and went away. They went away and me....Everybody was already gathered...

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:28.324
David Boder: Where was that? On the road or on the square?

01:00:28.324 --> 01:00:29.512
Mendel Herskovitz: This was on the square.

01:00:29.512 --> 01:00:32.298
David Boder: Hm. Nu?

01:00:32.298 --> 01:01:00.487
Mendel Herskovitz: They had already gathered nearly everybody. I got up and go over to one of those who guarded the road. I go over to him and tell him, ‘I am fifteen years old,’ I tell him again the same story, to another one, ‘and how can I go on the road?’ Suddenly, I noticed on the sides...on the side are sitting youths of twelve, thirteen, fourteen,fifteen, sixteen years.

01:01:00.487 --> 01:01:00.831
David Boder: Hm.

01:01:00.831 --> 01:01:07.064
Mendel Herskovitz: Up to eighteen years the youths were sitting there. There was a block which was especially for youths.

01:01:07.064 --> 01:01:08.817
David Boder: What kind of youth?

01:01:08.817 --> 01:01:10.759
Mendel Herskovitz: Youth, who had...

01:01:10.759 --> 01:01:11.121
David Boder: Young people.

01:01:11.121 --> 01:01:11.779
Mendel Herskovitz: Young people!

01:01:11.779 --> 01:01:12.437
David Boder: Yes?

01:01:12.437 --> 01:01:13.005
Mendel Herskovitz: Young...children.

01:01:13.005 --> 01:01:14.641
David Boder: How did you say it? Youth...

01:01:14.641 --> 01:01:17.801
Mendel Herskovitz: Youth. Youth.

01:01:17.801 --> 01:01:22.840
David Boder: Yes. Nu? And?

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:58.621
Mendel Herskovitz: And I noticed it from the side,...from far away, that there was a block especially for youth. They didn’t work, and I saw that if I won’t work the hunger will be bigger, and when I did work I had more to eat. I say...I say with my mouth and not with my heart, as the saying goes. And I was not in this block, but I was in a block of older people who were going to work. I reported that I was over eighteen.

01:01:58.621 --> 01:02:00.381
David Boder: But you were fifteen.

01:02:00.381 --> 01:02:02.888
Mendel Herskovitz: I was fifteen, but I reported that I was over eighteen.

01:02:02.888 --> 01:02:05.126
David Boder: Hm.

01:02:05.126 --> 01:02:24.882
Mendel Herskovitz: I go over to him. So I went over to him and spoke a few words with him, and in the meantime someone else came over and also spoke with him that he should let him pass to the side. And while he was standing with him, I do not know from where I got the strenght to run over....And I quickly ran over...ran over to the others.

01:02:24.882 --> 01:02:26.150
David Boder: Yes.

01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:43.344
Mendel Herskovitz: To the children. And I sat down in a way that I was not noticed. In the meantime people were going on the road. One block after another was led through, hundred and thousands [of people]. And so it continued until about one or two [o’clock]. There was an air-raid.

01:02:43.344 --> 01:02:45.660
David Boder: An air-raid.

01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:47.438
Mendel Herskovitz: Planes arrived, American [planes].

01:02:47.438 --> 01:02:48.338
David Boder: Hm.

01:02:48.338 --> 01:02:52.542
Mendel Herskovitz: And everybody was ordered to return to the blocks. These who were on the road...

01:02:52.542 --> 01:02:53.511
David Boder: Hm.

01:02:53.511 --> 01:02:54.580
Mendel Herskovitz: ...near the gate...

01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:54.762
David Boder: Hm.

01:02:54.762 --> 01:04:19.929
Mendel Herskovitz: ...were also told to return to the blocks. We picked ourselves up and went back to the barracks. I went into the barrack which was on hand, mine or not mine, and in the meantime we talked things over, whether there will again be...whether one will be led out again or one will not be led out. We ourselves did not know which it would be. That day nobody was led out any more. A whole night it lasted. We slept through....It is self-understood that sleep we did not. We only lay in deathly fear that one should not in the middle of the night....They will set up machines guns and start shooting, or we should not be led out at night. This lasted...this lying and thinking, till around...till around eight o’clock in the morning. At eight we got up. Food, we received no food. It had already been a day and a half till two days that we had not eaten. And we waited for further word, what our fate would be. Around eleven o’clock there was an alarm. To know exactly what the alarm was about, we did not know.

01:04:19.929 --> 01:04:21.322
David Boder: Yes.

01:04:21.322 --> 01:04:27.058
Mendel Herskovitz: Later, half an hour later, we found out that it had been an air-raid, an enemy alarm.

01:04:27.058 --> 01:04:27.557
David Boder: What?

01:04:27.557 --> 01:04:28.173
Mendel Herskovitz: An enemy alarm.

01:04:28.173 --> 01:04:28.336
David Boder: Hm.

01:04:28.336 --> 01:04:33.096
Mendel Herskovitz: That meant, a half an hour before the enemy enters...

01:04:33.096 --> 01:04:35.800
David Boder: Hm. Yes?

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:43.098
Mendel Herskovitz: ...before the enemy enters there was a five minute...a five minute alarm of one [protracted] tone.

01:04:43.098 --> 01:04:43.749
David Boder: Of one tone?

01:04:43.749 --> 01:04:44.649
Mendel Herskovitz: Of one tone.

01:04:44.649 --> 01:04:46.089
David Boder: What was the meaning of that?

01:04:46.089 --> 01:04:47.807
Mendel Herskovitz: That denoted that the enemy was arriving.

01:04:47.807 --> 01:04:48.538
David Boder: Hm.

01:04:48.538 --> 01:04:51.305
Mendel Herskovitz: That Germany’s enemy was arriving.

01:04:51.305 --> 01:04:53.743
David Boder: The enemy army.

01:04:53.743 --> 01:04:55.603
Mendel Herskovitz: The whistling denoted this.

01:04:55.603 --> 01:04:57.161
David Boder: Yes. Yes?

01:04:57.161 --> 01:05:04.158
Mendel Herskovitz: That all the Germans, the SS men should prepare themselves to take to the road, that in half an hour will come...will arrive the Americans.

01:05:04.158 --> 01:05:06.765
David Boder: Hm. So?

01:05:06.765 --> 01:05:15.998
Mendel Herskovitz: Our joy became very great, but we could not believe ourselves, that this was possible, that there will be...that in another hour we will be free.

01:05:15.998 --> 01:05:18.000
David Boder: Nu?

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:26.224
Mendel Herskovitz: But yet we waited. We said that...something...something was sure. Believe it for sure, we couldn’t, but factually it really meant something.

01:05:26.224 --> 01:05:29.515
David Boder: Hm.

01:05:29.515 --> 01:05:59.637
Mendel Herskovitz: It lasted an hour’s time. We already heard...we already heard shooting from the Americans, and the Germans returned it. We began to stream out on the road from which we heard the American tanks, the assault tanks. We heard rumbling. We heard rolling. At first, the first few minutes, we thought that they are...that they are German...

01:05:59.637 --> 01:06:00.537
David Boder: Yes.

01:06:00.537 --> 01:06:03.586
Mendel Herskovitz: ...but we had the lorgnettes. What is a lorgnette called?

01:06:03.586 --> 01:06:09.881
David Boder: The...the...the...field glasses.

01:06:09.881 --> 01:06:10.719
Mendel Herskovitz: Field Glasses.

01:06:10.719 --> 01:06:11.557
David Boder: Yes?

01:06:11.557 --> 01:06:19.564
Mendel Herskovitz: We had...one had it, a block elder. We looked. From far away we could already see the American star, the white one.

01:06:19.564 --> 01:06:20.722
David Boder: Hm.

01:06:20.722 --> 01:06:22.093
Mendel Herskovitz: So that we already knew...

01:06:22.093 --> 01:06:23.000
David Boder: That they were American.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:40.370
Mendel Herskovitz: ...That they were American. We surged out on the road with our last strengths, which after two days, one can say already after two and a half of not eating, we surged out. We ran three, four kilometers through a forest, a field, broke the wires, which were electrified.

01:06:40.370 --> 01:06:41.395
David Boder: Hm.

01:06:41.395 --> 01:06:49.121
Mendel Herskovitz: We brought wooden beams and with the beams we tore up the wires. We got out. We came our on the road. The Americans didn’t know who we were.

01:06:49.121 --> 01:06:49.430
David Boder: Hm.

01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:53.161
Mendel Herskovitz: They started to point the machine guns at us. They didn’t shoot.

01:06:53.161 --> 01:06:53.926
David Boder: Hm.

01:06:53.926 --> 01:06:56.430
Mendel Herskovitz: We put our hands up.

01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:57.088
David Boder: Hm.

01:06:57.088 --> 01:07:01.629
Mendel Herskovitz: And there...there drove over a tank...

01:07:01.629 --> 01:07:03.034
David Boder: Hm.

01:07:03.034 --> 01:07:05.389
Mendel Herskovitz: ...with a machine gun in the hand ready to shoot.

01:07:05.389 --> 01:07:06.194
David Boder: Hm.

01:07:06.194 --> 01:07:08.352
Mendel Herskovitz: And he asked us who we were.

01:07:08.352 --> 01:07:09.988
David Boder: And what did you say?

01:07:09.988 --> 01:08:00.771
Mendel Herskovitz: In English....We couldn’t answer him so we asked him if he doesn’t speak German, so he said, ‘Yes,’ he speaks German. We began to talk to him in German. We said, ‘Here is Buchenwald.’ He put up a pair of eyes. He did not know where he was. Yet, we saw that his joy was great, that...that...that a lager has been liberated. And so, he started to question us, and first was...there were older people...so he gave us cigarettes and chocolate and other things, with which one really...really could gladden his heart. I had another experience yet. I ran on farther. I had...I ran...I ran on another way.

01:08:00.771 --> 01:08:02.912
David Boder: Why?

01:08:02.912 --> 01:08:15.114
Mendel Herskovitz: Why? Because I had a yen to go on another road. ‘Let me be by myself near a tank. Let me see how...let me talk to one by myself.... How it will come out.’

01:08:15.114 --> 01:08:16.337
David Boder: Hm.

01:08:16.337 --> 01:08:27.328
Mendel Herskovitz: So I chanced upon a tank on which was...only later on I found out that he was a Jew. In the meantime it came out so he pointed the machine gun at me. He didn’t know who I was.

01:08:27.328 --> 01:08:29.519
David Boder: Hm.

01:08:29.519 --> 01:09:44.519
Mendel Herskovitz: And I went over to him. I told him that I was from Buchenwald. He gave...he gave such a shudder. He himself did not know...he didn’t know what to think about this. And asks me in German whether any Jews are here. ‘I say, ‘Jews? I too am a Jew!’ His machine gun fell down...fell down, down from the tank as he was holding it, and he jumped down to me and began to kiss me so that I have...that I didn’t have the strength to hold out from the kisses that he gave me! And he altogether...his ears couldn’t comprehend the words that I spoke to him! And he began...he began to give me different things. He had inside American...American clothes [ungetuigs] he gave me. And he took from me...he said in a few days he will come here to see me. And it really was so. In a few days he was here with me.

01:09:44.519 --> 01:09:45.841
David Boder: [Question not clear.]

01:09:45.841 --> 01:09:48.448
Mendel Herskovitz: The American. That soldier who was on the tank.

01:09:48.448 --> 01:09:48.573
David Boder: Nu?

01:09:48.573 --> 01:09:50.901
Mendel Herskovitz: He came to me into the lager driving the tank.

01:09:50.901 --> 01:09:52.001
David Boder: Nu?

01:09:52.001 --> 01:09:54.048
Mendel Herskovitz: And purposely searched me out.

01:09:54.048 --> 01:09:55.633
David Boder: Nu?

01:09:55.633 --> 01:10:04.199
Mendel Herskovitz: And I didn’t...he has...he has treated me...I have no words! And after that time I didn’t see him any more because, naturally, he went on.

01:10:04.199 --> 01:10:05.769
David Boder: What is his name?

01:10:05.769 --> 01:10:06.294
Mendel Herskovitz: What?

01:10:06.294 --> 01:10:07.697
David Boder: What is the name?

01:10:07.697 --> 01:10:08.562
Mendel Herskovitz: The name I don’t know.

01:10:08.562 --> 01:10:13.695
David Boder: Nu?

01:10:13.695 --> 01:11:28.331
Mendel Herskovitz: I went back to the lager I had...hungry I wasn’t any more. I already had stuffed myself with chocolate, with other things. I came into the lager. There were lot of sick people who couldn’t...couldn’t, alas, walk by themselves, who waited for somebody to bring them something. So there I...I had a lot of things. I distributed to them cigarettes- -This in our lager was an especially important article which...it was very seldom that one came across cigarettes. If one did come across cigarettes... If one did come across...they were dried leaves from trees; And this, one smoked. And then came...the American began to come into the camp. After two days we began to receive dinner. This was still a day before. I got up, and I knew that bread I didn’t receive from the American when I met the tank, but I knew that bread I will receive somewhere else, from a German who is in the lager. So I went up to the one who pulled me out from that...out from the storeroom upstairs [?].

01:11:28.331 --> 01:11:28.914
David Boder: Hm.

01:11:28.914 --> 01:11:30.649
Mendel Herskovitz: I had already seen him...

01:11:30.649 --> 01:11:32.090
David Boder: How was that?

01:11:32.090 --> 01:11:32.897
Mendel Herskovitz: He was a prisoner too.

01:11:32.897 --> 01:11:33.800
David Boder: Hm.

01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:47.459
Mendel Herskovitz: I go up to him and stopped before him, and begin to look at him so. I ask him, ‘Do you recognize me, or don’t you recognize me?’ He said, ‘No, I do not recognize you.’

01:11:47.459 --> 01:11:48.719
David Boder: He was a German?

01:11:48.719 --> 01:11:50.871
Mendel Herskovitz: A German. That gypsy who...

01:11:50.871 --> 01:11:51.007
David Boder: Hm.

01:11:51.007 --> 01:12:32.673
Mendel Herskovitz: ...had pulled me out of the storeroom. So I say, ‘You don’t know me? Now I am going to settle with you. Wait!’ And say to him, ‘I am the one whom you have taken out from the storeroom.’ He became shocked and pale, and he did not know what to answer. He was just in the middle of eating, so he gave me bread. So I say, ‘No, not the bread I mean. Now I want to settle with you for that, because you took me out from the store- room. I begged you like a child a year old, that you should let me go. I am one, left by myself.’ He says, ‘What do you want to do to me? Do what you want with me.’ And so, first of all I am hungry, so I took from him the bread.

01:12:32.673 --> 01:12:35.647
David Boder: Why? The Americans were already there.

01:12:35.647 --> 01:12:39.096
Mendel Herskovitz: For bread I was hungry. The Americans were not yet in the lager.

01:12:39.096 --> 01:12:39.375
David Boder: Oh.

01:12:39.375 --> 01:12:45.485
Mendel Herskovitz: They couldn’t come into the camp because, the...the...the soldiers who walked on foot...

01:12:45.485 --> 01:12:46.469
David Boder: Yes?

01:12:46.469 --> 01:12:49.784
Mendel Herskovitz: ...that means, they who made the...who began to make the arrangements were not yet there.

01:12:49.784 --> 01:12:52.628
David Boder: But you said the tank came in.

01:12:52.628 --> 01:12:55.030
Mendel Herskovitz: The tank drove in only two days later.

01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:56.462
David Boder: Hm.

01:12:56.462 --> 01:12:57.993
Mendel Herskovitz: The tank first drove in two days later.

01:12:57.993 --> 01:12:59.735
David Boder: But the tank with whom you...

01:12:59.735 --> 01:13:01.562
Mendel Herskovitz: The one I talked with, he drove on...

01:13:01.562 --> 01:13:01.753
David Boder: Oh.

01:13:01.753 --> 01:13:01.964
Mendel Herskovitz: ...and only two days later...

01:13:01.964 --> 01:13:02.379
David Boder: Oh, later...

01:13:02.379 --> 01:13:05.646
Mendel Herskovitz: ...he said he will come to me, and two days later he came.

01:13:05.646 --> 01:13:08.970
David Boder: Hm. All right. Nu?

01:13:08.970 --> 01:13:53.017
Mendel Herskovitz: So I say, ‘Now I am letting you go, but, in a few days I shall find you.’ I should have settled with him then and there because I searched for him later. In a few days he was not in the lager any more. That I could not help.

01:13:53.017 --> 01:13:54.499
David Boder: One moment...

01:13:54.499 --> 01:13:59.749
David Boder: [In English] This is Mendel Herskovitz. [spool has become very noisy.]

01:13:59.749 --> 01:14:03.409
David Boder: [In Yiddish] What does this picture remind you of?

01:14:03.409 --> 01:14:03.409
Mendel Herskovitz: This picture can remind me of only one thing.

01:14:03.409 --> 01:14:08.307
David Boder: What is that?

01:14:08.307 --> 01:14:20.217
Mendel Herskovitz: How father was standing near a dying son, or a son was standing near a dying father, or a brother near a brother.

01:14:20.217 --> 01:14:42.964
David Boder: And what doe this picture remind you of? [Aside:] This is #18.

01:14:42.964 --> 01:15:01.768
Mendel Herskovitz: [Pause.] The moment when we stood up to the knees in snow, shivering from the cold. We could stand like this for five [?] hours, on an appell until the block elder would decide to let us inside.

01:15:01.768 --> 01:15:02.620
David Boder: And...

01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:13.107
Mendel Herskovitz: And not one [many] perished at such an appell. About [?] women too...

01:15:13.107 --> 01:15:14.650
David Boder: [Not clear.] Yes?

01:15:14.650 --> 01:15:31.450
Mendel Herskovitz: ...because no women were with us in the lager. But I can only imagine, according to what I see here. I can imagine how I was running with a pair of ghostly eyes and stared in front of me...until I was saved [?] by the liberation.

01:15:31.450 --> 01:15:34.318
David Boder: And what is this?

01:15:34.318 --> 01:15:38.806
Mendel Herskovitz: Here I can only remind myself of childhood years. How I sat at our own table.

01:15:38.806 --> 01:15:40.153
David Boder: What?

01:15:40.153 --> 01:15:43.888
Mendel Herskovitz: The childhood years. How I sat at our own table.

01:15:43.888 --> 01:15:55.706
David Boder: [Aside:] Number one. And what is this?

01:15:55.706 --> 01:16:02.305
Mendel Herskovitz: Country place at home where we often went.

01:16:02.305 --> 01:16:26.931
David Boder: That was number two. Yes, one moment. Now number three, BM.

01:16:26.931 --> 01:16:31.434
Mendel Herskovitz: [Pause.] A sick prisoner and a hungry one, without hope.

01:16:31.434 --> 01:16:36.078
David Boder: Hm. Well Mendel...

01:16:36.078 --> 01:16:36.747
Mendel Herskovitz: That is all?

01:16:36.747 --> 01:16:52.026
David Boder: That was good. We have learned a lot from your story. We have heard some in America during the war, but no matter how much one hears, it is not enough.

01:16:52.026 --> 01:16:59.695
Mendel Herskovitz: I do not that much of...I do not have that much in me of the poetical power that I should be able to relate everything.

01:16:59.695 --> 01:17:02.351
David Boder: One does not need poetical powers...

01:17:02.351 --> 01:17:03.658
Mendel Herskovitz: I cannot...

01:17:03.658 --> 01:17:07.053
David Boder: ...to tell in simple words.

01:17:07.053 --> 01:17:38.232
Mendel Herskovitz: It is....How much one can...a person simply cannot imagine it, and a writer cannot describe it, every moment separately that one...what the one went through and what he saw that others went through. That on an evening a German could come in when we sat and we ate the soup. He could come in, distribute cigarettes, and suddenly take out the pistol and begin shooting those who were sitting. He could [words not clear].

01:17:38.232 --> 01:17:40.118
David Boder: Did you yourself see that?

01:17:40.118 --> 01:17:41.592
Mendel Herskovitz: I saw that too.

01:17:41.592 --> 01:17:42.139
David Boder: Where was that?

01:17:42.139 --> 01:17:44.431
Mendel Herskovitz: The bullet by chance did not hit me.

01:17:44.431 --> 01:17:45.079
David Boder: What?

01:17:45.079 --> 01:17:47.295
Mendel Herskovitz: The bullet by chance did not hit me. Surely I saw it.

01:17:47.295 --> 01:17:50.344
David Boder: You saw it. Where was that?

01:17:50.344 --> 01:18:02.197
Mendel Herskovitz: This was in the lager. [Pause.] In Dachau.

01:18:02.197 --> 01:18:03.532
David Boder: Were you in Dachau?

01:18:03.532 --> 01:18:04.053
Mendel Herskovitz: What?

01:18:04.053 --> 01:18:04.929
David Boder: Have you been in Dachau?

01:18:04.929 --> 01:18:07.319
Mendel Herskovitz: I was in Dachau too, maybe two days, passing through.

01:18:07.319 --> 01:18:09.520
David Boder: What did you do? Tell me.

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:19.483
Mendel Herskovitz: To Dachau we were only taken by train. Food we were not given. We were taken out into a barrack which was right near the train, and from here we were taken in the morning to go on.

01:18:19.483 --> 01:18:22.990
David Boder: You were telling me . Who gave the cigarettes?

01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:23.969
Mendel Herskovitz: I have told you that.

01:18:23.969 --> 01:18:25.940
David Boder: Yes. What did he do?

01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:29.778
Mendel Herskovitz: We were sitting there in the lager where...there in that barrack we were for two days.

01:18:29.778 --> 01:18:30.502
David Boder: Hm.

01:18:30.502 --> 01:18:34.022
Mendel Herskovitz: We received there a soup. It was in the evening.

01:18:34.022 --> 01:18:35.538
David Boder: Hm.

01:18:35.538 --> 01:18:49.813
Mendel Herskovitz: Suddenly a German came in and he gave everybody cigarettes. Every body had already finished smoking. He took out the pistol, which was loaded with bullets, and shot at those who were sitting. And ten people...

01:18:49.813 --> 01:18:50.817
David Boder: [Not clear.]

01:18:50.817 --> 01:18:56.289
Mendel Herskovitz: He was drunk, too, at that instance.

01:18:56.289 --> 01:18:56.505
David Boder: Hm.

01:18:56.505 --> 01:18:58.783
Mendel Herskovitz: If he was drunk, there was not responsibility. That was just so.

01:18:58.783 --> 01:19:09.838
David Boder: [In English] This concludes Spool 10, a continuation of 9. What is the name of this place? Chateau...

01:19:09.838 --> 01:19:11.150
Mendel Herskovitz: Chateau Boucicaut.

01:19:11.150 --> 01:19:38.815
David Boder: Taken at Chateau de Boucicaut on July 31st, 1946. And the boy is Mendel Herskovitz now, at present, eighteen years of age, studying to be a furrier. He has no intention to go to Palestine, no intention to go to the United States, and intends to remain in the States [correction] remain in France.
