David Boder: I see.

00:12:02.129 --> 00:12:18.486
Malka Johles: My husband should not have had any [unintelligible] to go to Toulouse. But the gendarmes came from, err, from Toulouse and said to each they have to register.

David Boder: Why?

00:12:51.784 --> 00:12:55.425

David Boder: Yes.

00:13:57.231 --> 00:14:37.901
Malka Johles: We had, err, err, wanted to deny. Because they, what came from Brens, they didn’t want to give help. And then he said, well, you get one week until we get the list to show that you really didn’t come from Brens, so you are not getting any aid. Then my husband said, do as you please. My child had, err, temperature, an inflammation of the middle ear and nevertheless, we fled. To, to Lyon. Because we, err, had learned that we would be sent away otherwise. Then we had to flee, with the child who was sick with the ear infection. And, then we came, had great difficulties. Not with the stay, but with the aid.

David Boder: Yes.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:41.467

David Boder: Yes.

00:14:41.998 --> 00:14:47.560
Malka Johles: So they couldn’t threaten us anymore, then they gave us financial aid like they should.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.591
David Boder: So, they didn’t want people to leave Brens?

00:14:49.591 --> 00:15:01.872
Malka Johles: Leave Brens...., because we had the Toulouse Committee, probably, or...I don’t know, or the Marseille, ha...had allegedly built or bought the camp. It is supposed to have cost a million francs.

00:15:08.145 --> 00:15:09.363
David Boder: And then?

00:15:09.363 --> 00:15:24.377
Malka Johles: And then, err, we were there, in Lyon, of course. There, we had to live from the aid. It was very, very little, naturally. But on March 16th, they recruited my husband, took him out of work.

David Boder: Yes.

00:16:34.585 --> 00:16:40.488

00:16:59.849 --> 00:17:00.412
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:00.412 --> 00:17:02.240
Malka Johles: The admin...you know, the prefectia had there a...

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:02.755
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:02.755 --> 00:17:31.269
Malka Johles: A hospital and the, err, the camp [unintelligible] ...the battle, laborers, err, my husband said, no, I won’t have surgery done in St. Julien, I would like to go to Lyon, where my wife is and if something happens...Then he said, he can’t do anything and he already asked the prefectia. Yes, and to Lyon, they came to me, a few times, those people from the prefectia, that is from the administration. I was to accept the financial aid. I said, I won’t take any. They wanted to give me for my children and for me...assistance.

00:17:31.269 --> 00:17:31.753
David Boder: Why?

00:17:31.753 --> 00:17:33.894
Malka Johles: Because my husband worked there.

00:17:33.894 --> 00:17:34.738
David Boder: I see.

00:17:34.738 --> 00:17:36.051
Malka Johles: He did, after all, err, a [unintelligible]...

00:17:36.051 --> 00:17:36.660
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.035
Malka Johles: He worked there legitimately?

00:17:38.035 --> 00:17:39.504
David Boder: Yes. So they wanted to give you assistance.

00:17:39.504 --> 00:18:02.737
Malka Johles: Yes, a worker, err, [unintelligible] “travailleur étranger” it was called. I said no, because I was afraid to accept help from them. So, when, err, when they [unintelligible] my boy inside begins to cry and to plead with the commander, if my husband could, please, have surgery done.

00:18:02.737 --> 00:18:03.487
David Boder: Hmm...

00:18:03.487 --> 00:18:44.797
Malka Johles: So he, he called the doctor of St. Julien right away and the doctor came on Monday the 24th. And, err, he explained to my husband that he is sick and he took him with him, in his car to St. Julien. So the Gestap— ..., no, not the Gestapo, but the [unintelligible] let him go. When the doctor from the hospital said that the man had high temperature and he had to be operated on. On the 24th, my husband was operated and he had to himself [unintelligible] lain in St. Julien. That is on the border, that’s, when you...when you leave the Jewish cemetery, from Geneva, it borders right onto the hospital, on St. Julien.

00:18:44.797 --> 00:18:47.140
David Boder: That’s all in Switzerland?

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:49.734
Malka Johles: On the border to Switzerland, I think. Not far.

00:18:49.734 --> 00:18:50.140
David Boder: Yes.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:54.625
Malka Johles: When you leave the hospital and walk to its garden, you can already see, you’re already on the border.

00:18:54.625 --> 00:18:55.219
David Boder: And then?

00:18:55.219 --> 00:19:07.665
Malka Johles: On the Swiss border. My husband was operated there, on the hernia. My boy, he speaks French perfectly...Of course I didn’t know where my boy was! He had sent me a telegram that my husband was, thanks be to God, in the hospital.

00:19:07.665 --> 00:19:08.352
David Boder: Hmm...

00:19:08.352 --> 00:19:25.296
Malka Johles: And that he was not in battle. And that he had already been operated on. When he’ll come back, he telegraphed, he didn’t know – my boy. I didn’t leave. I didn’t hide. Err, I thought, maybe they are not searching for me. It was known that my husband is...working.

00:19:25.296 --> 00:19:26.452
David Boder: Is working.

00:19:26.452 --> 00:19:33.191
Malka Johles: Yes. And the little one was only four and a half years old. So I didn’t leave. Because I thought if I do, my boy will come and then he might not know where I am.

00:19:33.191 --> 00:19:34.003
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:34.003 --> 00:19:38.933
Malka Johles: And my hus...my boy was three days in St. Julien and not registered.

00:19:38.933 --> 00:19:39.683
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:39.683 --> 00:20:45.850
Malka Johles: In the hotel. She was very nice, the woman didn’t register his card. And then she said, she can’t do that, she has to register him because if a police patrol comes by...And as she registers him and as my boy leaves the hospital from visiting, as visiting hours were over, there stood three gendarmes and arrested the boy. On the [unintelligible] they said, you are registered, you are staying in the hotel, what are you doing there? So my boy says, as you can see, I was there for my Dad...Well, what are you doing there? Why does your Dad need you, when he’s in the hospital? Then he says, my Dad doesn’t speak a word of French and I just wanted to be there, so that my Dad understands things. Well, they say, what is going to happen with you now? So he says, I would like to go home to my Mum, back to Lyon. Then he says, I see! Your mum is long gone, like all Jews. They’re all already caught and what are we going to do with you now? So my boy started to cry terribly. He was afraid, they would deport him. But one of them, one of them, err, he was older...

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:47.225
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:47.225 --> 00:21:09.439
Malka Johles: A commissioner. He said, don’t cry, he said, I have four [unintelligible] myself, that is kids, at home. I won’t do you any harm. He says: I won’t do you any harm at all. Boy, don’t cry, calm down. If you think that your Mum is still in Lyon, send her a telegram and, err, go, and, err, go. So, I received a telegram, saying that my boy...

00:21:09.439 --> 00:21:10.283
David Boder: Was coming.

00:21:10.283 --> 00:21:14.655
Malka Johles: Was coming. I wa, wa, was afraid to go to the...

00:21:14.655 --> 00:21:15.343
David Boder: Train station.

00:21:15.343 --> 00:21:27.278
Malka Johles: Train station. It was so dangerous, you know. So I waited behind the bushes. I knew what time he would arrive, so now I waited. I whistled to him and he whistled back and so we identified each other. And that was in the middle of the night.

00:21:27.278 --> 00:21:28.559
David Boder: He whistled?

00:21:28.559 --> 00:21:28.919
Malka Johles: Yes, because I couldn’t come....

00:21:28.919 --> 00:21:31.482
David Boder: Did you have a certain melody?

00:21:31.482 --> 00:21:32.873
Malka Johles: Yes, he already knew.

00:21:32.873 --> 00:21:33.748
David Boder: What was it?

00:21:33.748 --> 00:22:00.234
Malka Johles: Well, just something whistled and then he already knew. And then he came back and told me, that my husband had had surgery, and that they wanted to arrest him and so, from this hour on, of course, we didn’t sleep at home anymore. And then we stayed with a neighbor. Then my boy went to see my husband another time. He was already doing a little better. And then my boy went yet another time to the battle. But that...that is not so important.

00:22:00.234 --> 00:22:02.187
David Boder: What do you mean by “battle”?

00:22:02.187 --> 00:22:04.125
Malka Johles: In, in [unintelligible], where my husband was, is...

00:22:04.125 --> 00:22:06.719
David Boder: Yes, yes, that is all very important. Everything is important....

00:22:06.719 --> 00:22:09.063
Malka Johles: Yes. And because the camp was still....

00:22:09.063 --> 00:22:09.563
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:09.563 --> 00:22:25.661
Malka Johles: And my husband didn’t know what to do.... Yes. The, the nurse, the hospital nurse told my husband that when he in St. Mary [unintelligible] an stand up alright, she will see that he’ll get across the border.

00:22:25.661 --> 00:22:26.786
David Boder: To Switzerland.

00:22:26.786 --> 00:22:38.880
Malka Johles: To Switzerland. Then he said, I can’t go alone, I have two kids, and, and a wife. What should I do? And I didn’t have the guts to go to St. Julien, because they take people off the “autopiste”.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:39.224
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:39.224 --> 00:22:54.535
Malka Johles: So my husband, err, my boy went to the commander of the camp and obtained a, a, a, a, err, sick leave for a month. And with the note, he went to the hospital.

00:22:54.535 --> 00:22:55.051
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:55.051 --> 00:23:05.047
Malka Johles: My boy, and he brought my husband home to Lyon. So, err, he was still very sick. And, so he came [unintelligible], not because of the surgery, but because of everything.

00:23:05.047 --> 00:23:06.254
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:06.254 --> 00:23:08.941
Malka Johles: He came home. And then we were there for a few days.

00:23:08.941 --> 00:23:10.160
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:14.769
Malka Johles: My husband, after all, had the sick leave from the hospital and on top the one from the battle.

00:23:14.769 --> 00:23:17.629
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:17.629 --> 00:23:37.862
Malka Johles: So, this cost us extra [unintelligible], and...but we also hid. And then we...my husband said, he’s strong enough now, he won’t stay, despite the sick leave, he said, I won’t stay. And so we decided to leave, in God’s name.

00:23:37.862 --> 00:23:38.534
David Boder: Where to?

00:23:38.534 --> 00:23:40.159
Malka Johles: To the border.

00:23:40.159 --> 00:23:40.628
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:40.628 --> 00:23:42.300
Malka Johles: And, err, luckily we crossed it.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:43.643
David Boder: Crossed it.

00:23:43.643 --> 00:23:43.986
Malka Johles: Yes.

00:23:43.986 --> 00:23:46.251
David Boder: Well, how did you get across, err?

00:23:46.251 --> 00:23:48.032
Malka Johles: We were in [unintelligible] there,...

00:23:48.032 --> 00:23:48.906
David Boder: So, who met you when you were...

00:23:48.906 --> 00:23:50.188
Malka Johles: At a...the...

00:23:50.188 --> 00:23:51.468

Malka Johles: Yes, in Geneva, yes.

00:23:53.328 --> 00:23:55.171
David Boder: Yes, well? Where were you?

00:23:55.171 --> 00:23:57.827
Malka Johles: We were in a kind of reception camp, only one night.

00:23:57.827 --> 00:24:00.202
David Boder: That was in the beginning...

00:24:00.202 --> 00:24:00.780
Malka Johles: Yes, just one night.

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:02.811
David Boder: They didn’t want to send you back?

00:24:02.811 --> 00:24:04.514
Malka Johles: No, the child was still so...

00:24:04.514 --> 00:24:05.732
David Boder: What?

00:24:05.732 --> 00:24:07.794
Malka Johles: It was, the child was not even five years old.

00:24:07.794 --> 00:24:10.575
David Boder: I see. So, did they [unintelligible]...

00:24:10.575 --> 00:24:14.044
Malka Johles: Yes. Nobody gave us trouble. One other family they sent back.

00:24:14.044 --> 00:24:15.059
David Boder: Why?

00:24:15.059 --> 00:24:18.402
Malka Johles: Before us. Because, it was just... they said it was a deadline.

00:24:18.402 --> 00:24:19.073
David Boder: What?

00:24:19.073 --> 00:24:23.261

00:24:29.496 --> 00:24:33.480
Malka Johles: They sent them back. But they, err, after four times they crossed over and then made it. Now they are in Chent (unclear).

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:36.230
David Boder: Where?

Malka Johles: In Chent. They work...

00:24:37.714 --> 00:24:38.230
David Boder: Where is that?

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.886
Malka Johles: Chent, near Paris.

00:24:38.886 --> 00:24:39.527
David Boder: Oh!

00:24:39.527 --> 00:24:42.058
Malka Johles: Yes. They are doing very well. They didn’t send us, err...

Malka Johles: Yes.

00:24:48.588 --> 00:24:50.275
David Boder: And then what did they do with you right after?

00:24:50.275 --> 00:24:51.884
Malka Johles: What did they do with us?

00:24:51.884 --> 00:24:53.524
David Boder: Yes, where were you....

00:24:53.524 --> 00:24:55.024

David Boder: Yes.

00:24:59.993 --> 00:25:05.430
Malka Johles: “Territorialkommando” [Territorial authorities]. And then they put us into a hotel. They gave us financial assistance.

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:07.180
David Boder: The Jewish Swiss group?

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:09.649

David Boder: Is that a Jewish comm...

00:25:11.165 --> 00:25:20.868
Malka Johles: A Jewish, yes. And then we received assistance from the Polish consulate, after a month or so, in October, err, we already received, err, directly from the Polish consulate.

00:25:20.868 --> 00:25:21.805
David Boder: Why from the consulate?

00:25:21.805 --> 00:25:23.414
Malka Johles: Because my husband was a Polish national.

00:25:23.414 --> 00:25:24.882
David Boder: You were not from Poland?

00:25:24.882 --> 00:25:26.585
Malka Johles: (Silent)

00:25:26.585 --> 00:25:27.459
David Boder: You are not in Poland....

Malka Johles: I was born in Poland. Because was Polish. My husband, too.

00:25:29.631 --> 00:25:30.912
David Boder: So, so you both were Polish nationals?

00:25:30.912 --> 00:25:35.271
Malka Johles: Yes, yes. Only, my hus..., my passport was taken away in Vienna.

00:25:35.271 --> 00:25:36.115
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:36.115 --> 00:25:40.683
Malka Johles: When Hitler came and my husband still had his pass, he extended it before Hitler came, he still...

00:25:40.683 --> 00:25:41.881
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:41.881 --> 00:25:43.068
Malka Johles: Could identify himself, that he, err, err...

00:25:43.068 --> 00:25:44.897
David Boder: And the Polish supported you then?

00:25:44.897 --> 00:25:47.272
Malka Johles: Supported us, yes. Until March ’43.

00:25:47.272 --> 00:25:49.584
David Boder: Yes. And then? What happened then?

00:25:49.584 --> 00:26:07.692
Malka Johles: Then, err, in March ’43, there was big trouble, my boy came into a Zionist home near Geneva. And for me, my child and for my husband, they did pay, but it was very, very difficult. One month.

00:26:07.692 --> 00:26:09.020
David Boder: And you lived in a private house?

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:16.935
Malka Johles: Then I did, first I lived...until February ’43, I lived in a hotel and then I was, I had to take a furnished apartment.

00:26:16.935 --> 00:26:17.685
David Boder: Well?

00:26:17.685 --> 00:26:20.669
Malka Johles: Not an empty apartment. We rented a furnished apartment...

00:26:20.669 --> 00:26:21.591
David Boder: Unfurnished?

00:26:21.591 --> 00:26:22.685
Malka Johles: Furnished.

00:26:22.685 --> 00:26:23.435
David Boder: Furnished.

00:26:23.435 --> 00:26:24.091
Malka Johles: Only furnished apartments. Yes.

00:26:24.091 --> 00:26:26.528
David Boder: Were there any apartments to rent? There were so many people there!

00:26:26.528 --> 00:26:32.544
Malka Johles: There were...were maybe, err... In each alley, there were maybe, err, fifty, sixty apartments to rent!

00:26:32.544 --> 00:26:33.403
David Boder: Why were there...?

00:26:33.403 --> 00:26:34.309
Malka Johles: In each alley!

00:26:34.309 --> 00:26:36.356
David Boder: How is it possible that there were none...?

00:26:36.356 --> 00:26:40.965
Malka Johles: Well, now there are none to rent. Now, unfortunately, I live in a furnished apartment. Also furnished.

00:26:40.965 --> 00:26:42.527
David Boder: I see. And then?

00:26:42.527 --> 00:26:53.849
Malka Johles: Then, in March they still paid. In April they said that only my husband....that my husband could no longer be supported. Just me, because I was diagnosed by the doctor that I was sick...by a Polish doctor.

00:26:53.849 --> 00:26:55.583
David Boder: But your husband was also sick...

00:26:55.583 --> 00:27:03.817
Malka Johles: My husband, they said, they could not pay anymore. The Zurich Committee did that for my husband. And me and my child were supported by the Polish Consulate. Until August, err, August ’43.

00:27:03.817 --> 00:27:08.302
David Boder: Yes.

00:27:08.302 --> 00:27:18.083
Malka Johles: On August 20th ’43 I received a note that I had to go to the camp, to [unintelligible]. That is high up in the mountains, on 1400 meter.

00:27:18.083 --> 00:27:19.583
David Boder: Hmm....with the child.

00:27:19.583 --> 00:27:23.759
Malka Johles: Near Montreux. With my child and my husband was in the labor camp. Here [unintelligible]. It is near St. Moritz.

00:27:23.759 --> 00:27:24.302
David Boder: Yes.

00:27:24.302 --> 00:27:25.176
Malka Johles: Not that, the other St. Moritz.

00:27:25.176 --> 00:27:25.645
David Boder: Yes.

00:27:25.645 --> 00:27:27.504
Malka Johles: Do you know the area? No?

00:27:27.504 --> 00:27:29.816
David Boder: [unintelligible]

David Boder: How, err, tell me, you’ve had your affidavit since how long?

00:32:15.696 --> 00:32:34.034
Malka Johles: Already in Vienna we had an affidavit, in Lyon we ha...had a visa approval. In ’42, in August. And now in October I also got from Washington, err...in October, err, ’45, I got...from Washington, a visa approved.

00:32:34.034 --> 00:32:34.783
David Boder: Yes.

00:32:34.783 --> 00:32:50.575
Malka Johles: So my husband’s sister writes. If we can’t get preferred treatment. Because we already...in October...last years...got the, the, the...visa approved. If we couldn’t be favored in any way. With the quota and all.

00:32:50.575 --> 00:32:51.887
David Boder: Your sister wrote that?

00:32:51.887 --> 00:32:53.730
Malka Johles: Yes, the sister of my husband.

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:54.324
David Boder: [unintelligible]

00:32:54.324 --> 00:32:57.995
Malka Johles: It’s because we have it, we...I have the approval in writing. From Washington.

00:32:57.995 --> 00:32:58.401
David Boder: Yes.

00:32:58.401 --> 00:33:01.681
Malka Johles: And now we just received the visa approval from Zurich in May.

00:33:01.681 --> 00:33:03.352
David Boder: And now?

00:33:03.352 --> 00:33:15.754
Malka Johles: But that...My brother-in-law says, why...why, err, that we don’t, err, care about it in Zurich. If we couldn’t be favored. With the quota. Because we already got an approval last year from Washington.

00:33:15.754 --> 00:33:17.879
David Boder: Where is your, err....

00:33:17.879 --> 00:33:19.253

00:33:20.268 --> 00:33:22.705
Malka Johles: In New York. I’ll give you...I don’t know, I don’t have...

00:33:22.705 --> 00:33:24.017

David Boder: And what does your Consul say about this?

00:33:26.735 --> 00:33:43.559
Malka Johles: The Consul says that, that I got ...from Washington last year. I sent that in. And then he scream...he says that that was a mistake by the issuers of the affidavit. Instead of having it sent to Zurich last year, he sent it to Washington. It does not work like that.

00:33:43.559 --> 00:33:45.356
David Boder: I see. And, err...

00:33:45.356 --> 00:33:46.965
Malka Johles: They, err...they can’t favor anybody.

00:33:46.965 --> 00:33:48.511
David Boder: And now did he send it in to Zurich?

00:33:48.511 --> 00:33:50.464
Malka Johles: Yes, we already did...

00:33:50.464 --> 00:33:51.761
David Boder: And what did he say, the [unintelligible]...

00:33:51.761 --> 00:34:14.480
Malka Johles: The visa approval, we already received it in May. Last week they wrote us, they confirmed that we had sent it in, err...in May. Pictures, documents and everything. Only last week, after four months, they confirm that they have received it, and if I was to come in, err...immediately, they would, err...we would be taken care of. The papers are all good.

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:18.557
David Boder: Yes, I think they might be a bit slow, because there aren’t any ships out there yet.

00:34:18.557 --> 00:34:21.916
Malka Johles: There are ships alright. If only the quota would...

00:34:21.916 --> 00:34:21.916
David Boder: Well, that is why they keep...

00:34:21.916 --> 00:34:22.775
Malka Johles: We would already look for...

00:34:22.775 --> 00:34:26.529
David Boder: Well, they keep the quota small, because they don’t have any ships yet, for example...

00:34:26.529 --> 00:34:27.773
Malka Johles: I don’t know about that, but in any case...

00:34:27.773 --> 00:34:30.726
David Boder: You don’t know that...Err, did the consul think...[unintelligible]...

00:34:30.726 --> 00:34:39.209
Malka Johles: Last year we had prospect to go to Palestine and to America. And now, unfortunately, we, we cannot wait that long, until we get to Palestine.

00:34:39.209 --> 00:34:39.662
David Boder: Yes.

00:34:39.662 --> 00:34:44.442
Malka Johles: Not in a lifetime. And so we would, would like to go to America...[unintelligible].

00:34:44.442 --> 00:34:50.488
David Boder: Well, but maybe your, err, your people in Boston...

00:34:50.488 --> 00:34:51.644
Malka Johles: Alas! They....[unintelligible]

00:34:51.644 --> 00:34:59.659
David Boder: And from New York, if they would talk with their senator or with somebody or with the [unintelligible] in charge, who can give you an affidavit?

00:34:59.659 --> 00:35:10.017
Malka Johles: He did and my husband’s sister did...[unintelligible] give something, too. She wanted us to be ok. So she gave one, too. She is a refugee, herself. Just left Brussels.

00:35:13.969 --> 00:35:16.141
Malka Johles: To go to America. From Brussels [unintelligible]...

00:35:16.141 --> 00:35:17.969
David Boder: Is she by herself or is she...

00:35:17.969 --> 00:35:18.728
Malka Johles: She did....by the name ...[unintelligible]...Johles...[unintelligible]...No, and...

00:35:18.728 --> 00:35:19.406
David Boder: Yes.

00:35:19.406 --> 00:35:21.000
Malka Johles: She has two children, so...

Malka Johles: My husband complains that...that...

00:35:24.343 --> 00:35:35.154
David Boder: With so many people who can do something for you, it’ll happen really quickly. One morning you’ll get it and then you will have to leave in, err, one week or two, go. When...

00:35:35.154 --> 00:35:47.918
Malka Johles: Well one does...how do you say, when something takes that long, it’s almost like cancer...[unintelligible]. That is like, still and still....and now one is pestered with this everyday...

Malka Johles: Yes, unfortunately.

00:35:50.887 --> 00:35:52.184

Malka Johles: Also, err, at the same time like we did, together with us.

David Boder: She crossed the border together with you...

00:36:50.227 --> 00:36:57.679
Malka Johles: Yes, we had to endure a lot on the border. But, err, thanks be to God, it went, err...the main thing is we made it. But on the way here, we had a mishap.

00:36:57.679 --> 00:36:58.586
David Boder: What happened?

00:36:58.586 --> 00:37:03.648

Malka Johles: To the guide.

00:37:13.022 --> 00:37:14.006
David Boder: One moment please.

00:37:14.006 --> 00:37:16.255
Malka Johles: So that we didn’t have to ride the autobus.

00:37:16.255 --> 00:37:17.130
David Boder: Wait a minute please.

00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:22.864
Malka Johles: Yes. So that we didn’t need the autobus...[unintelligible]. It was too dangerous to ride the public autobus.

00:37:22.864 --> 00:37:23.708
David Boder: ...Wait a minute.

00:37:23.708 --> 00:37:24.146
Malka Johles: Yes.

00:37:24.146 --> 00:37:25.786
David Boder: (Silence)

00:37:25.786 --> 00:37:32.567
Malka Johles: One can’t possibly...much to tell, my good man.

00:37:32.567 --> 00:37:33.036
David Boder: Why not?

00:37:33.036 --> 00:37:34.442
Malka Johles: Alas, there is so much to tell.

00:37:34.442 --> 00:37:38.426
David Boder: Yes, what do you want them to know?

00:37:38.426 --> 00:37:39.973
Malka Johles: [unintelligible]

00:37:39.973 --> 00:37:46.473

00:37:46.473 --> 00:37:50.316
Malka Johles: There. [unintelligible] should they experience, [unintelligible] what it’s like to sit on, on boxes...

00:37:50.316 --> 00:37:58.207
David Boder: [In English] This is Spool 90, Mrs. Malka Johles continues.

00:37:58.207 --> 00:38:01.879
David Boder: [In German] So tell me, I wanted to know, you said earlier...when you crossed the border...

00:38:01.879 --> 00:38:04.660

David Boder: Yes.

00:38:05.395 --> 00:38:12.832
Malka Johles: That is already close to the border. And we were told...we were very afraid to get on the public bus.

00:38:12.832 --> 00:38:13.254
David Boder: Yes.

00:38:13.254 --> 00:38:14.957
Malka Johles: They said that it was dangerous.

00:38:14.957 --> 00:38:18.301

00:38:18.301 --> 00:38:18.910
Malka Johles: Annecy.

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:20.066

Malka Johles: They...they [unintelligible] told him...he said, err, then, err, if somebody had asked him, he would have said, he’s on his way to the hospital to change the bandages...

00:38:32.232 --> 00:38:33.154

Malka Johles: And the children. But...

00:38:39.529 --> 00:38:40.669

Malka Johles: With one child.

00:38:57.886 --> 00:38:58.543
Malka Johles: The other family.

00:38:58.543 --> 00:38:59.464
David Boder: Yes, and then?

00:38:59.464 --> 00:39:02.105
Malka Johles: I didn’t have anything. Only my husband had the...

00:39:02.105 --> 00:39:02.590
David Boder: His papers...

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:14.511

00:39:39.181 --> 00:39:39.993
Malka Johles: My husband said...

00:39:39.993 --> 00:39:41.477
David Boder: A “travel guide”...

00:39:41.477 --> 00:39:48.368
Malka Johles: A...yes. Err, my husband said that he is not afraid, because it...where the guide is, is not far away from St. Julien.

David Boder: To St. Julien.

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:59.368
Malka Johles: To St. Julien. To the hospital. We were afraid and for four days we were in Annecy. Hid in a hotel.

00:39:59.368 --> 00:40:00.556

David Boder: Yes.

00:40:01.776 --> 00:40:19.712
Malka Johles: It’s not far from Annemasse, from the border. And so we didn’t know what to do. The family, that was sent back, had a relative in Annecy. And he sent us, err...somebody, and he recommended that they should give us an ambulance car.

00:40:19.712 --> 00:40:21.805
David Boder: I see! An ambulance.

00:40:21.805 --> 00:40:30.055

David Boder: Yes.

00:40:37.117 --> 00:40:39.867
Malka Johles: And with the child, stayed behind.

David Boder: Yes.

00:40:40.633 --> 00:40:45.908

David Boder: Back.

00:40:46.945 --> 00:40:49.132
Malka Johles: Back. My boy...my boy...

David Boder: Did you meet each other...

00:41:05.827 --> 00:41:07.499
Malka Johles: We had to wait there, after all...

00:41:07.499 --> 00:41:07.999
David Boder: [unintelligible]

00:41:07.999 --> 00:41:19.343
Malka Johles: And my boy got there and tells my husband: why didn’t you, why didn’t you bring Mama with you? And the aunt? Then he says: they were afraid. And by chance! They didn’t check on the bus.

00:41:19.343 --> 00:41:20.124
David Boder: Hmm.

00:41:20.124 --> 00:41:27.921
Malka Johles: Well...good so. So, we paid for the ambu...for the ambulance...You understand?

00:41:27.921 --> 00:41:28.281

David Boder: Yes.

00:41:49.219 --> 00:41:56.739
Malka Johles: He sat on the passenger’s seat, next to the driver. And we waited. The driver already knew...where he needs to...where he would drop the people.

00:41:56.739 --> 00:41:57.442
David Boder: Yes.

00:41:57.442 --> 00:42:05.924

So, he, a poor guy with five or six children. All of a sudden, the car...the car, the ambulance stops. My husband gets off, says: kids, don’t be scared. Something happened.

00:42:31.533 --> 00:42:32.736
David Boder: What happened?

00:42:32.736 --> 00:42:45.874
Malka Johles: (Pause) Don’t be scared. We’re going in. Get out. We’re getting in... there are, err, fifteen...policemen. With the guide in his apartment.

00:42:45.874 --> 00:42:46.530
David Boder: And then?

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:55.326
Malka Johles: It was like this...The bus, err...the policemen arrived earlier and wanted to go to St. Julien...this route...

The woman went inside again, but couldn’t get in anymore... My husband went outside with the [unintelligible]...with the boy on the roof. Then they said, if we’re not coming out right away, they’ll shoot. So, the woman...

00:43:31.168 --> 00:43:32.199
David Boder: They were French policemen?

00:43:32.199 --> 00:43:52.089
Malka Johles: French, yes. And the one policeman...that was a mishap! That just then the bus was late and they were waiting on the bus stop and noticed that something was going on there... So people started to cry. All six children of the passeur [sumuggler]...my husband cried, yes. And the guy had to come off the tree...

David Boder: The policemen...

00:44:28.101 --> 00:44:30.710
Malka Johles: The policemen...Took everything from us, everything we had.

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:31.851
David Boder: Everything one owned [unintelligible]...

00:44:31.851 --> 00:44:35.554
Malka Johles: Yes. And tasteless...everything was given to them. Or else they would have...

00:44:35.554 --> 00:44:36.695
David Boder: What did you give away?

00:44:36.695 --> 00:44:47.461
Malka Johles: The watches, whatever we had. The, the, err [unintelligible]...had, err, a watch. And the woman. Whatever we had. So then they said...the guide said, there is another group coming...

David Boder: Yes, yes.

00:44:48.289 --> 00:44:55.151
Malka Johles: Us! So they said, don’t be scared and they, err...they wished us a good, good...

00:44:55.151 --> 00:44:56.477
David Boder: Journey.

00:44:56.477 --> 00:45:02.752
Malka Johles: Journey. And they saluted us. The, the one guy said, that it’s hard for his mother. We thought, they would go away and report us...

00:45:02.752 --> 00:45:03.518
David Boder: Yes.

00:45:03.518 --> 00:45:09.440
Malka Johles: But they said, you needn’t be afraid. You can stay here until night time, because you can’t cross the border during the day.

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.221
David Boder: Yes.

00:45:10.221 --> 00:45:12.169
Malka Johles: And I was already afraid of staying with the guide.

00:45:12.169 --> 00:45:12.653
David Boder: Yes.

00:45:12.653 --> 00:45:37.653
Malka Johles: You understand, no? Maybe they’ll go outside and, and, err, send another one, err, another policeman. But the one guy said, swore by his mother, that he wouldn’t do that. He’d do nothing. We could sit in peace until night. Until it’s midnight, then we could go. And the guide began also....Because he was, err, Swiss. And he lived in France. They...would have arrested him. Him, too.

00:45:37.653 --> 00:45:38.153
David Boder: Yes.

00:45:38.153 --> 00:45:43.028
Malka Johles: But the guy said: No, he won’t do anything to us. And he left us. Do you understand me?

00:45:43.028 --> 00:45:43.778
David Boder: Yes.

00:45:43.778 --> 00:45:50.090
Malka Johles: And then we should cross over. On the way there, we saw nobody. So, we...

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:52.262
David Boder: How did [unintelligible]...Which way...How long did it take you?

00:45:52.262 --> 00:45:55.074
Malka Johles: Which way...well, four hours....or five hours.

00:45:55.074 --> 00:45:55.918
David Boder: It took four hours!

00:45:55.918 --> 00:45:57.278
Malka Johles: Oh yes! With rain and...

00:45:57.278 --> 00:46:00.184
David Boder: So, it was really on this one way...

00:46:00.184 --> 00:46:02.481
Malka Johles: My husband after his surgery...of course...My husband after his surgery, yes...

00:46:02.481 --> 00:46:04.059
David Boder: Your husband’s hernia was operated on.

00:46:04.059 --> 00:46:08.700
Malka Johles: After the surgery. That had been only, err...one month ago.

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:09.169
David Boder: Yes.

00:46:09.169 --> 00:46:15.700
Malka Johles: Not even one month. On the 22nd we left, it was....[unintelligible]...the same day, after ...[unintelligible].

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:20.980
David Boder: And he...as soon as you had crossed over...[unintelligible]...

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:24.714
Malka Johles: Yes. We had...we came secretly...didn’t see anything.

00:46:24.714 --> 00:46:25.589
David Boder: Yes.

00:46:25.589 --> 00:46:39.182
Malka Johles: Then...we didn’t even know, if we were already on Swiss soil. My husband had a little lamp, a lamp. We were lost for a while. And then we finally....The guide wasn’t allowed to cross the Swi..., err, French border. Or else they would arrest...

00:46:39.182 --> 00:46:39.714
David Boder: Yes.

00:46:39.714 --> 00:46:44.230
Malka Johles: Would have....As a Swiss man, he can’t go back to Switzerland, when he lives in France...

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:44.715
David Boder: Yes.

00:46:44.715 --> 00:46:50.325
Malka Johles: He showed us...so we crossed over the water and he explained a little bit to us...filled us in a little bit...

00:46:50.325 --> 00:46:49.721
David Boder: Hmmm.

00:46:49.721 --> 00:46:58.090
Malka Johles: Of course, once we took a path that would have brought us straight to the Gestapo...We would have come straight to the French...

00:46:58.090 --> 00:46:58.777
David Boder: Well and then? How did you...

00:46:58.777 --> 00:47:01.089
Malka Johles: My husband said, we won’t go down...we’ll go up!

00:47:01.089 --> 00:47:01.714
David Boder: Yes.

00:47:01.714 --> 00:47:08.295
Malka Johles: So we went up...and...indeed, we came...We could already see...a, a, a, French sign....

00:47:08.295 --> 00:47:09.967
David Boder: A ....err, err, Swiss!

00:47:09.967 --> 00:47:12.732
Malka Johles: Yes, a Swiss sign! Then we saw a lit apartment.

00:47:12.732 --> 00:47:13.701
David Boder: Hmm...

00:47:13.701 --> 00:47:41.144
Malka Johles: Light. We rang the doorbell. And out came a man...he says, come in, he says... you are already on the Swiss side. I leave my light on, on purpose, so that, when people come across the border, they can come in. We went in, he [unintelligible]...took out clothes, they were all wet, he prepared a hot bath, gave us coffee and everything. Of course, he dried the clothes a little bit on the stove but in the meantime, he also contacted the police. Some are caught....

00:47:41.144 --> 00:47:43.473
David Boder: Why? Why did he do...?

00:47:43.473 --> 00:47:46.098
Malka Johles: Err, err, he had to...Some, err..

00:47:46.098 --> 00:47:47.707
David Boder: [unintelligible]... Why did he...?

00:47:47.707 --> 00:47:51.800
Malka Johles: [unintelligible]...on the, on the way. We were not caught on the way. We had...could even get to Geneva.

00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:53.769
David Boder: But, who was this man; that he took you in like that?

00:47:53.769 --> 00:47:55.675
Malka Johles: He, a, err, a Swiss man.

00:47:55.675 --> 00:47:57.269
David Boder: Just an individual?

00:47:57.269 --> 00:47:59.738
Malka Johles: Just an individual. But he had to contact the police right away...

00:47:59.738 --> 00:48:00.706
David Boder: Well, that’s clear...

00:48:00.706 --> 00:48:21.674
Malka Johles: The police came right away...the gentleman on a bike. And he said, we should warm up a little bit more and should calm down a bit more. And he would go with us. So we came to the commissariat. In total maybe twenty minutes. He took everything down that we had, papers and a few coins, everything we had. And...

00:48:21.674 --> 00:48:25.033
David Boder: What do you mean by “took”? He wrote it down, no? They didn’t take anything from you.

00:48:25.033 --> 00:48:27.095
Malka Johles: Yes...and that they...gave it back to us.

00:48:27.095 --> 00:48:27.892
David Boder: [unintelligible]

00:48:27.892 --> 00:48:37.032
Malka Johles: But, to this one family they said, that they should give all the shaving things. And then, all of a sudden, he said, the family should take it back again.

00:48:37.032 --> 00:48:37.861
David Boder: Hmm..

00:48:37.861 --> 00:48:47.845
Malka Johles: He said, why, why do you want me to take it again. I’ll give it to you, he says, I’m not afraid, no. But he says: no, take all of your money...and he, unfortunately,...

00:48:47.845 --> 00:48:48.439
David Boder: Send them back.

00:48:48.439 --> 00:48:49.439
Malka Johles: Send them back. Well, you can’t imagine!

00:48:49.439 --> 00:48:50.143
David Boder: With this family?

00:48:50.143 --> 00:48:51.127
Malka Johles: Yes. That is [unintelligible]

00:48:51.127 --> 00:48:51.408

00:48:51.408 --> 00:48:53.830
Malka Johles: Yes. And us...we were there...

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:55.502

Malka Johles: Yes, they were with us in Geneva. Yes.

00:48:57.768 --> 00:49:01.955
David Boder: I see. And finally they were let through.

00:49:01.955 --> 00:49:17.970
Malka Johles: Yes, finally they did get across. So, we came...we were very lucky. Of course, many were caught right on the border. Didn’t matter to us. And this...we registered. We went in there for the families...and the families were called...the police and...they picked us up from there, and then we were there and were there for one day...and then...

00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:23.627
David Boder: Did you meet the people afterwards? Do you know where, who these people are, that took you in?

00:49:23.627 --> 00:49:26.470
