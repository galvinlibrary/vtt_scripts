00:00:44.673 --> 00:00:45.911
David Boder: [In German:] How old are you?

00:00:45.911 --> 00:00:47.016
Alexander Gertner: I’ll soon be twenty.

00:00:47.016 --> 00:00:48.422
David Boder: Twenty.

00:00:48.422 --> 00:00:48.875
Alexander Gertner: I’ll be soon.

00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:52.540
David Boder: [In English:] He is twenty years [old]. He will be twenty next November.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.597
David Boder: [In German:] And so, Mr. Gertner, tell us again your name, Alexander Gertner.

00:00:57.597 --> 00:00:58.593
Alexander Gertner: Alexander Gertner.

00:00:58.593 --> 00:00:59.456
David Boder: And how old are you?

00:00:59.456 --> 00:01:03.078
Alexander Gertner: Born on the 16th of November, ’26...1926.

00:01:03.078 --> 00:01:06.054
David Boder: Yes. And where were you born, Mr. Gertner?

00:01:06.054 --> 00:01:08.728
Alexander Gertner: In Roumania. [Name not clear] is the name of the place...

00:01:08.728 --> 00:01:09.181
David Boder: Yes?

00:01:09.181 --> 00:01:12.730
Alexander Gertner: ...province [of] Maramures [?] in Roumania.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:13.485
David Boder: Roumania?

00:01:13.485 --> 00:01:13.895
Alexander Gertner: Yes.

00:01:13.895 --> 00:01:15.875
David Boder: Write down for me the name of the place.

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:17.402
Alexander Gertner: The place...

00:01:17.402 --> 00:01:20.499
David Boder: And so, Mr. Gertner, you speak Yiddish. Do you want to speak Yiddish or German?

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:21.797
Alexander Gertner: Yiddish, yes, Yiddish.

00:01:21.797 --> 00:01:25.376
David Boder: Yiddish. [In Yiddish:] And so, I want you to tell me everything.

00:01:25.376 --> 00:01:25.497
Alexander Gertner: Yes.

00:01:25.497 --> 00:01:33.302
David Boder: Where you have been when the war started and what happened to you. Make yourself comfortable and start telling.

00:01:33.302 --> 00:01:34.135
Alexander Gertner: From the beginning.

00:01:34.135 --> 00:01:35.300
David Boder: Don’t omit details.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.499
Alexander Gertner: Yes?

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:41.523
David Boder: We want to know everything that happened.

00:01:41.523 --> 00:01:51.942
Alexander Gertner: And so from the beginning. And so in recent times when I...in 1944...1944...[correction] in 1943 I came to Grosswardein [Roumanian name: Oradea], that was a town in Roumania...

00:01:51.942 --> 00:01:52.165
David Boder: Yes?

00:01:52.165 --> 00:02:02.445
Alexander Gertner: There I started learning carpentry. And I was learning there for a few months, and then it came about that I couldn’t learn any more, because there was no stuff...

00:02:02.445 --> 00:02:03.399
David Boder: What does it mean, ‘no stuff’?

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.500
Alexander Gertner: No...no material.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.001
David Boder: Yes?

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:12.478
Alexander Gertner: No material. And so I was compelled...I started learning another trade, glove knitting.

00:02:12.478 --> 00:02:12.888
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:12.888 --> 00:02:21.206
Alexander Gertner: You understand? And that also lasted a few months, and then stopped coming the supplies, the material from Budapest.

00:02:21.206 --> 00:02:21.707
David Boder: Hm.

00:02:21.707 --> 00:02:31.202
Alexander Gertner: So I remained in Grosswardein till 1944, till before Pesach [Jewish Easter]. In 1944 before Pesach I wanted to journey to my parents home in [not clear]...

00:02:31.202 --> 00:02:31.673
David Boder: Yes?

00:02:31.673 --> 00:02:38.271
Alexander Gertner: ...for Pesach. I believed that I would go home eight days before Pesach. Why do I have to go home two weeks before Pesach. Shall I speak louder?

00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:38.832
David Boder: No...

00:02:38.832 --> 00:02:39.134
Alexander Gertner: Yes.

00:02:39.134 --> 00:02:45.412
David Boder: I will tell you. As soon as you see that this [the neon light indicator] lights up now and then, that means it is loud enough. Let’s go on.

00:02:45.412 --> 00:02:45.822
Alexander Gertner: Yes.

00:02:45.822 --> 00:02:46.564
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:46.564 --> 00:02:47.035
Alexander Gertner: Yes.

00:02:47.035 --> 00:02:48.079
David Boder: Go on [?].

00:02:48.079 --> 00:03:00.665
Alexander Gertner: And so I figured on going home only eight days before Pesach, to go home. So eight days, ten days before Pesach the trains were barred for Jews. So Jews were not allowed to travel by trains.

00:03:00.665 --> 00:03:02.234
David Boder: [Clarifying:] On the railroads.

00:03:02.234 --> 00:03:03.079
Alexander Gertner: On the railroads.

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:03.852
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:03.852 --> 00:03:10.963
Alexander Gertner: And so I forgot [to tell you]. On the 5th of March the Germans came [into our town]. On the 5th of March, 1944, the Germans entered.

00:03:10.963 --> 00:03:11.645
David Boder: ’44.

00:03:11.645 --> 00:03:16.522
Alexander Gertner: Yes, ’44, and we began right away wearing yellow stars.

00:03:16.522 --> 00:03:16.945
David Boder: Yellow patches.

00:03:16.945 --> 00:03:18.170
Alexander Gertner: Yellow patches.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.046
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:19.046 --> 00:03:32.193
Alexander Gertner: And...and so before Pesach I wanted to go home. One couldn’t. And after Pesach...and so I had to remain in Grosswardein. Right after Pesach, two weeks after Pesach, they began to assemble the Ghetto. And the Ghetto lasted [words not clear].

00:03:32.193 --> 00:03:33.599
David Boder: So you did not go home?

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:42.050
Alexander Gertner: No. I remained in there. The parents wanted me home, and the mother and the father, because they weren’t in the same place, and I wanted to go home, and I couldn’t any more.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.448
David Boder: Why...why weren’t your father and mother in the same place?

00:03:45.448 --> 00:03:48.449
Alexander Gertner: Because they lived in that place where I was born, understand?

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.726
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:48.726 --> 00:03:51.038
Alexander Gertner: And I went to [name not clear] to live there.

00:03:51.038 --> 00:03:53.501
David Boder: Nu, but your father and mother lived together?

00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:53.893
Alexander Gertner: Yes.

00:03:53.893 --> 00:03:55.692
David Boder: Oh, yes. Do you have any brothers and sisters?

00:03:55.692 --> 00:03:58.125
Alexander Gertner: No. I had one sister, younger than I.

00:03:58.125 --> 00:03:59.260
David Boder: Nu?

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.670
Alexander Gertner: And so...

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.559
David Boder: Why do you say you ‘had’?

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:02.802
Alexander Gertner: I don’t know whether she is alive.

00:04:02.802 --> 00:04:03.275
David Boder: [Words not clear.]

00:04:03.275 --> 00:04:05.589
Alexander Gertner: I am ninety per cent certain, alas, that she isn’t.

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:06.505
David Boder: And about your parents?

00:04:06.505 --> 00:04:07.825
Alexander Gertner: Also. Even more [certain].

00:04:07.825 --> 00:04:12.189
David Boder: Hm. Nu, and so you couldn’t go back.

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:24.038
Alexander Gertner: No. And so I remained in Grosswardein in the Ghetto. It was...the Ghetto was assembled two weeks after Pesach. It took four days till the Ghetto was built. It was shut. Nobody could go out, out of the house, and...

00:04:24.038 --> 00:04:25.444
David Boder: There in the little town?

00:04:25.444 --> 00:04:29.096
Alexander Gertner: No, Grosswardein was a bigger town of about a hundred and twenty thousand inhabitants.

00:04:29.096 --> 00:04:30.925
David Boder: Write down for me the name of the town.

00:04:30.925 --> 00:04:33.146
Alexander Gertner: Grosswardein.

00:04:33.146 --> 00:04:34.794
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:04:34.794 --> 00:04:41.814
Alexander Gertner: And the Ghetto began to be built. I have...I remained in a house there where I lived...well, in my room.

00:04:41.814 --> 00:04:42.206
David Boder: Hm.

00:04:42.206 --> 00:05:07.685
Alexander Gertner: And I...I didn’t have anything to eat, because I was not prepared [did not stock up]. I wanted in the morning to go to work like always at five o’clock. I got up to go for prayer and from there straight to work. So I got up. I see police already standing in the...every ten meters on the street, and the policeman tells me, ‘Shut the door again, and go back into the house.’ And so four days I was shut in the house. I couldn’t go out. We nearly died of hunger. And so then we were permitted to go out. Later already was...

00:05:07.685 --> 00:05:10.359
David Boder: And so four days you were in the house.

00:05:10.359 --> 00:05:10.751
Alexander Gertner: Yes.

00:05:10.751 --> 00:05:12.248
David Boder: With whom were you in there?

00:05:12.248 --> 00:05:14.469
Alexander Gertner: I was alone, because I lived privately [by myself]...

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.650
David Boder: Nu?

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:21.730
Alexander Gertner: ...in a room. Well, there were Jews there in the house, but every body thought about himself, but yet one did help out another.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.076
David Boder: You got something to eat?

00:05:23.076 --> 00:05:25.068
Alexander Gertner: Nothing special, but one could get something.

00:05:25.068 --> 00:05:25.943
David Boder: Nu?

00:05:25.943 --> 00:05:37.551
Alexander Gertner: Very little, you can imagine. And then after the four days was Saturday. I wanted to go out to....I had relatives there in Grosswardein. I wanted to go out to my relatives. So I was instantly caught to work. I didn’t even have time...

00:05:37.551 --> 00:05:38.342
David Boder: The Germans caught you to work?

00:05:38.342 --> 00:06:12.616
Alexander Gertner: The Germans caught [people] on the street to work. I was brought to a...to a...to a food factory. There we had to unload wagons with potatoes and German clothing in to a storehouse. I unloaded the same, and it lasted till the evening. We didn’t eat anything since the morning, and in the evening a pot of potatoes was cooked for us, and we were given it. That was the...till the evening. In the evening there arrived the SS superior group leader [an officer]. He saw that the work wasn’t finished yet. He began to throw around the potatoes and [he] wanted to devour everybody. And so...so the Ghetto...

00:06:12.616 --> 00:06:15.833
David Boder: And so from this work, where did you go?

00:06:15.833 --> 00:06:22.715
Alexander Gertner: Went back to the relatives. I didn’t go back to the old place where I lived, on that street. I went back to my relatives, and I have...

00:06:22.715 --> 00:06:24.333
David Boder: Your relatives lived in the Ghetto?

00:06:24.333 --> 00:06:25.347
Alexander Gertner: Oh, yes, they lived in the Ghetto.

00:06:25.347 --> 00:06:25.770
David Boder: Hm.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.233
Alexander Gertner: And so I went there to eat something [?]. From the Ghetto...

00:06:28.233 --> 00:06:32.295
David Boder: Excuse me. Tell me, how is a Ghetto made? How did they make the Ghetto?

00:06:32.295 --> 00:06:59.746
Alexander Gertner: How they made the Ghetto? First they made a plan. There were in the town thirty thousand Jews. They made a plan. All Jews should...for instance, in...in the Jewish region they intended to blockade all the streets. They blockaded, and they told the Gentiles to move out of these streets, and the streets were barricaded with boards two meters high, and all the Jews from the whole town were sent into...into these few streets. And even from the surrounding towns the Jews were brought...who lived in the surrounding towns were brought in.

00:06:59.746 --> 00:07:04.183
David Boder: And who decided where one was going to live?

00:07:04.183 --> 00:07:05.378
Alexander Gertner: The Germans. Everything [by] the Germans.

00:07:05.378 --> 00:07:05.891
David Boder: The Germans.

00:07:05.891 --> 00:07:06.253
Alexander Gertner: Yes.

00:07:06.253 --> 00:07:09.018
David Boder: Did they say, ‘You go in here, and you go in there?’

00:07:09.018 --> 00:07:12.326
Alexander Gertner: No. They said here the Jews have to live, on this piece of ground.

00:07:12.326 --> 00:07:13.068
David Boder: All right, but...

00:07:13.068 --> 00:07:20.118
Alexander Gertner: All the Jews were sent in. The Germans brought [them] with trucks. The whole town was sent in by trucks, thrown into the Ghetto, on this piece of ground.

00:07:20.118 --> 00:07:20.981
David Boder: On the few streets.

00:07:20.981 --> 00:07:30.367
Alexander Gertner: Yes. Now then...yes. And everyone...among us there were already appointed Jewish police and all kinds of different...Hungarian police. [Word not clear] it is called in Hungarian.

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:30.699
David Boder: Yes?

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:41.552
Alexander Gertner: And then they pushed in....In one house has to be...in one room had to be nine people, in one room of twelve meters. No, well, in one room of...in a bigger room nine people had to live.

00:07:41.552 --> 00:07:43.091
David Boder: Let’s take a room like this.

00:07:43.091 --> 00:07:46.429
Alexander Gertner: In a room like this approximately twenty people had to live.

00:07:46.429 --> 00:07:50.896
David Boder: How big do you think this room is? How many meters square are here?

00:07:50.896 --> 00:07:56.860
Alexander Gertner: In this room? Approximately eight by eight, eight by nine.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:01.194
David Boder: Eight by nine. And so in a room eight by nine approximately how many had to live?

00:08:01.194 --> 00:08:03.005
Alexander Gertner: Twenty to twenty-five people had to live.

00:08:03.005 --> 00:08:03.566
David Boder: People...

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:03.813
Alexander Gertner: Yes.

00:08:03.813 --> 00:08:04.755
David Boder: How, men and women...

00:08:04.755 --> 00:08:10.626
Alexander Gertner: Men and wives together with children, everything. They were thrown together with the things, with all the belongings that they possessed.

00:08:10.626 --> 00:08:11.429
David Boder: The policemen did that?

00:08:11.429 --> 00:08:57.043
Alexander Gertner: The policemen, yes. And then one did...the...the Ghetto...When they began to move them in trucks, they were thrown on the streets. And then, when all those people were already in the Ghetto, he began to distribute everybody. In this house live so many. In this house....One was missing a child. One was missing a sack with things. One was missing that. One was missing that. It was a calamity! And everybody was on guard, because the grabbed for work on various things, in various places. And we...then when we had been already distributed, we already were pushed together. I lived with my relatives. There I lived. Then everybody was allotted....The food in the Ghetto consisted of a fifth...it was twenty-five dekas of bread. That is...how much is that in grams? Twenty-five dekagrams of bread and a liter of soup.

00:08:57.043 --> 00:08:58.208
David Boder: Two hundred and fifty grams.

00:08:58.208 --> 00:09:07.238
Alexander Gertner: Two hundred and fifty grams and...heavy bread. It was heavy bread [of inferior flour badly baked], and there was a liter of soup at dinner time — sometimes even a little more, and in the morning black coffee, but no sugar.

00:09:07.238 --> 00:09:13.202
David Boder: Now wait a moment. Wait a moment. You say ‘a liter of soup.’ Did everybody go from home to the...

00:09:13.202 --> 00:09:22.546
Alexander Gertner: No. One [person] went from a house. For instance, from a family that had five people it was said...it was recorded that every family has so many, and he was given for so many.

00:09:22.546 --> 00:09:23.301
David Boder: So many liters of soup.

00:09:23.301 --> 00:09:23.561
Alexander Gertner: Yes.

00:09:23.561 --> 00:09:24.756
David Boder: Where was it cooked?

00:09:24.756 --> 00:09:31.245
Alexander Gertner: There was a field kitchen. At first there was one big field kitchen. Then it was seen that it was not enough. There were four, five kitchens established.

00:09:31.245 --> 00:09:32.531
David Boder: You have a tattoo number...

00:09:32.531 --> 00:09:32.821
Alexander Gertner: Yes.

00:09:32.821 --> 00:09:33.473
David Boder: What is the number?

00:09:33.473 --> 00:09:36.238
Alexander Gertner: Twelve thousand two hundred sixty-nine [12,269].

00:09:36.238 --> 00:09:38.640
David Boder: And the letter ‘A.’ ‘A,’ what is it for?

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:46.759
Alexander Gertner: ‘A’? It began...it was like this. At first it was made till two hundred [two hundred thousand?], and then they completed two hundred. So they began again from one, and the made an ‘A’ [possibly a triangle].

00:09:46.759 --> 00:09:48.497
David Boder: Hm. All right.

00:09:48.497 --> 00:09:49.131
Alexander Gertner: You understand?

00:09:49.131 --> 00:09:49.524
David Boder: Yes.

00:09:49.524 --> 00:10:03.848
Alexander Gertner: And then...I want to continue...So dinner was distributed in the Ghetto. A little soup was given. It was only watter. And we who had [something] added a little cooking at home, and whoever didn’t...So the Ghetto lasted four...

00:10:03.848 --> 00:10:04.983
David Boder: [Whisper about the tattoo.]

00:10:04.983 --> 00:10:07.470
Alexander Gertner: The number six is already worn off. It was like this...

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:08.532
David Boder: Why is it worn off?

00:10:08.532 --> 00:10:09.812
Alexander Gertner: It came about by itself.

00:10:09.812 --> 00:10:09.963
David Boder: Yes.

00:10:09.963 --> 00:10:11.369
Alexander Gertner: It wasn’t written well at the beginning...

00:10:11.369 --> 00:10:11.641
David Boder: Yes.

00:10:11.641 --> 00:10:12.233
Alexander Gertner: ...because it was done quickly.

00:10:12.233 --> 00:10:13.066
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:10:13.066 --> 00:10:15.800
Alexander Gertner: [Words not clear.]

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.128
David Boder: Sixty-nine or sixty-five?

00:10:17.128 --> 00:10:17.961
Alexander Gertner: Sixty-nine.

00:10:17.961 --> 00:10:20.605
David Boder: Hm, nu? And so?

00:10:20.605 --> 00:10:37.492
Alexander Gertner: And so we...and everybody was given the little food. The Ghetto became thus. During the time of the Ghetto everybody had to work. They caught young boys and also girls. We had to work hard. For instance, in a bakery that was there, we had to carry eighty-five-kilo sacks to the second floor [in Europe the third.] Boys came home with lung infections, with shooting pains, with different [word not clear].

00:10:37.492 --> 00:10:39.695
David Boder: [Word not clear.] What?

00:10:39.695 --> 00:10:44.283
Alexander Gertner: With diseases boys came home, from carrying the heavy sacks to the second floor.

00:10:44.283 --> 00:10:44.619
David Boder: Nu?

00:10:44.619 --> 00:10:45.319
Alexander Gertner: You understand?

00:10:45.319 --> 00:10:45.661
David Boder: Yes.

00:10:45.661 --> 00:11:08.042
Alexander Gertner: And then the Ghetto played [existed] like this for four weeks. One was grabbed, one was beaten at work, and we didn’t know what was happening. And then in the Ghetto was installed in the large Beth Hamidrosh [an annex of the synagogue; term also used synonimously with synagogue]....There was a [word not clear] Beth Hamidrosh in Grosswardein in the synagogue. It was vacated. All the things that were in there were thrown out, and it was made into a Ghetto...a Jewish...a Ghetto hospital.

00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:09.298
David Boder: [In German:] A Ghetto hospital?

00:11:09.298 --> 00:11:10.282
Alexander Gertner: A Ghetto hospital.

00:11:10.282 --> 00:11:11.206
David Boder: [In Yiddish:] Who did that?

00:11:11.206 --> 00:11:15.631
Alexander Gertner: That was made...that was ordered by the Germans. It was made by the Jews themselves...it was made.

00:11:15.631 --> 00:11:16.072
David Boder: Why?

00:11:16.072 --> 00:11:16.996
Alexander Gertner: They had to. It was ordered.

00:11:16.996 --> 00:11:17.376
David Boder: Nu?

00:11:17.376 --> 00:11:20.020
Alexander Gertner: There were so many sick that we didn’t know where to put the sick.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.483
David Boder: Were you allowed to carry out the Sefer Torahs [the Holy Scrolls]?

00:11:22.483 --> 00:11:24.372
Alexander Gertner: Yes. We had to, not that we were just allowed.

00:11:24.372 --> 00:11:26.261
David Boder: But yes, but they weren’t thrown out.

00:11:26.261 --> 00:12:25.961
Alexander Gertner: No, they were carried out. We received the order. And then we have...they threw into the hospital....The synagogue annex was very big. People were carried in there who had wasted away [?]. Nobody paid attention to a person. Surely there were Jewish doctors. They were, of course, their people. One didn’t know what to do. They [the Germans] didn’t give any medicaments. They didn’t give any supplies with which to treat. One held out. One, two, on the third day he was already dead. My...my uncle also lay there with pneumonia, usually a light illness. Then he developed pleurisy. He did not receive any care. Then he caught pleurisy, and so with the pleurisy he came to Auschwitz. And, of course, you know what happened there. And like this it was. And so the Ghetto lived thus for four weeks. And then began the deportations. It was on the second day, well, a day after Shevuoth [the Feast of the Tabernacles] in ’44. It started on the 1st of June....No, on the 1st of June I went...it means approximately on the 6th, on the 25th of May.

00:12:25.961 --> 00:12:28.285
David Boder: Hm.

00:12:28.285 --> 00:12:32.166
Alexander Gertner: They began to send transports. The first transport took place on the Saturday after the Feast of the Tabernacles.

00:12:32.166 --> 00:12:32.951
David Boder: Hm.

00:12:32.951 --> 00:12:35.504
Alexander Gertner: Then, after the first transport was sent away...

00:12:35.504 --> 00:12:40.031
David Boder: Now wait a moment. How was the first transport selected? How was the transport assembled?

00:12:40.031 --> 00:12:47.142
Alexander Gertner: It was done like this. One street was taken in the morning, a certain street. It was arranged that every street had a number, a district number.

00:12:47.142 --> 00:12:47.794
David Boder: Hm. Yes.

00:12:47.794 --> 00:12:51.947
Alexander Gertner: The first street was taken, for instance, Kopetino [?] Street, and Khotin [?] Street, which were there.

00:12:51.947 --> 00:12:52.267
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:52.267 --> 00:12:58.170
Alexander Gertner: These [streets] were taken. There were three thousand people. They were loaded into wagons [RR-cars], and they were taken away.

00:12:58.170 --> 00:12:58.774
David Boder: Men, women, and children?

00:12:58.774 --> 00:13:00.301
Alexander Gertner: Men, women, children, everything.

00:13:00.301 --> 00:13:02.353
David Boder: Those who could work, also?

00:13:02.353 --> 00:13:04.889
Alexander Gertner: Did not matter. Everything, everything. From young to old.

00:13:04.889 --> 00:13:05.450
David Boder: Nu?

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:06.404
Alexander Gertner: Sick people, too.

00:13:06.404 --> 00:13:07.720
David Boder: And where were they transported to?

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.481
Alexander Gertner: They...we were told that we are taken ito deep Hungary to a lager.

00:13:11.481 --> 00:13:13.491
David Boder: You were on that transport?

00:13:13.491 --> 00:13:14.777
Alexander Gertner: We were told so [?].

00:13:14.777 --> 00:13:14.976
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:14.976 --> 00:13:20.215
Alexander Gertner: And then we were....Where they were taken to, one knows — to Auschwitz. To Auschwitz we were taken. I, too, went there.

00:13:20.215 --> 00:13:20.578
David Boder: Nu?

00:13:20.578 --> 00:13:34.551
Alexander Gertner: And then we came...and so it was. The first transport was taken away. I was caught to work. It was on the first day of Saturday [obviously Shevouth]. In the houses from which the Jews were taken away the SS have...the Hungarian gendarmes...the gendarmerie...

00:13:34.551 --> 00:13:36.712
David Boder: You said you were born in Roumania?

00:13:36.712 --> 00:13:40.249
Alexander Gertner: Yes, but in the year ’40 we were handed over by the Germans [?]—I forgot to tell you — to Hungary. You surely heard about it.

00:13:40.249 --> 00:13:41.165
David Boder: Yes, well...

00:13:41.165 --> 00:13:43.038
Alexander Gertner: The district of [?] Transylvania...

00:13:43.038 --> 00:13:43.227
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:43.227 --> 00:13:46.104
Alexander Gertner: ...was occupied by Hungary in the year ’40, in September.

00:13:46.104 --> 00:13:46.306
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:46.306 --> 00:13:47.590
Alexander Gertner: You surely heard about it.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:48.401
David Boder: Yes, yes, yes. Nu?

00:13:48.401 --> 00:13:52.192
Alexander Gertner: And I was born as a Roumanian and went to a Roumanian school.

00:13:52.192 --> 00:13:53.568
David Boder: And then you became a Hungarian.

00:13:53.568 --> 00:13:58.657
Alexander Gertner: Became....The Hungarians handed us over to Auschwitz, because the Roumanians did not hand any Jews over to Auschwitz.

00:13:58.657 --> 00:14:00.353
David Boder: Oh! The Roumanians did not hand over the Jews?

00:14:00.353 --> 00:14:07.977
Alexander Gertner: No. The Roumanians did not. They gave them trouble [harrasments] in the country. Jews were killed off there and slaughtered and sent to Dniestr, but directly to Auschwitz in transports...

00:14:07.977 --> 00:14:09.263
David Boder: Where did you say they were sent to?

00:14:09.263 --> 00:14:11.092
Alexander Gertner: To Dniestr. There to the Ukraine.

00:14:11.092 --> 00:14:11.412
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:11.412 --> 00:14:12.215
Alexander Gertner: To Dniestr.

00:14:12.215 --> 00:14:12.716
David Boder: To Dniestr.

00:14:12.716 --> 00:14:13.108
Alexander Gertner: Yes.

00:14:13.108 --> 00:14:14.665
David Boder: But you were not handed over to Auschwitz.

00:14:14.665 --> 00:14:18.033
Alexander Gertner: No direct transports like in Hungary, where they took from young to old on a transport.

00:14:18.033 --> 00:14:18.184
David Boder: Hm.

00:14:18.184 --> 00:14:19.555
Alexander Gertner: The people were not taken in Roumania.

00:14:19.555 --> 00:14:19.845
David Boder: Hm.

00:14:19.845 --> 00:14:20.316
Alexander Gertner: Only in Hungary.

00:14:20.316 --> 00:14:23.111
David Boder: And so you were taken to work after the first transport.

00:14:23.111 --> 00:14:44.497
Alexander Gertner: No. I was taken directly to these houses to remove the furnishings. I saw that there are in these houses Prayer Shawls, Phylacteries. Everything was strewn about. I pictured to myself how it must be [now] in our house, too. And so the transports went in this manner. There were six transports: Saturday the first, then Sunday, Monday, Tuesday...on Tuesday there did not depart a transport, so we already thought that...that...

00:14:44.497 --> 00:14:45.041
David Boder: That it will be enough.

00:14:45.041 --> 00:15:36.369
Alexander Gertner: That it will be enough. In the meantime there were no wagons [available]. Next day they took again. Wednesday I came into transp-...my turn [came], that is, I and my housemates [?]. And so we were taken on a transport and quickly....We didn’t know anything on the evening [before] that tomorrow we are going on a transport, because we knew that another district was going. In the morning comes in the...the gendarmerie, the Hungarian, and yell, ‘Quick, in half an hour everybody has to be with his bundles in the street.’ And my...my aunt begins to cry. The uncle lies in the hospital sick, helpless. And she has to go away, and the hospital still remains. And so, well, he didn’t...she was not permitted to take leave of him. And so we came. We stood in the street, five in a row, and then suddenly they counted up, counted up. Right before us it stopped. Thus there were already enough. Three thousand could only be taken at one time. And we remained behind, two hundred and fifty people. We remained behind, because it was...we could not be taken any more on this transport.

00:15:36.369 --> 00:15:37.715
David Boder: And your aunt also remained behind?

00:15:37.715 --> 00:15:46.105
Alexander Gertner: Yes. My aunt and my uncle, and another friend, too. And then we were taken into the synagogue annex. There was a big synagogue annex.

00:15:46.105 --> 00:15:48.309
David Boder: [Words not clear.]

00:15:48.309 --> 00:15:49.142
Alexander Gertner: Yes.

00:15:49.142 --> 00:15:50.367
David Boder: So three thousand were taken.

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:58.848
Alexander Gertner: Three thousand. They took more, because they did not know how many were in the district [?]. So they counted off the three thousand, and two hundred and fifty remained. There were too many.

00:15:58.848 --> 00:15:59.077
David Boder: Nu?

00:15:59.077 --> 00:16:09.628
Alexander Gertner: We were brought back. We were brought into that house. We were locked in the big synagogue. There was a big, [word not clear] synagogue. We were locked in. We were not permitted to go out [words not clear].

00:16:09.628 --> 00:16:10.111
David Boder: Nu?

00:16:10.111 --> 00:16:21.097
Alexander Gertner: And there we were brought something to eat from the kitchen. They admitted it [the food], barely admitted it. We had to stay there overnight. You can imagine! Two hundred and fifty people had to stay there overnight on the benches, and...

00:16:21.097 --> 00:16:21.809
David Boder: Women and children?

00:16:21.809 --> 00:16:38.759
Alexander Gertner: Women and children and old and sick. It was a...a...and then in the morning exactly at five arrived a transport of gendarmerie, the Hungarians, who took us to fall in also in fives, and we were again...we were taken to the wagons.

00:16:38.759 --> 00:16:40.135
David Boder: Well, you said that you...

00:16:40.135 --> 00:16:41.813
Alexander Gertner: Already the next day...the next day...already on Thursday.

00:16:41.813 --> 00:16:45.604
David Boder: Oh! So you were spared it only for one day.

00:16:45.604 --> 00:16:46.014
Alexander Gertner: What?

00:16:46.014 --> 00:16:51.646
David Boder: For one...your deportation was put off for one day. For one day.

00:16:51.646 --> 00:16:54.320
Alexander Gertner: No. We have...we went away Wednesday.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:54.592
David Boder: Yes?

00:16:54.592 --> 00:16:57.930
Alexander Gertner: In the meantime there were too many, so we were sent away Thursday.

00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:58.370
David Boder: Nu, nu?

00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:58.974
Alexander Gertner: You understand?

00:16:58.974 --> 00:16:59.584
David Boder: Nu?

00:16:59.584 --> 00:17:04.892
Alexander Gertner: And then in turn [?] on Thursday morning we were taken again and led to the trains. We were taken. There already stood...

00:17:04.892 --> 00:17:05.854
David Boder: [In German:] To the rainroad.

00:17:05.854 --> 00:17:06.657
Alexander Gertner: The railroad.

00:17:06.657 --> 00:17:07.913
David Boder: Were there other people?

00:17:07.913 --> 00:17:10.466
Alexander Gertner: Other...well, crowds of people behind us.

00:17:10.466 --> 00:17:10.557
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:10.557 --> 00:17:13.028
Alexander Gertner: We were the first, becasue we were the rest from yesterday.

00:17:13.028 --> 00:17:13.233
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:13.233 --> 00:17:35.253
Alexander Gertner: You understand? We were taken right away to the wagons. There we already saw whole [many] wagons were standing, maybe dozens [?] of wagons. And the SS distrubute [the people into] the wagons. There was a superior group leader with a few SS officers. They counted up the [people for the] wagons, and they did....I went into the first wagon. We were counted off eighty people, and...and we went into the wagon.

00:17:35.253 --> 00:17:37.082
David Boder: What kind of wagons were they?

00:17:37.082 --> 00:17:39.243
Alexander Gertner: They were freight wagons...

00:17:39.243 --> 00:17:39.442
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:39.442 --> 00:17:41.301
Alexander Gertner: ...used for transportation of cattle.

00:17:41.301 --> 00:17:42.448
David Boder: A freight wagon.

00:17:42.448 --> 00:17:43.673
Alexander Gertner: Freight wagon, freight wagons.

00:17:43.673 --> 00:17:44.156
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:44.156 --> 00:17:57.756
Alexander Gertner: They were small wagons. We entered eighty, eighty-five people into one wagon, and we were locked in. They said, ‘Who is missing...if one will be missing, then the whole wagon will be shot.’ So said the Hungarian gendarmerie. They said that.

00:17:57.756 --> 00:17:58.348
David Boder: Hm.

00:17:58.348 --> 00:18:04.221
Alexander Gertner: And then someone was made the leader of the wagon. He should supervise.

00:18:04.221 --> 00:18:04.903
David Boder: A Jew?

00:18:04.903 --> 00:18:06.744
Alexander Gertner: Also a Jew. There were only Jews there.

00:18:06.744 --> 00:18:07.185
David Boder: Yes.

00:18:07.185 --> 00:18:12.062
Alexander Gertner: And we were locked in there. On Thursday at twelve o’clock...

00:18:12.062 --> 00:18:14.736
David Boder: You were there with whom?

00:18:14.736 --> 00:18:24.303
Alexander Gertner: I was...by accident I was able to be with my...with my relatives, [word not clear] only with the aunt, because the uncle remained in the hospital. She alone—the others were thrown into another wagon. One couldn’t choose.

00:18:24.303 --> 00:18:24.998
David Boder: Hm.

00:18:24.998 --> 00:18:37.511
Alexander Gertner: We remained there with strangers, such from the same city, acquantainces. And eighty people in a wagon, a small wagon. For the whole wagon was...was...was allotted a jar of water, and a half a bread to each.

00:18:37.511 --> 00:18:37.813
David Boder: Hm.

00:18:37.813 --> 00:18:42.871
Alexander Gertner: A small piece [?] of black bread. This was for the whole journey, and we had nothing prepared [?].

00:18:42.871 --> 00:18:44.549
David Boder: Were you told where you were being taken?

00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:51.702
Alexander Gertner: We were told nothing. Absolutely nothing was said. The train started moving Thursday noon at twelve o’clock, and we went...

00:18:51.702 --> 00:18:53.169
David Boder: Nu, a convenience...

00:18:53.169 --> 00:18:54.243
Alexander Gertner: There was nothing.

00:18:54.243 --> 00:18:54.835
David Boder: ...a toilet.

00:18:54.835 --> 00:19:01.493
Alexander Gertner: There were in the wagons absolutely no toilets. Absolutely nothing. It was...we went out [releaved ourselves] ...one...it was...impossible to tell.

00:19:01.493 --> 00:19:04.107
David Boder: Tell it...how was it?

00:19:04.107 --> 00:19:17.163
Alexander Gertner: We went out. We had containers or such. We poured it out through the window. One saw another...we couldn’t...we took a dress, covered there a corner of the wagon and there. When one came out another went in. So in a line...

00:19:17.163 --> 00:19:17.375
David Boder: Hm.

00:19:17.375 --> 00:19:20.109
Alexander Gertner: We didn’t have any water to wash one’s self and such.

00:19:20.109 --> 00:19:24.654
David Boder: Hm. One made it on the [in English:] floor...[in German:] on the floor?

00:19:24.654 --> 00:19:42.811
Alexander Gertner: Right on the floor. The children screamed. They had no water, and the...on the first day there was still water that had been given, and we could [get] a little on the way. And then on the second day there was absolutely no water. The children—it was a pity—the children cried. The parents did not drink any water so that it should remain for the children.

00:19:42.811 --> 00:19:43.855
David Boder: Hm.

00:19:43.855 --> 00:19:49.789
Alexander Gertner: So we journeyed for four days and four nights till...till Sunday evening.

00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:51.075
David Boder: Yes. Where did you come to?

00:19:51.075 --> 00:19:55.228
Alexander Gertner: Sunday evening we came to...to Birkenau, to Auschwitz. This is near Auschwitz.

00:19:55.228 --> 00:19:56.755
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:56.755 --> 00:20:02.658
Alexander Gertner: And so in the wagons was...we thought we shall perish from thirst. There were terrible heat spells then, and...

00:20:02.658 --> 00:20:04.879
David Boder: Just a moment. [Words not clear.]

00:20:04.879 --> 00:20:09.039
Alexander Gertner: Yes. It was terribly hot, and the wagons were closed...

00:20:09.039 --> 00:20:10.761
David Boder: When was it? In June or May?

00:20:10.761 --> 00:20:12.293
Alexander Gertner: June. The first of June.

00:20:12.293 --> 00:20:13.795
David Boder: The first of June. Nu?

00:20:13.795 --> 00:20:26.626
Alexander Gertner: We couldn’t stand it. We said, ‘If we go another night, then...’ We were all undressed, naked, only in the trousers, because of the heat. We arrived on the first of June. We arrived at...

00:20:26.626 --> 00:20:28.037
David Boder: Nu?

00:20:28.037 --> 00:20:30.324
Alexander Gertner: On the first of June we arrived in Auschwitz.

00:20:30.324 --> 00:20:30.505
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:30.505 --> 00:20:54.835
Alexander Gertner: Birkenau it is called. Auschwitz one could...but Birkenau was the extermination camp. And there we detrained. And so says...says my aunt, ‘Do they take away the things?’ All the things which we had brought. So one there says, ...There were other Jews, Polish, who had unloaded us, who had been in the lager a long time, who cleaned out the RR-cars. They said, ‘The soul is taken away, too, not only the things!’

00:20:54.835 --> 00:20:55.288
David Boder: Nu.

00:20:55.288 --> 00:21:21.975
Alexander Gertner: We went down...we were immediately, right away, told to fall in fives, men separately and women separately. We couldn’t...I didn’t even have time to bid good bye to the relatives, to the friends. We were told to hurry. The SS were standing. We were lined up by the SS [?]. We were ordered to fall in. First the women fell in and then the men. We fell in. There was standing an SS chief doctor and was showing with his finger: left and right, left and right.

00:21:21.975 --> 00:21:23.718
David Boder: Why did he point? What did it mean?

00:21:23.718 --> 00:21:38.603
Alexander Gertner: Those...those whose face he saw looked young and was healthy for work, that he can work...some he asked, ‘How old are you?’ One...seldom he asked the age...if he was in doubt. And left [he pointed] when he was old [?]. Right away he said, ‘Left, right, left, right.’

00:21:38.603 --> 00:21:39.117
David Boder: Nu?

00:21:39.117 --> 00:21:55.603
Alexander Gertner: And those...those on the left, about those, we know where they went. They went into the gas chamber right away. And we, the others, went to bathe. We were taken away to...we were sorted out. From such a transport there could have been sorted out approximately two hundred to two hundred and fifty men.

00:21:55.603 --> 00:21:58.555
David Boder: One couldn’t see the crematories in Birkenau? In Birkenau...

00:21:58.555 --> 00:22:02.353
Alexander Gertner: Yes. In Birkenau were the crematories. There we saw them. It was so...

00:22:02.353 --> 00:22:03.855
David Boder: Where were you? In Auschwitz or Birkenau?

00:22:03.855 --> 00:22:06.051
Alexander Gertner: In Birkenau. In Auschwitz there were no crematories.

00:22:06.051 --> 00:22:07.553
David Boder: Yes?

00:22:07.553 --> 00:22:11.653
Alexander Gertner: And so, it was so. When we came there were arriving many transports, because they hurried...

00:22:11.653 --> 00:22:11.985
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:11.985 --> 00:22:15.761
Alexander Gertner: There arrived in a day fifteen thousand to twenty thousand people.

00:22:15.761 --> 00:22:16.326
David Boder: Yes?

00:22:16.326 --> 00:22:26.498
Alexander Gertner: They arrived...they did not have time to burn them in the crematories, because in a crematory went thirty-six people [at one time]. There were thirty-six...[correction] six crematories. In a crematory were six ovens.

00:22:26.498 --> 00:22:26.770
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:36.368
Alexander Gertner: In every oven one man. So in a few minutes thirty-six people could burn. That means that in six crematories could [be burned] a few hundred people in a few minutes. That is not...but this was not enough.

00:22:36.368 --> 00:22:36.731
David Boder: Nu?

00:22:36.731 --> 00:22:40.317
Alexander Gertner: Because so many people were arriving. So they took, in the forest...There was a forest there.

00:22:40.317 --> 00:22:40.589
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:40.589 --> 00:22:43.178
Alexander Gertner: They took and made pits.

00:22:43.178 --> 00:22:43.298
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:43.298 --> 00:22:49.226
Alexander Gertner: These were dug out and wood was packed in. And when the people were brought out from the gas chamber...

00:22:49.226 --> 00:22:49.498
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:49.498 --> 00:22:51.378
Alexander Gertner: And so all the people had been gassed.

00:22:51.378 --> 00:22:52.345
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:52.345 --> 00:23:07.774
Alexander Gertner: They were still alive, because in eight minutes one can still...one still had the soul in him [was still alive]. They were immediately transported in RR-cars from the gas chamber, when taken out from there [?], and right away in RR-cars the people were sent over to the pits. The people were thrown in there, more wood was thrown on top, and fire set to it. And we were...

00:23:07.774 --> 00:23:09.043
David Boder: With what was it lit?

00:23:09.043 --> 00:23:10.575
Alexander Gertner: Probably with gasoline.

00:23:10.575 --> 00:23:11.654
David Boder: Did you see it?

00:23:11.654 --> 00:23:31.282
Alexander Gertner: Yes. The flames were seen. So we asked, ‘What are the flames there?’ This we saw first when we didn’t know anything about the crematories. So we asked, ‘What are the flames?’ So we were told by the others who had been there. They said, ‘The old things are being burned that people brought along.’ And then a day later we found out about the flames. We...we felt the stench. We didn’t know what it was...

00:23:31.282 --> 00:23:31.826
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:31.826 --> 00:23:44.077
Alexander Gertner: ...what was stinking. And so we were led — I know what happened — to the others [?]. And we were taken, the two hundred men. We were led into a bathhouse on the other side. Going on the road...

00:23:44.077 --> 00:23:45.790
David Boder: How old were you then?

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:47.926
Alexander Gertner: Then? It was two years ago.

00:23:47.926 --> 00:23:48.107
David Boder: So?

00:23:48.107 --> 00:23:49.406
Alexander Gertner: I was...

00:23:49.406 --> 00:23:49.829
David Boder: Eighteen...

00:23:49.829 --> 00:23:51.491
Alexander Gertner: Eighteen. Seventeen and a half years approximately.

00:23:51.491 --> 00:23:53.718
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:23:53.718 --> 00:24:28.275
Alexander Gertner: And so on the road, when I...when all the things were taken away, I took with me...there was a bread lying on the ground, so I picked up a bread. I saw that it is necessary to have a bread with oneself. Whatever is taken away that...and the Phylacteries I took along with me. And on the way...there were very many camps. There were women’s lagers. There were on the road leading to the bathhouse...I see women there standing there and begging. Other people are throwing them something to eat. They fall one on top of the other and fight over the food. So I took the bread and threw it in [to them]. So I saw they threw themselves, maybe five, ten, or fifteen women, maybe more, on that bread.

00:24:28.275 --> 00:24:30.834
David Boder: Were these the women who had been in the lager, or women...

00:24:30.834 --> 00:24:47.623
Alexander Gertner: In the lager, the lager. They were already behind fences. And from afar I saw an SS woman who was managing them. [She] saw that...that they are grabbing bread, so she chased them away. She beat them. So I said [understood] then, I already knew, I already saw that there is a hunger, because they were grabbing....We didn’t know where we were...

00:24:47.623 --> 00:24:48.188
David Boder: Hm.

00:24:48.188 --> 00:25:02.016
Alexander Gertner: We were bewildered. We were led to the baths. And so we were all thirsty. We waited till we came to water so that we could fill up with water. And in the meantime we could not go out [satisfy our needs]. Already for a few days we had not gone out, you know what I mean, in the toilet.

00:25:02.016 --> 00:25:02.288
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:02.288 --> 00:25:03.375
Alexander Gertner: And we...we...

00:25:03.375 --> 00:25:04.695
David Boder: You mean you have kept back?

00:25:04.695 --> 00:25:15.502
Alexander Gertner: We kept back with all our strength. We didn’t eat in the RR-cars, so that we shouldn’t have to go, because it was embarrassing. And...and one couldn’t stand it, a crowd [?] of eighty people, when every person should go out.

00:25:15.502 --> 00:25:15.765
David Boder: Yes?

00:25:15.765 --> 00:25:21.194
Alexander Gertner: You understand? And then we were...when we were...

00:25:21.194 --> 00:25:21.557
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:21.557 --> 00:25:53.047
Alexander Gertner: Yes. When we went to the bath, and there first of all there was a ditch, so everybody went and relieved himself. We didn’t know what...we didn’t know if it was permitted or it was not permitted. We were told to undress nude. We waited in the nude. It was already in the evening. It was cold. We shivered. And they closed...we went inside, and we went to bathe. We entered the bath hall. We were all...we were all told to go into such a water, such a gasoline, that disinfects the body.

00:25:53.047 --> 00:25:53.380
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:57.631
Alexander Gertner: And then we were showered. And so we were crowded in with thousands of people...

00:25:57.631 --> 00:26:00.432
David Boder: What does it mean, you had to walk into gasoline? What was it, a tub?

00:26:00.432 --> 00:26:06.012
Alexander Gertner: Yes, in such a bathtub that is...that is...gasoline...there was something. I don’t know if it is gasoline or such. It disinfects.

00:26:06.012 --> 00:26:06.344
David Boder: Yes?

00:26:06.344 --> 00:26:09.749
Alexander Gertner: There shouldn’t be...something, different things...

00:26:09.749 --> 00:26:10.202
David Boder: Diseases.

00:26:10.202 --> 00:26:11.229
Alexander Gertner: Diseases.

00:26:11.229 --> 00:26:11.803
David Boder: Nu?

00:26:11.803 --> 00:26:21.643
Alexander Gertner: We went in, and there we were showered. And when we went under the shower, we drank up more water than...than we used for bathing, because we are very thirsty.

00:26:21.643 --> 00:26:22.389
David Boder: Yes?

00:26:22.389 --> 00:26:29.933
Alexander Gertner: And then, when we came out, everybody was given a [pair of] pants, these prisoner’s pants, striped, and a jacket and a shirt and a cap. This...

00:26:29.933 --> 00:26:30.438
David Boder: And a cap?

00:26:30.438 --> 00:26:30.640
Alexander Gertner: And a cap.

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.537
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:26:31.537 --> 00:26:36.755
Alexander Gertner: And then, when we came out, no one could recognize the other. We absolutely couldn’t recognize...

00:26:36.755 --> 00:26:37.018
David Boder: Why?

00:26:37.018 --> 00:26:43.172
Alexander Gertner: Because we were other, because we were dressed most differently, with a cap, with a...in such...in such a suit.

00:26:43.172 --> 00:26:45.580
David Boder: The hair wasn’t cut?

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:47.988
Alexander Gertner: The hair was completely cut off, from head to feet.

00:26:47.988 --> 00:26:48.613
David Boder: When?

00:26:48.613 --> 00:26:49.873
Alexander Gertner: Before entering the bath.

00:26:49.873 --> 00:26:50.182
David Boder: Oh!

00:26:50.182 --> 00:26:53.466
Alexander Gertner: There stood barbers. They shore us from head to feet, wherever [?]...

00:26:53.466 --> 00:26:55.662
David Boder: What kind of barbers? With what did they cut?

00:26:55.662 --> 00:26:59.439
Alexander Gertner: With scissors, with different...they tore it together with the flesh.

00:26:59.439 --> 00:26:59.944
David Boder: Nu?

00:26:59.944 --> 00:27:10.026
Alexander Gertner: You understand? And then, when we had been...finished, when we were finished up with the machines, we went in small groups, still in a line, into...into the bath hall.

00:27:10.026 --> 00:27:10.418
David Boder: Nu?

00:27:10.418 --> 00:27:26.844
Alexander Gertner: When we came out, we absolutely couldn’t recognize one another. And here we see how...how one comes out. He shows that he has a blue back, that he had been beaten in...still in the Ghetto, because in the Ghetto it was still so, till that, for instance, the rich people, who were known in town to be rich...

00:27:26.844 --> 00:27:27.046
David Boder: Yes?

00:27:27.046 --> 00:27:35.103
Alexander Gertner: ...and were known as rich people, they were beaten [by] the Hungarian soldiers of the Hungarian army, that they should hand over the gold and the money that they had hidden.

00:27:35.103 --> 00:27:35.315
David Boder: Nu?

00:27:35.315 --> 00:27:37.542
Alexander Gertner: They were beaten. There was such a mangler.

00:27:37.542 --> 00:27:37.865
David Boder: A what?

00:27:37.865 --> 00:27:41.471
Alexander Gertner: A mangler. That was a house, such a house that was called a mangler [a barn housing a mangling machine for cold pressing of clothes].

00:27:41.471 --> 00:27:41.690
David Boder: Yes.

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:52.436
Alexander Gertner: They were taken in there, and they were beaten till [near] death [so] they should tell...to tell everything, where one hid the money and the gold. There was still such a Jew who had been there, in that mangler. In the same...

00:27:52.436 --> 00:27:54.058
David Boder: Mangler was called the place?

00:27:54.058 --> 00:27:55.509
Alexander Gertner: That house was called mangler, yes.

00:27:55.509 --> 00:27:56.859
David Boder: Nu?

00:27:56.859 --> 00:28:01.494
Alexander Gertner: And so he showed what a blue back he had from the beating.

00:28:01.494 --> 00:28:01.675
David Boder: Nu?

00:28:01.675 --> 00:28:14.929
Alexander Gertner: An incident [?]. And then, when we had been bathed, we had...it was already late at night. It was already approxiamtely twelve at night. We...we were put in a row, and we were led, and...

00:28:14.929 --> 00:28:15.192
David Boder: Yes.

00:28:15.192 --> 00:28:24.548
Alexander Gertner: Dark—we did not see anything. We were led. What do we see? We saw only the flames...flames, huge flames, maybe up to fifty meters in height. We saw flames and smoke.

00:28:24.548 --> 00:28:26.261
David Boder: From where? From the pits or...

00:28:26.261 --> 00:28:30.421
Alexander Gertner: From...from the pits. From the crematories such flames didn’t come out, because they had a chimney.

00:28:30.421 --> 00:28:30.784
David Boder: Yes...

00:28:30.784 --> 00:28:31.319
Alexander Gertner: And the...

00:28:31.319 --> 00:28:32.005
David Boder: ...a smokestack.

00:28:32.005 --> 00:28:33.778
Alexander Gertner: Yes, a smokestack.

00:28:33.778 --> 00:28:34.503
David Boder: Nu?

00:28:34.503 --> 00:28:40.718
Alexander Gertner: When we came back, we were taken into a block, into a wooden block, there in the Gypsy lager.

00:28:40.718 --> 00:28:44.636
David Boder: All right. Why was it called the Gypsy lager? Yes?

00:28:44.636 --> 00:28:57.869
Alexander Gertner: In the Gypsy lager there were Gypsies. They had been already longer in camp. And they...they supervised us. They beat with...every little Gypsy was beating. He had a big stick. Such a small child, and he beat...

00:28:57.869 --> 00:28:58.534
David Boder: Whom did he beat?

00:28:58.534 --> 00:29:02.090
Alexander Gertner: Everybody, whoever was close he had the right to beat.

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:02.685
David Boder: Nu?

00:29:02.685 --> 00:29:22.857
Alexander Gertner: So we...we came in at twelve o’clock at night into that lager. We didn’t know anything. So there came in one Gypsy, a tall one, with a club. He says, ‘Whoever has money hidden on him, or gold, should immediately hand it over!’ If it should be found on someone he will shoot him immediately. And we...we said...

00:29:22.857 --> 00:29:24.549
David Boder: What language did he speak?

00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:25.174
Alexander Gertner: German.

00:29:25.174 --> 00:29:26.192
David Boder: German. A Gypsy.

00:29:26.192 --> 00:29:26.947
Alexander Gertner: Yes.

00:29:26.947 --> 00:29:27.150
David Boder: Nu?

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:27.775
Alexander Gertner: And he went...

00:29:27.775 --> 00:29:30.304
David Boder: Why was it called the Gypsy lager?

00:29:30.304 --> 00:29:37.485
Alexander Gertner: Because...because...because there lived Gypsies. There were like this: Lager ‘A’, Lager ‘B’, Lager ‘C’. There were numbers, and this was a Gypsy lager.

00:29:37.485 --> 00:29:39.047
David Boder: And the little ones lived there...

00:29:39.047 --> 00:29:39.461
Alexander Gertner: Yes.

00:29:39.461 --> 00:29:39.966
David Boder: ...with them?

00:29:39.966 --> 00:29:40.984
Alexander Gertner: Yes, as prisoners, too.

00:29:40.984 --> 00:29:41.347
David Boder: They were...

00:29:41.347 --> 00:29:46.172
Alexander Gertner: They were there together with the women and children. They could live together with the women and children.

00:29:46.172 --> 00:29:48.287
David Boder: Nu?

00:29:48.287 --> 00:29:49.305
Alexander Gertner: And so at night...

00:29:49.305 --> 00:29:52.226
David Boder: And they...they were assigned over you?

00:29:52.226 --> 00:29:56.758
Alexander Gertner: Yes. They were assigned over us. They were the block elders and room elders, and so forth.

00:29:56.758 --> 00:29:57.837
David Boder: Hm.

00:29:57.837 --> 00:30:20.064
Alexander Gertner: At night...it was already around three, four. And so we were harangued that we should hand over quickly, and before going to sleep, everybody should hand over everything. There were a few people who had something with them. They surrendered it. And we lay down on the brick [floor]. We were there approximately a thousand people in the barrack. We simply lay one on top of the other. And at four in the morning we were...

00:30:20.064 --> 00:30:21.837
David Boder: Where did you...on what did you lie down?

00:30:21.837 --> 00:30:23.550
Alexander Gertner: On the brick. On the brick [a colloqualism].

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:24.568
David Boder: What does it mean, on the brick?

00:30:24.568 --> 00:30:26.079
Alexander Gertner: On the earth. On the floor.

00:30:26.079 --> 00:30:28.457
David Boder: Aha. Nu?

00:30:28.457 --> 00:30:30.321
Alexander Gertner: Then in the morning at four o’clock...

00:30:30.321 --> 00:30:34.128
David Boder: Wait a moment. Tell me one thing. What was dome afterwards with the Gypsies?

00:30:34.128 --> 00:30:38.077
Alexander Gertner: With the Gypsies? That was later. They were all gassed too. They were all...

00:30:38.077 --> 00:30:38.340
David Boder: Hm.

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:41.141
Alexander Gertner: That was already later. We will come to that later.

00:30:41.141 --> 00:30:42.280
David Boder: Good. And so?

00:30:42.280 --> 00:31:13.393
Alexander Gertner: And when we were...in the morning at four we were already awakened. Here we see smoke. Outside we see fog. It is still dark. It is only four in the morning. We had no sleep whatsoever. We only had gone to sleep an hour ago. And so we are being awakened. We are already beaten. ‘Get up!’ And so we got up. And approximately in...in two, three hours was brought a barrel with black coffee. It was dragged in. We fought one with another. We got...we got...whoever could fight was able to get a little coffee. Black it was. Whoever couldn’t, didn’t get...

00:31:13.393 --> 00:31:15.046
David Boder: In what was it taken?

00:31:15.046 --> 00:31:25.097
Alexander Gertner: In...in different bowls, dirty bowls. There were no bowls altogether. There were two, three bowls. So one grabbed it. Five to ten people had one bowl, and so...

00:31:25.097 --> 00:31:25.762
David Boder: A container?

00:31:25.762 --> 00:31:26.508
Alexander Gertner: A container.

00:31:26.508 --> 00:31:27.838
David Boder: Yes?

00:31:27.838 --> 00:31:36.772
Alexander Gertner: And later...and so this...this was over with the coffee. We again had finished. We were not permitted to leave the block.

00:31:36.772 --> 00:31:36.983
David Boder: Nu.

00:31:36.983 --> 00:32:10.392
Alexander Gertner: We had to stay inside the block. At noon we did not get anything. In the evening one came first to call the row, how many we are. In the evening there came a block elder, listed everyone carefully. Listed. And so the first day we did not get any food. That was on a Monday. And only Tuesday night we first got a piece of bread, on Monday they had to register everybody and report the number so they could get the bread for us. So we got for five people one little piece of bread—five people a bread. That is, a lager bread weighed a kilo twenty [1200 grams]. Heavy bread, it was made with...with wood...

00:32:10.392 --> 00:32:10.957
David Boder: What does that mean, with wood?

00:32:10.957 --> 00:32:14.090
Alexander Gertner: With...with saw...with sawdust it was made.

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:15.017
David Boder: Do you know that for sure?

00:32:15.017 --> 00:32:16.609
Alexander Gertner: Yes. That is a hundred per cent [sure].

00:32:16.609 --> 00:32:16.941
David Boder: Yes.

00:32:16.941 --> 00:32:20.316
Alexander Gertner: And it was given to everybody, five people to a bread, and...

00:32:20.316 --> 00:32:22.422
David Boder: Wait a minute [adjusting the recorder]. Nu?

00:32:22.422 --> 00:32:23.138
Alexander Gertner: Is it set?

00:32:23.138 --> 00:32:26.331
David Boder: Yes. And so?

00:32:26.331 --> 00:33:03.296
Alexander Gertner: And so in the morning [possibly a slip for the evening] we were given the bread After this we had to go to sleep. We didn’t have any...any more to eat. It was Tuesday already, the third day. On Tuesday at noon we were given a little soup. They brought...there were such...such square boxes [containers]. It was brought...in that the food was brought, in such as is brought, carried, here the dirt. There were such square...made out of boards. In this the midday meal was brought. At the midday meal was brought...there was also given to five, to six people a pl-...a bowl. We have...everybody gave a sip. One took a sip, the second took a sip, and the third...

00:33:03.296 --> 00:33:04.616
David Boder: You did not have spoons?

00:33:04.616 --> 00:33:35.850
Alexander Gertner: Spoons, positively not. To have knives and spoons was positively not permitted. Everyone took a sip. So in a turn we did...if one took two sips, the other already cried, ‘What, nothing will be left for me.’ And then when we...that is how much we got. It came out to two, three sips for each, and it was over. And with this...so we were in that Gypsy lager five days. Then we were dragged around all day on the appell. That’s what was going on all day. All...three times a day it was. All day sitting outside. There was a frightful mud [in Polish]. Frightful mud, what is it called in German?

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:37.472
David Boder: Yes. That is all right. Mire. Dirt.

00:33:37.472 --> 00:33:54.412
Alexander Gertner: Yes, dirt. We stood all day in the mud at appell. It was...once or twice the SS came to count us, but the rest of the time the Gypsies made with us ‘caps off’ and ‘caps on’. That we learned. If one didn’t do it right he got a beating. From everyone, from the smallest Gypsy, one could get a beating.

00:33:54.412 --> 00:33:56.336
David Boder: What did the small Gypsies do?

00:33:56.336 --> 00:34:02.973
Alexander Gertner: They have...they were children. They were the children of the older ones. They were there. They also ordered us around. They saw that the older ones were beating so they also beat.

00:34:02.973 --> 00:34:03.819
David Boder: So...and?

00:34:03.819 --> 00:34:05.239
Alexander Gertner: [With sarcasm:] It was a good deed to beat [us].

00:34:05.239 --> 00:34:06.197
David Boder: Nu?

00:34:06.197 --> 00:34:42.522
Alexander Gertner: And the...and so the whole day we sat [spent] at appell, in the morasses. And so we...we prayed to God to get away already from this lager. We saw that we could not stand this. It was frightful, this lager. Everybody was...there was not one who didn’t get a beating. And five days we were in this lager. We were moved from one block to another. Every day we were moved to another block, because there were constant changes. Here had arrived new people. Here were too many. Here were too few. And so then we were taken to another lager. They selected...people with skills were ordered to report. Those who had learned a trade should report. I too, reported as a carpenter.

00:34:42.522 --> 00:34:43.338
David Boder: Yes?

00:34:43.338 --> 00:35:01.123
Alexander Gertner: And I was selected. Also later I was put among the carpenters. I was taken away to another lager. Together with me were taken approximately two thousand people. We were in the middle of the distribution of supper. It hadn’t reached me yet, and I was ordered already to drag myself on to...to Lager ‘A’. So we came...

00:35:01.123 --> 00:35:03.652
David Boder: Oh. This was right Birkenau...

00:35:03.652 --> 00:35:05.576
Alexander Gertner: Right in Birkenau, but there were many lagers [sectors].

00:35:05.576 --> 00:35:06.120
David Boder: ...but in a different section?

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:08.860
Alexander Gertner: In another section, to another lager. There were various lagers.

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:09.576
David Boder: Yes?

00:35:09.576 --> 00:35:18.177
Alexander Gertner: We arrived in Lager ‘A’. It rained frightfully heavily. We...we couldn’t get through. There were...there were so many morasses...

00:35:18.177 --> 00:35:19.104
David Boder: It rained?

00:35:19.104 --> 00:35:21.391
Alexander Gertner: It rained. There were morasses, with stones, so slippery...

00:35:21.391 --> 00:35:22.167
David Boder: Yes, sodden.

00:35:22.167 --> 00:35:30.859
Alexander Gertner: Sodden. We arrived there in the camp. We were put in. There were such three storied beds—not beds, wide plank-beds.

00:35:30.859 --> 00:35:31.182
David Boder: Yes.

00:35:31.182 --> 00:35:59.107
Alexander Gertner: We were put in there. It was wet from the rain, because there was no good roof. It rained in. When we came in one threw himself on another so that we just could remain lying down. On the next day we were lined up. Everybody’s data were taken down, how old he is, where he was born, and all that. I reported myself at that time as being older, because it was said that the lager accepts only those over eighteen years of age. I was then under eighteen. So I reported myself as born in ’24.

00:35:59.107 --> 00:36:00.497
David Boder: Did they believe you?

00:36:00.497 --> 00:36:03.056
Alexander Gertner: They believed me, because I looked older, because I looked bad.

00:36:03.056 --> 00:36:05.162
David Boder: Born in ’24. That means that you were...

00:36:05.162 --> 00:36:06.694
Alexander Gertner: That I was twenty years old.

00:36:06.694 --> 00:36:06.927
David Boder: Nu?

00:36:06.927 --> 00:36:09.425
Alexander Gertner: That I should be taken for work.

00:36:09.425 --> 00:36:10.422
David Boder: Yes?

00:36:10.422 --> 00:36:17.694
Alexander Gertner: And then...the next day we were called up, and then they began to tattoo. Everybody was tattooed. Everybody was...

00:36:17.694 --> 00:36:19.407
David Boder: Who did the tattooing?

00:36:19.407 --> 00:36:22.409
Alexander Gertner: There were such people. They stood there lined up.

00:36:22.409 --> 00:36:22.902
David Boder: Also prisoners?

00:36:22.902 --> 00:36:25.175
Alexander Gertner: Also prisoners. Everything was done by prisoners.

00:36:25.175 --> 00:36:26.662
David Boder: Yes. Jewish?

00:36:26.662 --> 00:36:30.218
Alexander Gertner: That I don’t know, whether Jewish, Polish, different nationalities.

00:36:30.218 --> 00:36:33.049
David Boder: Nu? Did the tattooing hurt?

00:36:33.049 --> 00:36:47.270
Alexander Gertner: It hurt, but...it swelled up a little at first. He stood there with such a piece of wood, a pointed one dipped in ink, and he struck. He did not care whether one was silent or one spoke. He [each one] was given a number, this number beaten in...this number. So in a line [one after another] it went very fast.

00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:48.651
David Boder: With what? With a needle or with...

00:36:48.651 --> 00:36:51.361
Alexander Gertner: With such a wooden...such a piece of wood, a pointed piece of wood.

00:36:51.361 --> 00:36:53.225
David Boder: This was used for tattooing?

00:36:53.225 --> 00:36:53.730
Alexander Gertner: Yes.

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:54.295
David Boder: Nu?

00:36:54.295 --> 00:37:32.447
Alexander Gertner: And then when they had finished with all the tattooing...we were two thousand people...and we were lined up. We were led to Auschwitz. Well, we didn’t know at first where we were being led to. We came...when we marched in the direction of the railroad station, we believed that we are already going to another lager, to another place. We thanked God that we were already going away from this...from this place. Coming to the railroad station, crossing the railroad station, we said, ‘Oh, again we are not going away from here.’ We come to the other side of the railroad station. We come in there. We already see prisoners working not far from the lager, also in the same kind of clothes, in these white and blue...in blue-white [striped] clothes.

00:37:32.447 --> 00:37:33.616
David Boder: Hm.

00:37:33.616 --> 00:37:39.921
Alexander Gertner: So we ask, ‘What’s here?’ They are not permitted to answer, because they have over them the over...the capos. They were not permitted to answer.

00:37:39.921 --> 00:37:42.389
David Boder: And what were the rules? One was not permitted to talk?

00:37:42.389 --> 00:37:44.434
Alexander Gertner: One wasn’t permitted to talk with...with a strange person.

00:37:44.434 --> 00:37:48.232
David Boder: And who explained to you what was permitted and what was not permitted?

00:37:48.232 --> 00:37:59.945
Alexander Gertner: It was not explained. We saw that for this one gets beaten, so we knew that this was not permitted. They...they did not explain, ‘this you can’t do.’ If one did something, even [if] it was right, one [the capo] also gave a blow with a club.

00:37:59.945 --> 00:38:00.993
David Boder: Hm.

00:38:00.993 --> 00:38:08.718
Alexander Gertner: And then when we came [words not clear].

00:38:08.718 --> 00:38:13.401
David Boder: [Words not clear.] Nu?

00:38:13.401 --> 00:38:41.632
Alexander Gertner: So nobody was taught what he had to do, what one had to do. They only beat. This was first of all. One was struck. One was beaten. And so we had arrived...continued marching, these two thousand people. We are tired. We come...we arrive in front...there stands...we see a gate. We already see wires. We see here the wires of a lager. On the gate is written...before the gate everybody stopped. We were counted. We see it is written on the gate: ‘Work makes free.’

00:38:41.632 --> 00:38:43.859
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:38:43.859 --> 00:38:56.146
Alexander Gertner: We went through the gate. Everybody was counted fifteen times, from the front and from the back. We entered. We were made to stand there on the street. We were standing in the lager, in Auschwitz. We stood in the street maybe two, three hours till evening.

00:38:56.146 --> 00:38:57.354
David Boder: Yes.

00:38:57.354 --> 00:39:04.294
Alexander Gertner: And we stood there. Later we were taken in groups and taken to the bath hall. There, too, we were bathed.

00:39:04.294 --> 00:39:06.098
David Boder: [Words not clear.]

00:39:06.098 --> 00:39:15.847
Alexander Gertner: We entered. We were bathed there. The clothes were taken away. The clothes were taken to be disinfected. And we were left naked. And we had to run to Block 6. There was a block where also...

00:39:15.847 --> 00:39:16.774
David Boder: What does it mean, naked?

00:39:16.774 --> 00:39:18.185
Alexander Gertner: Completely naked, [words not clear].

00:39:18.185 --> 00:39:19.445
David Boder: And the shoes?

00:39:19.445 --> 00:39:23.031
Alexander Gertner: Nothing, nothing. Only the shoes were...the shoes were held in the hands.

00:39:23.031 --> 00:39:23.212
David Boder: Nu?

00:39:23.212 --> 00:39:26.608
Alexander Gertner: The shoes we...the shoes we could hold in the hands [could take with us], because the shoes were not disinfected.

00:39:26.608 --> 00:39:27.010
David Boder: Yes.

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:30.898
Alexander Gertner: We had to run with the shoes in the hand, and...till Block 6.

00:39:30.898 --> 00:39:31.412
David Boder: Nu?

00:39:31.412 --> 00:39:39.620
Alexander Gertner: There in Block 6...we entered. We were put in there. There were three-tiered beds. Two people to a bed, we were put in there.

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:54.294
David Boder: [In English:] This concludes Spool 77. We continue with Mr. Alexander Gertner on Spool number 78.

00:39:54.294 --> 00:40:13.631
David Boder: Spool number 78, continuation of Spool number 77. Geneva [Switzerland], August 26, 1946, at the home for displaced Jews. Mr. Alexander Gertner continuing.

00:40:13.631 --> 00:40:19.073
David Boder: [In Yiddish:] And so you entered there, and you were running naked...

00:40:19.073 --> 00:40:19.849
Alexander Gertner: Naked, and we ran...

00:40:19.849 --> 00:40:21.088
David Boder: ...with the shoes in one’s hand.

00:40:21.088 --> 00:40:28.964
Alexander Gertner: With the shoes in the hand we ran into Block 6, and there we were thrown into the beds that...two men to a bed, and there in this block...

00:40:28.964 --> 00:40:29.780
David Boder: Two to a bed?

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:45.118
Alexander Gertner: Two to a bed. A three-tiered bed, such a narrow one, from eighty [centimeters] to a meter in width. It wasn’t a meter. It was eighty or seventy centimeters wide. And there were...in this block were Poles. Polish gentiles were barrack chiefs and room chiefs. They were frightfully bad...

00:40:45.118 --> 00:40:46.750
David Boder: A little slower.

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:57.788
Alexander Gertner: And they waited there with brooms. They were screaming in Polish. We didn’t understand them. They were screaming. We didn’t know what they wanted. All they did was slap. So in this block we were...

00:40:57.788 --> 00:40:59.410
David Boder: And they were prisoners?

00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:31.264
Alexander Gertner: Also prisoners, yes. And so there we...we lay in bed naked. We didn’t have the clothes. The clothes were given to disin-...it was taken away from us. And so this night we passed the night naked. In the morning we were given only the shirt. They were shirts already...everybody was lined up. We were given the shirts, and since we already stood in line, also a little black coffee simultaneously. And then later, at dinnertime [noon/, it was ordered that dinner should be brought. So people immediately were running for dinner.

00:41:31.264 --> 00:41:34.844
David Boder: Yes?

00:41:34.844 --> 00:41:58.394
Alexander Gertner: And so when it was dinner [time], we dragged [ourselves] to dinner. It was brought. We were hungry, because already for two days we had not eaten. That means the day when we were led away from Ausch-...from Birkenau we did not eat, because there already we could not get any food. Only on the third day, when we were accepted [registered], were we given to eat. It was already the third day...

00:41:58.394 --> 00:42:00.026
David Boder: And so tell me one thing.

00:42:00.026 --> 00:42:00.470
Alexander Gertner: Yes?

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:05.174
David Boder: How does one feel when one does not get any food for three days?

00:42:05.174 --> 00:42:20.180
Alexander Gertner: Well, one feels how it gnaws at the heart. One feels like one is falling down. The blood, it becomes from day to day weaker. One feels that one is falling down, and one feels one can’t get up. When one sits down, one can’t rise again. One feels terrible...

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:23.606
David Boder: Well, you had fasted on Yom Kippur [Day of Atonement]. That is one day...

00:42:23.606 --> 00:42:24.050
Alexander Gertner: Yes.

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:24.654
David Boder: ...and a night.

00:42:24.654 --> 00:42:25.823
Alexander Gertner: Yes.

00:42:25.823 --> 00:42:31.352
David Boder: Nu, but how did it feel when one does not get any food?

00:42:31.352 --> 00:42:32.340
Alexander Gertner: On Yom Kippur we...

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:35.201
David Boder: Did you try to eat any other things, to bite [chew] at something?

00:42:35.201 --> 00:42:43.017
Alexander Gertner: What could one bite? There was nothing there but the stones to bite. There was nothing that one could bite. One couldn’t bite anything.

00:42:43.017 --> 00:42:46.694
David Boder: And the people who smoked, did they have anything to smoke?

00:42:46.694 --> 00:42:54.963
Alexander Gertner: They didn’t have. They fought [?] for it. One gave a puff, the other got a puff, the third a puff...

00:42:54.963 --> 00:42:55.937
David Boder: From the same [each other’s] mouth.

00:42:55.937 --> 00:43:05.656
Alexander Gertner: From the same mouth, yes. When one had something, it was sold. One gave away the piece of bread if he was a heavy smoker for...for...for a cigarette. I fortunately [?] am not a smoker.

00:43:05.656 --> 00:43:06.411
David Boder: Who is not a smoker?

00:43:06.411 --> 00:43:07.459
Alexander Gertner: I don’t smoke.

00:43:07.459 --> 00:43:10.229
David Boder: Oh. [Words not clear.] Nu? And so?

00:43:10.229 --> 00:43:24.882
Alexander Gertner: And then...and so I was in Block 6 [words not clear]. For us came little food. We were not yet counted as workers. The other people in Auschwitz were already working. We were not workers. We were in Block 6. And so we spent there eight days...

00:43:24.882 --> 00:43:25.145
David Boder: Nu?

00:43:25.145 --> 00:43:40.816
Alexander Gertner: ...eight days. It was frightful. In the daytime...in the daytime we were made to stand all day on appell. They counted. Again they counted. Again registered. Again counted. And at night, at ten o’clock, we had to go to sleep, and at half past two one was awakened. In Auschwitz one was awakened at half past two...

00:43:40.816 --> 00:43:43.163
David Boder: Hm.

00:43:43.163 --> 00:43:44.906
Alexander Gertner: ...German...German [Berlin] time.

00:43:44.906 --> 00:43:45.178
David Boder: Yes?

00:43:45.178 --> 00:44:06.317
Alexander Gertner: German [word not clear]. And then, when we were already regist-...there arrived an SS superior officer, asked everybody what his trade was. And everybody was told to step forward separately [by trades], and I was then...I was then picked also as a carpenter. I was picked as a carpenter. I was taken there together with eight other people into the DAW, German Assembly [Equipment] Works.

00:44:06.317 --> 00:44:07.275
David Boder: Nu?

00:44:07.275 --> 00:44:17.598
Alexander Gertner: I was taken there. I was led into the Machine Room....There was a machine room where there were only machines. And the DAW...it was...twelve hundred people worked there, prisoners.

00:44:17.598 --> 00:44:18.505
David Boder: Hm.

00:44:18.505 --> 00:44:40.248
Alexander Gertner: There were various halls. And so I was taken into the machine room. There was a foreman, a civilian, a German. Not a prisoner, a gentile [?]. So he calls me over, [and] says, ‘What can you do?’ I told him that I can work on machines. I told him that I can do everything. I should be taken on quickly and taught [instructed]. So he put me at a band saw, a band [?] saw, a machine, a certain job, a job [?].

00:44:40.248 --> 00:44:42.031
David Boder: Nu?

00:44:42.031 --> 00:44:52.264
Alexander Gertner: And so he saw [that I worked] with another one. I helped the other. and so he didn’t like it. He put me together with a Pole at such a saw, also such a saw [words not clear].

00:44:52.264 --> 00:44:53.161
David Boder: Yes.

00:44:53.161 --> 00:45:26.630
Alexander Gertner: He put me there. He wanted the new people to...he enjoyed it if somebody cut off his finger. Everyday we saw fingers on the ground. Such people were put on [the machines] who never had any idea about machines. So immediately he would cut off his finger. The first day he already told me to work the machine by myself. I should cut by myself. When he saw that I watched, I didn’t cut off my finger so quick, he said that I am not to his liking. I was put out. I worked there for two days, and it wasn’t to his liking. I was put out. The capo took me and led me into Hall ‘C’, already a different hall, not [entirely] a machine room. There were a lot of machines, too, but bench work was also done there.

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:27.467
David Boder: Nu?

00:45:27.467 --> 00:45:43.833
Alexander Gertner: Carpentry...carpenter benches, hand...hand...yes, hand work. And so I was asked there, ‘What can you do?’ ‘I know...I know hand work. I can work by machines.’ Good. I am put at a machine together with a Jew, a Jew from Lithuania. I was put also...also a supervisor [?].

00:45:43.833 --> 00:45:45.093
David Boder: A Christian?

00:45:45.093 --> 00:45:46.111
Alexander Gertner: No, a Jewish one.

00:45:46.111 --> 00:45:47.038
David Boder: So?

00:45:47.038 --> 00:45:52.869
Alexander Gertner: I am put there. I worked there with him. And so with this man...I worked with him for a few weeks.

00:45:52.869 --> 00:45:54.833
David Boder: What was manufactured in this place?

00:45:54.833 --> 00:45:58.661
Alexander Gertner: We did...we did...In this DAW we worked at various things. It was...

00:45:58.661 --> 00:46:00.797
David Boder: In what [where]? What was it called?

00:46:00.797 --> 00:46:03.054
Alexander Gertner: In DAW. D-A-W.

00:46:03.054 --> 00:46:03.800
David Boder: D-A-W.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:07.567
Alexander Gertner: That was the name. German Assembly [Equipment] Works, [words not clear; sounds like: in a church].

00:46:07.567 --> 00:46:09.138
David Boder: Yes.

00:46:09.138 --> 00:46:15.473
Alexander Gertner: And...and so there, in that factory, were made various beds for lagers, all the things mostly for the lagers.

00:46:15.473 --> 00:46:15.715
David Boder: Yes.

00:46:15.715 --> 00:46:25.464
Alexander Gertner: Beds and varous things of wood [?]. Various things for constructions. We...we manufactured there a lot of things. There I worked with the Jew...

00:46:25.464 --> 00:46:27.358
David Boder: Where did they get the boards [lumber] from?

00:46:27.358 --> 00:46:31.156
Alexander Gertner: They brought in. Rr-cars [loaded] with boards were brought. There was a siding laid right into the factory.

00:46:31.156 --> 00:46:31.328
David Boder: Hm.

00:46:31.328 --> 00:46:36.455
Alexander Gertner: And the machine...by train the materials were brought in.

00:46:36.455 --> 00:46:36.929
David Boder: Hm. Yes.

00:46:36.929 --> 00:46:45.677
Alexander Gertner: Boards. Ready products were shipped out. And so we worked there...we worked eleven hours a day, from six to six, one hour for dinner.

00:46:45.677 --> 00:46:48.008
David Boder: Hm. What did one do during this hour [?]?

00:46:48.008 --> 00:46:52.839
Alexander Gertner: We got up. We got up, that is, at three thirty in this section [?].

00:46:52.839 --> 00:46:53.231
David Boder: Hm.

00:46:53.231 --> 00:47:09.809
Alexander Gertner: Up at three thirty, and one had...one had to wash quickly, and...one had to wash quickly. And after washing we got a little piece of bread. Sometimes we got the bread in the evening. Sometimes we got it in the morning. It depended on when the bread arrived, and one...

00:47:09.809 --> 00:47:11.929
David Boder: If one got it in the evening was it...

00:47:11.929 --> 00:47:19.290
Alexander Gertner: It was eaten up in the evening. And he didn’t have...nothing was given in the morning.

00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:20.104
David Boder: Hm.

00:47:20.104 --> 00:47:22.947
Alexander Gertner: Some saved a piece for the morning. A little piece of bread one could save. In the morning one got up quickly. After washing up we had to make the bed.

00:47:22.947 --> 00:47:24.766
David Boder: Where did one hide it [the saved bread]?

00:47:24.766 --> 00:47:26.917
Alexander Gertner: Where did one hide it? Under the head.

00:47:26.917 --> 00:47:27.381
David Boder: Under the head?

00:47:27.381 --> 00:47:27.754
Alexander Gertner: Under the head [pillow?].

00:47:27.754 --> 00:47:28.368
David Boder: Hm.

00:47:28.368 --> 00:47:32.567
Alexander Gertner: Many people [?] had it stolen.

00:47:32.567 --> 00:47:32.910
David Boder: Nu?

00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:42.771
Alexander Gertner: And...and after washing up, we had to make the bed the right was. If one didn’t make the bed exactly the right way, if it wasn’t aligned exactly...he had to measure exactly so that it would be right [?].

00:47:42.771 --> 00:47:44.169
David Boder: What does it mean, making the bed?

00:47:44.169 --> 00:47:45.820
Alexander Gertner: Making the bed...and so...

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:47.338
David Boder: Were there blankets?

00:47:47.338 --> 00:47:50.603
Alexander Gertner: Straighten out blankets. There such straw sacks with...with...

00:47:50.603 --> 00:47:52.874
David Boder: How many people slept in one bed?

00:47:52.874 --> 00:47:53.717
Alexander Gertner: Two.

00:47:53.717 --> 00:47:54.079
David Boder: Two.

00:47:54.079 --> 00:48:00.868
Alexander Gertner: At the beginning. Then when the population thinned out we slept only one in a bed. There were such three-tiered beds. One climbed on top of another one. Narrow beds, very narrow.

00:48:00.868 --> 00:48:02.958
David Boder: And with whom did one sleep?

00:48:02.958 --> 00:48:50.800
Alexander Gertner: With whom? With whomever one was assigned. With whom one was told we had to sleep. There was no debate [?] [an unfinished word] ....We had to make the bed perfectly. And later we were chased out into the street [outdoors]. It was still dark. After we were chased out on the street, there one had to stand. In the summer it wasn’t so terrible yet. But in the winter there were frightful snows. We had to stand until three...[correction] until five thirty. At five thirty we fell in and...fell in, and immediately marched. And at six o’clock we passed already through the gate. There we were counted. Everyone was given...was assigned to a labor detail. Every labor detail went to its work. We were taken over. The SS took us over. There were those who worked outside in town...in town, but far, maybe a kilometer, away from the lager. The SS accompanied, and those who worked in the lager proper had capos, i.e., overseers from among the prisoners themselves [?].

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:52.167
David Boder: Yes.

00:48:52.167 --> 00:48:58.986
Alexander Gertner: And I worked in the DAW. It happened that it was a little far, so sentries came there with us.

00:48:58.986 --> 00:48:59.739
David Boder: Who came there?

00:48:59.739 --> 00:49:19.209
Alexander Gertner: Sentries led us, German, well, SS who watched...who watched that we shouldn’t run away. With arms in the hands. We shouldn’t run away. And so there I worked in the munitions factory with that Jew [?] by the machine. I helped out. And then the capo came over. He didn’t like [it] that I worked there. It isn’t good, he says. I don’t help much, and he doesn’t like it.

00:49:19.209 --> 00:49:20.305
David Boder: What was not good?

00:49:20.305 --> 00:49:48.603
Alexander Gertner: That I don’t help good. He doesn’t...he doesn’t like it that I work there. So he sent me over to another machine. He beat me and such. I knew that I will be thrown out of here. I was put at another—also with another Jew there—at another machine. I had to help there. So I was sent around from one machine to another. They themselves didn’t know [what it was about]. Not only me, everybody was changed around. [Pause.]

00:49:48.603 --> 00:49:51.868
David Boder: So you were going from one machine to another. Nu?

00:49:51.868 --> 00:50:25.300
Alexander Gertner: Yes. We were [unfinished word]...but I worked. From one machine to another. I was sent from one place to another. It lasted three months. Three months I worked in the...the DAW. And there were already too many people. Sometimes this happened, that they sent [too many], because they didn’t know what to do with the people. There were so many people they didn’t have some kind of work to give them. The work was tossed around. It was like this there. We worked there on Sunday. Well, six days a week we worked for eleven hours, and on Sunday we worked...every second Sunday and sometimes every Sunday. We had to...the Sunday work was even more terrible for us that the whole week.

00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:27.993
David Boder: But did the Germans, the SS, work too [?]?

00:50:27.993 --> 00:50:37.854
Alexander Gertner: Yes. There were, of course, SS, and there were also prisoners, gentiles, Jews. Well, gentiles. At first there were no Jewish [supervisers], at the beginning. And so they beat and struck.

00:50:37.854 --> 00:50:38.547
David Boder: Hm.

00:50:38.547 --> 00:51:00.607
Alexander Gertner: And so Sunday it was thus. We had to load all the things that we made during the week. We had to load them on wagons. And the dirt, the sawdust...the loading was terrible. Quick, with a haste [a tempo] we had to run up with...with the...with the wheelbarrows, as they were called, onto the...the wagons. On Sunday we had to load all the things that we had made there during the past week. You understand?

00:51:00.607 --> 00:51:01.541
David Boder: Yes.

00:51:01.541 --> 00:51:08.722
Alexander Gertner: And like this I worked in the factory. It was only half the grief, because at least we worked there under a roof.

00:51:08.722 --> 00:51:08.915
David Boder: Yes?

00:51:08.915 --> 00:51:13.686
Alexander Gertner: The others...there were others who worked in the snow and rain. This they couldn’t survive.

00:51:13.686 --> 00:51:15.313
David Boder: [Whispers:] Don’t talk away [from the microphone].

00:51:15.313 --> 00:51:15.734
Alexander Gertner: Yes.

00:51:15.734 --> 00:51:16.740
David Boder: Nu, and?

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:35.848
Alexander Gertner: So there we worked. We worked under a roof. And so, near us there worked in the DAW...they had the ‘Union Factory.’ There worked—that was a munitions factory—there worked approximately seven hundred men and seven hundred women, day shift and night shift.

00:51:35.848 --> 00:51:36.541
David Boder: Nu?

00:51:36.541 --> 00:51:43.812
Alexander Gertner: By day, at noon we had an hour for dinner [recess]. At noon, one hour. But the girls had only half an hour.

00:51:43.812 --> 00:51:44.565
David Boder: Why?

00:51:44.565 --> 00:52:05.511
Alexander Gertner: Because they had less [produced less?]. They had to work longer. And we ran...we finished the food quickly and ran fast to see whether there were not any relatives or acquaintances among them [?]. But we could not talk to them, because there was such a street that separated us, and the wires, high wires. But we watched. If no SS were passing by, or a capo, we could say a word...

00:52:05.511 --> 00:52:05.824
David Boder: Hm.

00:52:05.824 --> 00:52:06.408
Alexander Gertner: ...on the sly.

00:52:06.408 --> 00:52:07.402
David Boder: Nu?

00:52:07.402 --> 00:52:42.531
Alexander Gertner: To find out some news. So sometimes transports from Birkenau to Auschwitz passed by. They came to bathe, to be disinfected. Girls passed by, looking frightful. One couldn’t recognize [them]. They were walking in rags, almost naked. They were shorn, with naked heads. And so one girl called me by name, and I couldn’t recognize her. [She was] from our town. I didn’t recognize her. She looked frightful. She was...we made wooden spoons in the factory, various things, so they should have something to eat with. They begged for spoons, knives, forks, no matter what, so they should have something to eat with. And so we made them wooden spoons in...in the factory.

00:52:42.531 --> 00:52:44.610
David Boder: Nu?

00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:47.996
Alexander Gertner: And so like this I worked in this factory for three months.

00:52:47.996 --> 00:52:49.363
David Boder: Hm.

00:52:49.363 --> 00:53:13.690
Alexander Gertner: Till September, ’44. And there...then I was taken with another hundred people, and I was put out from the factory, because there were too many people. They didn’t have work to do for the people, so they put them out. Then I was taken, and so the next day at appell it was noticed that the people who were put out were assigned to constructions. That was the...the worst kind of work that was...these people...

00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:14.172
David Boder: To what?

00:53:14.172 --> 00:53:16.090
Alexander Gertner: The worst work. Construction it was called.

00:53:16.090 --> 00:53:16.765
David Boder: Construction?

00:53:16.765 --> 00:53:25.934
Alexander Gertner: Yes, that was the name of the labor detail. That consisted of unloading bricks, wagons with bricks, with cement, with stones, with various heavy things, and at a fast pace [a tempo].

00:53:25.934 --> 00:53:26.398
David Boder: Hm.

00:53:26.398 --> 00:53:33.037
Alexander Gertner: We had to unload a whole wagon of bricks in ten minutes. Frightful. A few people, because the wagons quickly...had to be moved quickly...

00:53:33.037 --> 00:53:33.170
David Boder: Yes.

00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:34.332
Alexander Gertner: ...so that new ones could come quickly.

00:53:34.332 --> 00:53:34.603
David Boder: Hm.

00:53:34.603 --> 00:53:39.477
Alexander Gertner: That was the most frightful work. I thought in this...in this factory I won’t last more than a few days.

00:53:39.477 --> 00:53:40.080
David Boder: Nu?

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:58.947
Alexander Gertner: At this construction. And so, God is...thank God, I worked there only one day. It was terrible, and so already the next day there came a labor official, also a pris-...a prisoner, and I and a few other people were chosen for another labor detail. We were brought to the other labor detail. They said, ‘Trage Halle’. That was the name of the detail...

00:53:58.947 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: What name?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:54:01.297
Alexander Gertner: Trage Halle [the word Trage is either not clear, or is a special term meaning a garage or automobile repair shop]. That was a labor detail.

00:54:01.297 --> 00:54:02.062
David Boder: Trage?

00:54:02.062 --> 00:54:03.189
Alexander Gertner: Trage Halle.

00:54:03.189 --> 00:54:03.894
David Boder: Yes. What was it?

00:54:03.894 --> 00:54:05.623
Alexander Gertner: That was a car factory [shop].

00:54:05.623 --> 00:54:05.906
David Boder: Yes.

00:54:05.906 --> 00:54:17.617
Alexander Gertner: That was a...well, we fixed, we repaired there the S...there was there a...there was...an SS [detail] lived there, a barrack, large quarters where the SS lived. In these were all chauffers. All had trucks.

00:54:17.617 --> 00:54:18.117
David Boder: Hm.

00:54:18.117 --> 00:54:32.316
Alexander Gertner: And these...that had to be repaired at...or these...these...something had to be repaired. But mostly there were machines [motors] to be overhauled. Because they had machines [motors] that ran on gasoline. So we converted them for wood, because they did not have gasoline that is used.

00:54:32.316 --> 00:54:32.629
David Boder: Yes.

00:54:32.629 --> 00:54:39.237
Alexander Gertner: We put in such boilers. We made this...this was...this was the labor detail, the Trage Halle, and there [?]...

00:54:39.237 --> 00:54:41.707
David Boder: Do you know why it was called Trage Halle?

00:54:41.707 --> 00:54:43.827
Alexander Gertner: So it was called. I don’t know why.

00:54:43.827 --> 00:54:51.256
David Boder: Nu? Nu?

00:54:51.256 --> 00:55:20.694
Alexander Gertner: And then I was...I was assigned there, assigned to a capo, a State [real] German. He was frightfully mean. The new people who arrived, the arrivals, the new ones, were called the arrivals. He came over...yes! We...we came there, eighteen people. We were called the bunker builders. We were brought over to him, because they wanted to build there air-raid shelters, such pits with cement, fixed [?] to hide things there. For instance, all kinds of ammunitions, various things.

00:55:20.694 --> 00:55:20.857
David Boder: Hm.

00:55:20.857 --> 00:55:24.212
Alexander Gertner: Soon they needed additional people. So we were brought over.

00:55:24.212 --> 00:55:24.453
David Boder: Yes.

00:55:24.453 --> 00:55:49.164
Alexander Gertner: And so we were brought over. We had a separate capo. He also had come together with us. So we were taken out on a field near the factory. And we had...we made bunkers, air-raid shelters. Like this we made the bunkers. It was [word not clear]. We several times measured the corners. took lime, did the masonry, and various [word not clear], and built air-raid shelters. I still want to mention it happened to be exactly Yom Kippur [Day of Atonement, a fast day], so I fasted. And at that time we had to...

00:55:49.164 --> 00:55:50.562
David Boder: Was it bad to fast?

00:55:50.562 --> 00:55:51.116
Alexander Gertner: What?

00:55:51.116 --> 00:55:52.833
David Boder: Was it hard to fast?

00:55:52.833 --> 00:55:59.532
Alexander Gertner: It was hard. We had no strength [?], but we exerted ourselves, because we knew...anyway how long...as long as we live, let us at least fast on Yom Kippur.

00:55:59.532 --> 00:56:00.628
David Boder: Hm.

00:56:00.628 --> 00:56:02.477
Alexander Gertner: I remember we...we pre-fasted [took the last meal before starting the fast].

00:56:02.477 --> 00:56:05.128
David Boder: How did you know the date? How did you know...

00:56:05.128 --> 00:56:09.315
Alexander Gertner: We...we knew. Everything was figured out in the head, in different ways. It was exact, approximately [the word is obviously used out of place, by ‘inertia’].

00:56:09.315 --> 00:56:10.261
David Boder: Nu?

00:56:10.261 --> 00:56:41.039
Alexander Gertner: There were Jews there who had...who knew exactly when they had arrived, what the date was at that time. One knew. I was there with another few Jews, religious men who...We saved the bread from the previous day and a little margarine that we had received there. And we hid it there. And so it was near the evening at...at work when we were already ordered to fall in to return to the lager. So we hid ourselves there between the lumber, and...and we wanted to pre-fast [take the pre-fast meal]. We were missing. We had tarried a little.

00:56:41.039 --> 00:56:41.503
David Boder: Hm.

00:56:41.503 --> 00:56:59.166
Alexander Gertner: A little. We had to do it so quickly. It lasted...it could have lasted five minutes. Suddenly we are being looked for. We didn’t know. We were hiding. Later on one comes yelling [?], ‘Hi, you are being looked for.’ So we already got some beating, a few blows [?]. We returned, and so the next day—I still remember—on Yom Kippur...

00:56:59.166 --> 00:57:01.076
David Boder: What happened? Others received the beating?

00:57:01.076 --> 00:57:02.534
Alexander Gertner: We got the beating.

00:57:02.534 --> 00:57:03.148
David Boder: You got the beating?

00:57:03.148 --> 00:57:16.955
Alexander Gertner: Yes, because we were a few minutes late. The next day, on Yom Kippur, we worked at...there was such a tractor which pulled heavy cement [possibly blocks], heavy concrete. The air-raid shelters were built with concrete so it couldn’t be bombed [through].

00:57:16.955 --> 00:57:17.437
David Boder: Yes.

00:57:17.437 --> 00:57:27.268
Alexander Gertner: So we had to lay it out quick, while the tractor was moving, and lift quickly, and put underneath such round pieces of lumber so that the tractor should roll the concrete [blocks?] that...that...

00:57:27.268 --> 00:57:27.882
David Boder: Yes.

00:57:27.882 --> 00:57:37.593
Alexander Gertner: ...on these poles, and besides this, to lift it up with...with such levers. This was on Yom Kippur. I remember, the most fright-...the hardest work we had done happened on Yom Kippur.

00:57:37.593 --> 00:57:40.918
David Boder: But the capos, the SS didn’t know that it was Yom Kippur.

00:57:40.918 --> 00:57:48.882
Alexander Gertner: What do they know about Yom Kippur! We didn’t...and so...so it was. And so on those air-raid shelters we worked there for four weeks.

00:57:48.882 --> 00:57:49.213
David Boder: Hm.

00:57:49.213 --> 00:58:04.436
Alexander Gertner: The building of the bunkers was finished, so we were taken to chop wood. There was...the autos...they had to run on wood, because they made these cars with such boilers that had to burn not gasoline, but wood. There was a huge hall, and we chopped wood. There was a machine...

00:58:04.436 --> 00:58:07.038
David Boder: Was the sawdust not good for that?

00:58:07.038 --> 00:58:11.056
Alexander Gertner: The sawdust was shipped some place else. That was not used for the cars.

00:58:11.056 --> 00:58:11.568
David Boder: Hm.

00:58:11.568 --> 00:58:56.503
Alexander Gertner: And so there was a hall. There was a machine that sawed. One [person sawed there, and the other two chopped with an ax. Why is it hard to chop the wood? It was like this. I, too, was taken over there to work. The work there was also terrible. We had to work fast, just work. Everyone had to finish four such...such rows of wood. That was such an assignment [?]. If one could not do it quickly, or it was bad wood, he...it was frightful. He caught a beating. And so I worked there also. In that hall I also worked for a few weeks. Thank God later came...came the capo, and he asked if somebody would go to the paint shop. There were, for instance, the cars which had been repaired. They were taken to the paint shop, and there they were painted.

00:58:56.503 --> 00:58:57.208
David Boder: Hm.

00:58:57.208 --> 00:59:02.822
Alexander Gertner: They were painted there. So he precisely selected me and another Jew. ‘You go to the paint shop.’

00:59:02.822 --> 00:59:03.365
David Boder: Hm.

00:59:03.365 --> 00:59:10.064
Alexander Gertner: In the paint shop. We come in there. There was the...the foreman, also a prisoner, a Pole, a gentile.

00:59:10.064 --> 00:59:10.468
David Boder: Hm.

00:59:10.468 --> 00:59:18.733
Alexander Gertner: It was [mockingly:], ‘Ah, a Kike, a Jew.’ A Kike, for us. Where, what...[without concern] what language one knows.

00:59:18.733 --> 00:59:21.215
David Boder: Hm.

00:59:21.215 --> 00:59:24.209
Alexander Gertner: Good, so here we had to work.

00:59:24.209 --> 00:59:25.034
David Boder: Hm.

00:59:25.034 --> 00:59:43.540
Alexander Gertner: What was our assigned work to be? We had to shine the autos clean. The autos had to...the old paint, the old metal, the old paint had to be scraped off. We had to crawl under the cars and everything. Dirt went into the eyes. Everything had to be cleaned well so that the auto could be sprayed. Nothing should remain of the old [paint].

00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:45.028
David Boder: You sprayed the...

00:59:45.028 --> 00:59:46.426
Alexander Gertner: I didn’t spray, the overseer did.

00:59:46.426 --> 00:59:48.197
David Boder: Yes, but with [words not clear].

00:59:48.197 --> 00:59:48.499
Alexander Gertner: [Words not clear].

00:59:48.499 --> 00:59:49.119
David Boder: [Words not clear].

00:59:49.119 --> 01:00:04.462
Alexander Gertner: Yes. And so this...in this hall were...the work there was terribly dirty, with dust. We killed ourselves and...but yet it was under a roof, not out in the rain. The construction of the air-raid shelters was still outside.

01:00:04.462 --> 01:00:08.800
David Boder: Well then [?]...

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:22.607
Alexander Gertner: Yes, and then we were there under the master. He was yelling that we should hurry up. A car came. He finished it fast, because he received some food from the SS. The master got it. He used to get sometimes a bread...

01:00:22.607 --> 01:00:23.342
David Boder: He was a prisoner?

01:00:23.342 --> 01:00:40.342
Alexander Gertner: ...a little margarine. He was a prisoner, a gentile. He never gave us anything. I found once some carrots in a car. He saw when I brought them in. He was ready to kill me. To starve so badly [?]...and [he] scolded me for taking them.

01:00:40.342 --> 01:00:43.366
David Boder: Hm. They were there in the car?

01:00:43.366 --> 01:01:15.626
Alexander Gertner: Yes. And so in this...in this detail I worked. The detail was horrible, because by then it was already winter, September, October, December. It was winter. We had to go out very early, at six o’clock. It was three kilometers from Auschwitz, from the camp. We had to march quickly, because we couldn’t take more than ten, fifteen minutes to get there. It was terrible with the wooden soles. We had wooden shoes, such thick wooden shoes. The snow stuck underneath the shoes.

01:01:15.626 --> 01:01:16.994
David Boder: The snow stuck, nu?

01:01:16.994 --> 01:01:20.590
Alexander Gertner: The snow stuck to the shoes, so we couldn’t walk, because they are round [Dutch type wooden shoes].

01:01:20.590 --> 01:01:21.524
David Boder: Hm.

01:01:21.524 --> 01:01:31.144
Alexander Gertner: And then we were...like this we...I worked there in that detail approximately, well, till the last...till January, till January the 15th.

01:01:31.144 --> 01:01:32.319
David Boder: Hm.

01:01:32.319 --> 01:02:18.802
Alexander Gertner: It was...this detail was...was...was very bad, because of the marching there and the hard work, but it wasn’t half as bad as for the others. Other details were worse yet. There were better ones and worse ones. And so we were...at the end the legs were frozen from the...from the marching, from the snow, from standing outside. Sometimes there was an appell. For instance, some were missing. Russian [prisoners] often escaped from the lager. They ran away, and if the count wasn’t right....In the evening when we were returning from the lager...[correction] from work, we stood on appell, counted every night, everyone in front of his barrack. The barrack chief came. He had to hand in to the SS how many people he has, and the SS man had to hand in to the report chief. The report chief handed it to the lager
                        commandant.

01:02:18.802 --> 01:02:19.537
David Boder: Hm.

01:02:19.537 --> 01:02:34.368
Alexander Gertner: We all had to stand with the hats off outside in the snow, in the worst frosts. And if one was missing, we stood approximately for two, three hours. One could...and if he wasn’t found, we had to go outside in the morning before work and stand again for two, three hours.

01:02:34.368 --> 01:02:38.476
David Boder: If you were standing [idle] before going to work then you were not working.

01:02:38.476 --> 01:03:00.880
Alexander Gertner: No, so we got up earlier. We got up earlier. We had to, if it was known so we should not...that...if the count wasn’t right. And so I worked till...till...till the 15th of January there in that Trage Halle. On the 15th we couldn’t work there any more. There had been bombings not far from there. The railroad station was bombed.

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:02.025
David Boder: Who had bombed it?

01:03:02.025 --> 01:03:03.664
Alexander Gertner: The Americans probably.

01:03:03.664 --> 01:03:04.700
David Boder: Hm.

01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:14.080
Alexander Gertner: And...and the road was bombed. We couldn’t go, so we remained in the block. We worked there inside the lager, whatever there was to do, various labors, heavy labors.

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:17.616
David Boder: How did the SS feel during the bombing? How did they...

01:03:17.616 --> 01:03:24.996
Alexander Gertner: They...they were terribly excited. They...in one word, they wanted to devour us. Then they were terribly enraged when bombing occurred.

01:03:24.996 --> 01:03:25.942
David Boder: Hm.

01:03:25.942 --> 01:03:52.171
Alexander Gertner: There was a bombing raid once. I remember, we were then at work. A bombing occurred. We were there on the road on which we marched from the lager to the Trage Halle. There were nearby the SS barracks. And there were at the same time also...prisoners working there. There were nearby factories, leather, shoe-repair shops, tailoring shops, various kinds. And so there had been killed at that time eighty SS men and approximately a hundred prisoners also.

01:03:52.171 --> 01:03:52.846
David Boder: Hm.

01:03:52.846 --> 01:04:27.600
Alexander Gertner: They were terrified [?], the SS, altogether. In the confusion [?] they wanted to devour the whole camp. We were told to fall in at once, in the middle of work, immediately to return to camp. We didn’t know what went on. And so towards the end there were air-raids every day and night. Yom Kippur [Day of Atonement] and Rosh Hashana [New Year’s] we had at least, thank God...we could go into the air-raid shelter. During an air-raid we could conduct a little service. We could say a Shemona Esra [the principle section, the high points of the services]. We could unburden ourselves a bit by weeping. When we saw that there were air-raids...

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:30.473
David Boder: Were you permitted to go into shelters?

01:04:30.473 --> 01:04:41.961
Alexander Gertner: It was so. During a raid...there was there such a shelter [?], such a bunker had been made with...with trees around and around, so strewn around so that it should not be seen that there are people, because if there are people...

01:04:41.961 --> 01:04:42.172
David Boder: Hm.

01:04:42.172 --> 01:04:43.648
Alexander Gertner: ...they were afraid that they will be bombed, the SS.

01:04:43.648 --> 01:04:44.190
David Boder: Nu?

01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:50.063
Alexander Gertner: So we were sent into the bunker. We had to run in there. And this could last for an hour or two, till the raid passed.

01:04:50.063 --> 01:04:50.606
David Boder: Yes.

01:04:50.606 --> 01:05:13.744
Alexander Gertner: And during such time we could pray a little. Then...so it went on till the 18th of January. On the 18th of January we...we had to...in the morning, still on the 15th, a transport had left...left. And later it was said that the whole camp has to leave. Yes, I forgot...

01:05:13.744 --> 01:05:16.196
David Boder: All that happened when you were in Birken-...

01:05:16.196 --> 01:05:16.961
Alexander Gertner: Then in Auschwitz.

01:05:16.961 --> 01:05:18.527
David Boder: In Auschwitz, not Birkenau.

01:05:18.527 --> 01:05:56.609
Alexander Gertner: I forgot to mention this. In the meantime, two months before, there was a selection. There were selections every few weeks among the sick, various ones who looked weak. But this selection was for the whole camp. Everybody had to...in the nude. During one night everyone naked had to pass through the bath hall. Whoever looked weak or...on one side stood the report chief, on the other side the clerk. And whose ever number he wrote down, they were immediately gathered and taken away to the crematory. For seven hundred people it was to be taken away at that time. The date was between Rosh Hoshana [New Year’s]...between Rosh Hoshana and the Holy Day, approxiamately.

01:05:56.609 --> 01:05:57.633
David Boder: When?

01:05:57.633 --> 01:05:59.350
Alexander Gertner: This happened.

01:05:59.350 --> 01:06:00.687
David Boder: Between Rosh Hoshana and what?

01:06:00.687 --> 01:06:01.573
Alexander Gertner: And the Holy Day [in Hebrew].

01:06:01.573 --> 01:06:02.489
David Boder: What is that?

01:06:02.489 --> 01:06:04.308
Alexander Gertner: That is a religious [term]. The Holy Day is...

01:06:04.308 --> 01:06:05.122
David Boder: When?

01:06:05.122 --> 01:06:05.827
Alexander Gertner: ...Yom Kippur.

01:06:05.827 --> 01:06:07.767
David Boder: Yes, nu?

01:06:07.767 --> 01:06:35.834
Alexander Gertner: And so on the 18the of January we all went away. For the road we were given a bread and a little margarine. We were marching. There was heavy snow. We were told to fall in and all have to leave quickly. We saw the SS burned everything. The papers that were in the lager and everything was burned. And the sick remained there in the lager. Everybody who could walk had to fall in, and we left on Thursday.

01:06:35.834 --> 01:06:37.370
David Boder: And the women?

01:06:37.370 --> 01:06:40.352
Alexander Gertner: The women were not with us in the lager. We were only men.

01:06:40.352 --> 01:06:40.653
David Boder: Nu?

01:06:40.653 --> 01:07:09.548
Alexander Gertner: The women also marched. They were in Birkenau, in another lager. And so on the 18th of January we went away, on Thursday afternoon. I remember, in the heaviest snow we march at night. We don’t know where we are going, with things which we had with us. And we marched like this for two days and two nights. In front of us marched the women from Birkenau. We marched altogether thirty thousand people. Birkenau went. Buna was another lager.

01:07:09.548 --> 01:07:10.042
David Boder: Hm.

01:07:10.042 --> 01:07:14.662
Alexander Gertner: And in that Buna, alas, had been my fater. I...I...

01:07:14.662 --> 01:07:15.295
David Boder: In Buna was...

01:07:15.295 --> 01:07:23.831
Alexander Gertner: In Buna, my fater. I didn’t see him. In October, ’44, there had come...there had come a few people from Buna to Auschwitz.

01:07:23.831 --> 01:07:23.994
David Boder: Hm.

01:07:23.994 --> 01:07:25.874
Alexander Gertner: They came as skilled workers, [since] they had reported as skilled people.

01:07:25.874 --> 01:07:26.235
David Boder: Yes?

01:07:26.235 --> 01:07:28.102
Alexander Gertner: They came to work in the shoe shop.

01:07:28.102 --> 01:07:29.940
David Boder: Nu?

01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:40.133
Alexander Gertner: So they told me—they knew my father—that—I asked all the details—that my father is in Buna, that he is working inside the lager, [that] he was a weak person so he couldn’t work outside.

01:07:40.133 --> 01:07:40.778
David Boder: Hm.

01:07:40.778 --> 01:07:44.736
Alexander Gertner: So I ask them, and towards the end he left with a transport for Gleiwitz.

01:07:44.736 --> 01:07:45.230
David Boder: Where to?

01:07:45.230 --> 01:07:47.350
Alexander Gertner: To Gleiwitz. Gleiwitz [number] one it was called.

01:07:47.350 --> 01:07:48.706
David Boder: What was that?

01:07:48.706 --> 01:07:49.923
Alexander Gertner: It was also a lager.

01:07:49.923 --> 01:07:50.537
David Boder: Hm.

01:07:50.537 --> 01:08:18.927
Alexander Gertner: So I...every Sunday I used to wait for the car. They used to transport the food to Buna. From Auschwitz they used to send the food to Buna. It was approximately thirty kilometers from us. But to meet someone there so I could send a letter with him, that was impossible. And so in [from] that Buna also went [people] with the transport in which we marched. There were there [people from] Buna, Birkenau, all of Birkenau, and all the surrounding lagers around Auschwitz.

01:08:18.927 --> 01:08:19.704
David Boder: Nu?

01:08:19.704 --> 01:08:24.897
Alexander Gertner: And then we marched, approximately thirty thousand people, two nights and two...

01:08:24.897 --> 01:08:26.415
David Boder: Thirty thousand people?

01:08:26.415 --> 01:08:45.162
Alexander Gertner: Thirty thousand people. A...a line [file] of a few kilometers [long]. When...when the sentries wanted to give some sort of a signal, from one end to the others, they would fire in the air. They already had made up signals, one shot, etc. They could not call each other in any other way.

01:08:45.162 --> 01:08:47.523
David Boder: How could you know how many there were [?]?

01:08:47.523 --> 01:08:52.475
Alexander Gertner: So big was the...only toward the end we found out how many people were marching together.

01:08:52.475 --> 01:08:55.728
David Boder: Nu. So where did you go [?]?

01:08:55.728 --> 01:09:02.216
Alexander Gertner: We marched. Only at night could we march, because in the daytime they were afraid, because there could be air-raids.

01:09:02.216 --> 01:09:03.132
David Boder: So. [Words not clear].

01:09:03.132 --> 01:09:04.590
Alexander Gertner: Yes. We [?]...

01:09:04.590 --> 01:09:06.620
David Boder: So what were you doing during the day?

01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:15.566
Alexander Gertner: During the day we sat in the snow, sometimes by peasants. We sat in yards [word may also mean farms], in the barns, wherever...wherever we could.

01:09:15.566 --> 01:09:16.632
David Boder: Hm.

01:09:16.632 --> 01:09:22.909
Alexander Gertner: In front of us marched the women. And very...and very many women remained behind who couldn’t march.

01:09:22.909 --> 01:09:23.523
David Boder: And?

01:09:23.523 --> 01:09:32.421
Alexander Gertner: These were shot. And all the people who marched in the column, if one said, ‘I can’t march,’ or broke formation to the left or to the right...

01:09:32.421 --> 01:09:32.915
David Boder: Hm.

01:09:32.915 --> 01:09:34.252
Alexander Gertner: ...he shot you immediately.

01:09:34.252 --> 01:09:35.728
David Boder: Did you yourself see that?

01:09:35.728 --> 01:09:46.824
Alexander Gertner: I saw it myself, how near me people were shot. And while going forward we already saw from the people ahead, from the people who were walking ahead of us, many people who had been shot. And so...

01:09:46.824 --> 01:09:47.758
David Boder: On the sides [of the road].

01:09:47.758 --> 01:09:56.644
Alexander Gertner: On the side of the road. Always many, many...clouds of people. And so we marched till Breslau. We made ninety kilometers [about 55 miles] in two nights.

01:09:56.644 --> 01:09:59.608
David Boder: Nu?

01:09:59.608 --> 01:10:40.792
Alexander Gertner: And in Breslau we already were not able to march. I already said...I was there with a comrade. We were marching together. So I said, ‘If that keeps on much longer, so I...’ [words not clear]. On the second night I said to him, ‘I can’t any more.’ I already wanted to fall behind, and what will do [happen]. So he said...he heard me moaning [?], so he said to me, ‘Wait a little. We are already arriving...we are already at...we will stop marching.’ And so we came in the morning. We arrived very early. At four o’clock we arrived in Breslau. And there we see near a station black smoke. We come closer. We find two trains standing there, two large trains. Two trains...

01:10:40.792 --> 01:10:41.647
David Boder: One moment. Railroad trains?

01:10:41.647 --> 01:10:47.250
Alexander Gertner: Railroad trains, and...

01:10:47.250 --> 01:10:49.310
David Boder: Nu?

01:10:49.310 --> 01:11:02.985
Alexander Gertner: And so Jews are saying one to another, ‘There must be two trains. One is going to Buchenwald. One is going to Grossrosen.’

01:11:02.985 --> 01:11:04.051
David Boder: Yes.

01:11:04.051 --> 01:11:16.130
Alexander Gertner: So I said to him, ‘It is best to be in the train to Buchenwald. There already...’ [words not clear]. How do we know? We don’t know anything. And so we understood that maybe the first train goes to Buchenwald, because Buchenwald was better known.

01:11:16.130 --> 01:11:17.076
David Boder: Yes.

01:11:17.076 --> 01:11:44.932
Alexander Gertner: So we started pushing to be loaded on the first train. And so from all sides people dragged, dragged from all sides. There were terribly many people, around thirty thousand people. [Words not clear.] When we were loaded....We were taken eighty-five, ninety people in open wagons [RR-cars]. They were half...half wagons [flatcars or gondolas]. Such wagons for lumber...

01:11:44.932 --> 01:11:45.143
David Boder: Yes.

01:11:45.143 --> 01:11:48.808
Alexander Gertner: ....they were [?]. It was terribly cold then.

01:11:48.808 --> 01:11:49.225
David Boder: Nu?

01:11:49.225 --> 01:12:14.822
Alexander Gertner: We were embarked there, and so I and another few, we were there together, and we don’t know where we are traveling to, but we are traveling. It was frightfully cold. We traveled for one night. And then during that night my finger froze off, the thumb, and so the cold at that time was terrible. We didn’t have anything to eat. And so we rode for approximately thirty-six hours.

01:12:14.822 --> 01:12:15.876
David Boder: Hm. Nu?

01:12:15.876 --> 01:12:18.087
Alexander Gertner: Then we arrived in Grossrosen.

01:12:18.087 --> 01:12:20.659
David Boder: Yes?

01:12:20.659 --> 01:12:25.810
Alexander Gertner: Arriving in Grossrosen, we were unloaded from the wagons, and we march on foot for quite a while.

01:12:25.810 --> 01:12:27.057
David Boder: A bit louder.

01:12:27.057 --> 01:12:36.406
Alexander Gertner: We...we...we walk for quite a while. And we walked up on a ...we see we are walking up kind of a hill. There was a big hill. The lager was on a hill.

01:12:36.406 --> 01:12:38.165
David Boder: Oh, so you did not go to Buchenwald?

01:12:38.165 --> 01:12:40.075
Alexander Gertner: No, it happened that we didn’t go to Buchenwald.

01:12:40.075 --> 01:12:40.606
David Boder: Yes.

01:12:40.606 --> 01:12:42.846
Alexander Gertner: Because we wanted to go to Buchenwald we went to Grossrosen.

01:12:42.846 --> 01:12:43.732
David Boder: Nu?

01:12:43.732 --> 01:13:20.323
Alexander Gertner: Grossrosen was a dreadful lager. We arrived up there. The old lager was so...the old lager this was [words not clear]. A lot of people had arrived, so they...so they built new barracks on top of the hill. It was made with...with...with barbed wires around. New barracks were built. There were dreadful morasses and slush. There...we were brought there to the top. There was not yet any water supply [pipes]. We were pushed in there together with about twelve hundred people into one barrack.

01:13:20.323 --> 01:13:21.709
David Boder: Hm.

01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:24.552
Alexander Gertner: In there it was frightfully dirty...

01:13:24.552 --> 01:13:29.323
David Boder: Grossrosen is near what city?

01:13:29.323 --> 01:13:35.419
Alexander Gertner: This was in deep Germany, as it was called. The Seven Mountains [incorrect].

01:13:35.419 --> 01:13:37.118
David Boder: In the Thueringer Mountains?

01:13:37.118 --> 01:13:38.094
Alexander Gertner: In the Thueringer Mountains [also incorrect].

01:13:38.094 --> 01:13:38.377
David Boder: Yes.

01:13:38.377 --> 01:13:40.287
Alexander Gertner: I am not so familiar with Germany [?].

01:13:40.287 --> 01:13:42.618
David Boder: Hm.

01:13:42.618 --> 01:13:43.100
Alexander Gertner: And so...

01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:48.082
David Boder: Near what large German city is it?

01:13:48.082 --> 01:13:49.492
Alexander Gertner: I don’t know where about it is.

01:13:49.492 --> 01:13:50.233
David Boder: Nu?

01:13:50.233 --> 01:14:26.794
Alexander Gertner: And so we were there in Gross-...we were loca-...there were terribly many people. We were disembarked to be distributed. We were terribly many people. They yelled for us to form a line. People were hungry, and one didn’t know what to do. Later, after we had stayed there overnight in that block, twelve hundred people, in the morning we were again told to get up, early around two [a.m.], to fetch something to eat. At that time there was brought something like water made out of grits [?]. It looked like water from the grits [word mispronouced].

01:14:26.794 --> 01:14:27.860
David Boder: What is grits?

01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:28.474
Alexander Gertner: Well...

01:14:28.474 --> 01:14:28.866
David Boder: Groats?

01:14:28.866 --> 01:14:29.691
Alexander Gertner: Groats, yes.

01:14:29.691 --> 01:14:30.113
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

01:14:30.113 --> 01:14:46.812
Alexander Gertner: And this...this was called the dinner, tomorrow’s dinner for the next day. This was at two o’clock at night. Why did they do it this way? Because there had arrived so many people, so many new people, that they couldn’t...

01:14:46.812 --> 01:14:49.896
David Boder: And so...

01:14:49.896 --> 01:15:13.755
Alexander Gertner: There were no eating utensils at all. We had brought some with us from Auschwitz, these cans, the empty cans from canned food. We had been given some canned food [there], so we kept the cans, and now we were given the soup in them, dirty cans. And so we were dead hungry, and as long as we had something to eat [we ate]. We ate snow. That snow was our water, the snow.

01:15:13.755 --> 01:15:14.189
David Boder: Hm.

01:15:14.189 --> 01:15:33.538
Alexander Gertner: With snow we washed. Snow we drank. Everything. And so in this...there I was for a few days. There we were led from one barrack to another, because every day there were arriving new people. Everybody was pushed [crowded] together. New people were arriving, because everywhere...the Russians were pushing from one side and the Americans...

01:15:33.538 --> 01:15:34.152
David Boder: Nu?

01:15:34.152 --> 01:15:38.230
Alexander Gertner: So from all the lagers they brought them to Grossrosen.

01:15:38.230 --> 01:15:38.833
David Boder: Nu?

01:15:38.833 --> 00:00:00.000
Alexander Gertner: And [some] to Buchenwald. Mostly to Grossrosen and [a blank on the recording wire]...got work, those who were skilled workers. Again people with skills, so I reported as...with the skilled people. I was also in carpentry, and we were...we were taken, approximately three hundred people, and we were taken to a separate block. Various locksmiths, carpenters, and various skilled people. There in that block it was also very dreadful, because we were...we were given little food. We couldn’t go out. We were told we are leaving any moment. We didn’t know, because we were told we will be leaving. We were happy that we would be leaving.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: Hm.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Alexander Gertner: Whether everybody was going, we did not know anything. Everybody still remained. Later in a few days comes one...a superior group leader takes us over. We were written down [registered] fifteen times. We were...we were told, ‘If you won’t know the trade well, then you will be killed for that...’

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: What?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Alexander Gertner: Who had reported [as a tradesman], you understand? The trade that we had reported, if we won’t know it well...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: Hm.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Alexander Gertner: We were registered. We were led out of the lager. Everyone is given a liter of soup. This was the food to take along [for the road]. And we are led out. On the street one comes with a gun [?], a superior group leader, ‘Whoever leaves the formation will be immediately shot.’

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: Hm.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Alexander Gertner: There were sentries. There were sentries around. We march in snow, in mud. It was a dreadful road. We don’t know where we are going. We are marching for approximately thirty kilometers, from Grossrosen...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: Nu?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Alexander Gertner: And so we thank God that we are leaving Grossrosen. We don’t know yet where we are going—as long as we are leaving Grossrosen. We march and we march. We are already too tired. We can’t march any more. And so we see there, in the distance on a hill, we see there a lager, a small camp.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: Nu?

00:00:00.000 --> 01:15:50.532
Alexander Gertner: So we believe maybe we are going to this lager. We are coming closer and closer. We see we are really going into this lager. We enter the lager. [Near the end of this spool the voice is very faint.] At the gate in front of the lager, at the gate there steps forward the man [?] who brought the report [list], the lager
                        commandant. There was in Grossrosen...there came the lager elder. He, too, was a prisoner...

01:15:50.532 --> 01:16:02.699
David Boder: [In English:] August the 26th, 1946, at about ten o’clock in the evening. We continue, the third spool with Mr. Gertner.

01:16:02.699 --> 01:16:04.490
David Boder: [In Yiddish:] And so you came out...

01:16:04.490 --> 01:16:32.057
Alexander Gertner: We...we came to the Heim, to the camp Bolkenhain [Home in the Clouds]. That camp was called Bolkenhain. So there comes out the lager...the lager elder and tells us, ‘Yes, you should know’...asks us where...where we are from...well, in which camp we had been before. We told him we were in Auschwitz and we were finally in Grossrosen. ‘Yes, you were in Auschwitz. Good. But it happens that here is not Auschwitz. Here you are [word not clear]. Here I will teach you!’

01:16:32.057 --> 01:16:33.394
David Boder: What?

01:16:33.394 --> 01:16:53.255
Alexander Gertner: Good. He counts us. He carries such a cudgel in his hand. Nu, he counts us and leads us into the lager. In the lager he threw us into a room, a narrow one, such a room. Thus all the three hundred people...we were...one narrow...we couldn’t turn around, not to the right, not to the left. ‘Turn in everything.’ What one has with us. Good. Everything turned in. One...

01:16:53.255 --> 01:16:54.351
David Boder: What did you have?

01:16:54.351 --> 01:16:58.761
Alexander Gertner: A shaving apparatus so a...to shave. One had various things. One had a...

01:16:58.761 --> 01:17:06.062
David Boder: Now as long as you talk about it, about shaving, how often did one shave? How did one go to work? Or did one grow a beard?

01:17:06.062 --> 01:17:10.381
Alexander Gertner: No. One had to be shaved. One had to shave. Every week one shaved himself once.

01:17:10.381 --> 01:17:11.357
David Boder: Once a week one shaved.

01:17:11.357 --> 01:17:11.911
Alexander Gertner: Yes, and...

01:17:11.911 --> 01:17:13.429
David Boder: And who did the shaving?

01:17:13.429 --> 01:17:14.634
Alexander Gertner: One another.

01:17:14.634 --> 01:17:15.248
David Boder: One another.

01:17:15.248 --> 01:17:21.254
Alexander Gertner: If one didn’t [couldn’t] shave, he gave away the bread for a shave. There was...officially there was a...a barrack barber.

01:17:21.254 --> 01:17:21.465
David Boder: Yes.

01:17:21.465 --> 01:17:26.477
Alexander Gertner: But this block barber was also a dog, also one of the prisoners. He wanted to get a cigarette for a shave.

01:17:26.477 --> 01:17:26.688
David Boder: Nu.

01:17:26.688 --> 01:17:27.724
Alexander Gertner: He wanted some...

01:17:27.724 --> 01:17:32.284
David Boder: Were you permitted to keep...were you permitted to keep razors?

01:17:32.284 --> 01:17:44.965
Alexander Gertner: Yes, it was permitted [possible] to keep razors for shaving, but on the sly. It wasn’t permitted to keep any. Only the barrack barber had to do the shaving, but...but who could wait? There were in one barrack a few hundred people. Who could wait for the block barber? All on one Sunday, one Sunday...

01:17:44.965 --> 01:17:46.483
David Boder: Did one have soap?

01:17:46.483 --> 01:17:53.923
Alexander Gertner: We had. We received every month or every two months one piece of soap, but it was...this soap was just stone, only stone, a piece of stone.

01:17:53.923 --> 01:17:54.658
David Boder: Nu?

01:17:54.658 --> 01:17:56.869
Alexander Gertner: And so we have...

01:17:56.869 --> 01:17:57.453
David Boder: And the hair?

01:17:57.453 --> 01:18:09.652
Alexander Gertner: And the hair had to be cut, cut the same as shaved. Well, not smooth, but only every week one cut the hair. Whoever went to work not shaven or without a haircut, he...he caught a terrible beating.

01:18:09.652 --> 01:18:12.285
David Boder: Hm.

01:18:12.285 --> 01:18:44.733
Alexander Gertner: And so when we entered this camp Bolkenhain, we were...there we were told to hand over everything. And then we started, a few people at a time...this was a small camp. There was no bath hall. There was only a bathtub [tank] to wash, such a sort made of cement. And we were told to go in a few people at a time. We washed up. There was a barber. He cut off everybody’s hair, and one was asked, ‘Where are you from? Do you have any gold on you?’ The prisoners were told to search among themselves. They should hand over everything. All they wanted was to get something.

01:18:44.733 --> 01:18:46.191
David Boder: Hm.

01:18:46.191 --> 01:18:57.137
Alexander Gertner: Good. We bathed a few people at a time. It was already about the middle of the night, because it went very slowly, because only...only two, three people went in at one time, because there was only one bathtub.

01:18:57.137 --> 01:18:57.962
David Boder: Only one bathtub?

01:18:57.962 --> 01:19:03.034
Alexander Gertner: So there were two holes made out of cement. So there water was poured in.

01:19:03.034 --> 01:19:03.637
David Boder: Not...

01:19:03.637 --> 01:19:04.143
Alexander Gertner: Not showers.

01:19:04.143 --> 01:19:04.414
David Boder: Hm.

01:19:04.414 --> 01:19:06.896
Alexander Gertner: There were no showers. No showers were there. And so...

01:19:06.896 --> 01:19:08.806
David Boder: So one went in the same water with the...

01:19:08.806 --> 01:19:32.531
Alexander Gertner: The same as the other, yes. Thousands. Everyone went in the same water. And after washing—and this lasted till approximately two o’clock at night—we were led into a block there. There was straw strewn out, straw. Five people were given one...one...one blanked. We arranged ourselves in a row, in fives, one close to the other. One blanket was given to every five people. Finished.

01:19:32.531 --> 01:19:34.109
David Boder: How can people cover themselves?

01:19:34.109 --> 01:19:37.935
Alexander Gertner: That is how we had to cover ourselves, five people with one blanket. Squeezed together exactly like herring.

01:19:37.935 --> 01:19:39.242
David Boder: The blanket was put lengthwise?

01:19:39.242 --> 01:19:40.327
Alexander Gertner: Lengthwise, yes.

01:19:40.327 --> 01:19:41.875
David Boder: Nu?

01:19:41.875 --> 01:20:05.321
Alexander Gertner: In the morning we were again registered. Someone came, wrote down exactly from where we are, from which lager, what number one has. We already had the third number. In every lager one was given a new prison number. And when this was over [a short blank in the wire]...and so we were...

01:20:05.321 --> 01:20:05.687
David Boder: Nu?

01:20:05.687 --> 01:20:19.795
Alexander Gertner: In the morning all the particulars were taken down. We were received, and he said, ‘Here you will be taught!’ This camp elder was a terribly evil man. There exists no worse. We were recieved. On the next day...

01:20:19.795 --> 01:20:21.072
David Boder: When was that approximately?

01:20:21.072 --> 01:20:27.909
Alexander Gertner: That was approximately four weeks...approximately in February—January, February. Approximately in the middle of February.

01:20:27.909 --> 01:20:29.295
David Boder: In ’45?

01:20:29.295 --> 01:20:30.452
Alexander Gertner: Yes, in ’45.

01:20:30.452 --> 01:20:30.765
David Boder: Yes.

01:20:30.765 --> 01:20:32.163
Alexander Gertner: At the end, oh, in [word not clear].

01:20:32.163 --> 01:20:32.988
David Boder: That was shortly [?] before the liberation?

01:20:32.988 --> 01:20:33.512
Alexander Gertner: Yes.

01:20:33.512 --> 01:20:35.440
David Boder: Yes, nu?

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:54.338
Alexander Gertner: Yes, approximately at the end of...so at the beginning of February, because it was Yier [ the name of the Jewish month]. And then when we had been there a few days, there all day long we had to make [punitive] sports. We had to do...run, genuflexions, run again. And the beatings if one did there something [?]. The camp there was dreadful. Lice were crawling all over.

01:20:54.338 --> 01:20:54.952
David Boder: Lice?

01:20:54.952 --> 01:21:08.669
Alexander Gertner: Lice. When we came we were clean. We came from Auschwitz, and there it was clean [at certain times and in certain sections—DPB]. Auschwitz was terrible, but besides that, one thing was good, that it was clean in Auschwitz. If one louse was found on someone, the whole block was disinfected.

01:21:08.669 --> 01:21:09.615
David Boder: Nu?

01:21:09.615 --> 01:21:12.579
Alexander Gertner: And there in Camp Bolkenhain it was terribly dirty.

01:21:12.579 --> 01:21:20.151
David Boder: Now how do you explain that. The Americans were coming from one side and the Russians from the other side.

01:21:20.151 --> 01:21:20.434
Alexander Gertner: Yes.

01:21:20.434 --> 01:21:21.862
David Boder: It was necessary to evacuate.

01:21:21.862 --> 01:21:22.446
Alexander Gertner: Yes.

01:21:22.446 --> 01:21:27.819
David Boder: And yet the SS men were so mean. Did they think that they were going to win the war?

01:21:27.819 --> 01:21:34.777
Alexander Gertner: No, they didn’t think that they would win. They simply wanted to exterminate. They had received an order to move on and to endure, whoever can’t march should be shot.

01:21:34.777 --> 01:21:35.723
David Boder: Nu?

01:21:35.723 --> 01:21:38.837
Alexander Gertner: Did they need us for anything? They wanted to exterminate.

01:21:38.837 --> 01:21:41.349
David Boder: Hm. And so there were lice in that lager.

01:21:41.349 --> 01:21:42.885
Alexander Gertner: Yes. And so we were...

01:21:42.885 --> 01:21:44.723
David Boder: What was the name of that lager?

01:21:44.723 --> 01:21:45.669
Alexander Gertner: Bolkenhain.

01:21:45.669 --> 01:21:46.314
David Boder: Bolkenhain.

01:21:46.314 --> 01:21:55.814
Alexander Gertner: Yes. And after we had spent there a few days we began working. What did we do? We dug pits [words not clear]...nearby in the forest [?].

01:21:55.814 --> 01:21:56.326
David Boder: Pits?

01:21:56.326 --> 01:21:58.055
Alexander Gertner: Pits. Long pits.

01:21:58.055 --> 01:21:59.001
David Boder: What for?

01:21:59.001 --> 01:22:12.115
Alexander Gertner: What do you mean, what for? At first we didn’t know, but later we found out. Everyone was told. We made heavy, deep [?] pits. And we brought wood from the forest. We had to cut wood. We put it around on the sides. Lime was put all around so...lime on top so it shouldn’t be seen what...what it was for [?].

01:22:12.115 --> 01:22:12.688
David Boder: Hm.

01:22:12.688 --> 01:22:25.471
Alexander Gertner: We dug pits. What for? We were there. In that lager the food was especially terrible. There was very little food, and the beatings became worse every day. There were Jewish lager elders, too. And they, too, beat [us] terribly.

01:22:25.471 --> 01:22:26.013
David Boder: Who?

01:22:26.013 --> 01:22:26.616
Alexander Gertner: Polish Jews.

01:22:26.616 --> 01:22:27.170
David Boder: Capos?

01:22:27.170 --> 01:22:27.882
Alexander Gertner: Capos.

01:22:27.882 --> 01:22:28.382
David Boder: Hm.

01:22:28.382 --> 01:22:35.171
Alexander Gertner: Such block leaders. They have...who...whoever was a block leader there, he had to be a...a murderer!

01:22:35.171 --> 01:22:37.039
David Boder: Nu?

01:22:37.039 --> 01:22:37.985
Alexander Gertner: And so...

01:22:37.985 --> 01:22:41.160
David Boder: What did they beat you with? With sticks or what?

01:22:41.160 --> 01:23:17.841
Alexander Gertner: With anything they could lay their hands on. They beat with sticks and with stones, with whatever there was. There was not one set thing [procedure]. If someone was reported...if he [the capo] himself did the beating, it was gold [fortunate], because if he had reported to the lager leader, the prisoner would catch twenty-five with the cudgel. This one could not survive. For the smallest trifle one was given twenty-five with a stick. In Auschwitz it happened, too. But in Auschwitz not...not for every trifle. For instance, if one brought something into the lager, some food or anything, if he was caught with tobacco...for instance, I, too, was caught once. I was lucky that I wasn’t beaten, because...because the SS man was one who wanted to keep the tobacco for himself, so he didn’t want to report me. So he didn’t report. If not, I would also have caught twenty-five.

01:23:17.841 --> 01:23:19.630
David Boder: You don’t smoke, so for what did you bring in tobacco?

01:23:19.630 --> 01:23:20.365
Alexander Gertner: For somebody else.

01:23:20.365 --> 01:23:20.829
David Boder: Huh.

01:23:20.829 --> 01:23:30.389
Alexander Gertner: The...the commandant...the overseer told me to bring in the tobacco for him so he could have tobacco. Nu, so what could one say? If I tell him that I won’t do it he will beat me.

01:23:30.389 --> 01:23:31.207
David Boder: Hm.

01:23:31.207 --> 01:23:41.882
Alexander Gertner: So in this lager it was even more terrible. For every small trifle one was beaten, twenty-five. There was someone on whom a pencil was found, or some such thing that one was not supposed to have. He immediately caught twenty-five with the stick.

01:23:41.882 --> 01:23:43.189
David Boder: It was not permitted to have a pencil?

01:23:43.189 --> 00:00:00.000
Alexander Gertner: Oh! A pencil was the worst.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: Nu?

00:00:00.000 --> 01:23:45.129
Alexander Gertner: And so we were there. We dug the pits. We didn’t know what for. We were in this lager two weeks, and...and every day we heard shooting. We heard shooting with heavy cannon [words not clear]...because the front was constantly approaching.

01:23:45.129 --> 01:23:46.527
David Boder: Nu?

01:23:46.527 --> 01:24:00.274
Alexander Gertner: [Note: Here his speech becomes very animated, and the clarity of the recording suffers a great deal.—DPB.] And so [words not clear]...the lager leader is very busy. No one knows why. Then they picked...a few days earlier yet a few people had been picked, and it was said they were called the special detail.

01:24:00.274 --> 01:24:01.190
David Boder: Hm.

01:24:01.190 --> 01:24:34.449
Alexander Gertner: What this special detail was for, nobody knew. They were given an extra piece of bread. And so quite later we found out what this special detail was for, this Sonder-Kommando. There was a sick-room, because all the sick were in there. And those sick were [killed] with injections. There was no gas chamber. It was only small lager, so they were killed with injections.

01:24:34.449 --> 01:24:35.003
David Boder: Hm.

01:24:35.003 --> 01:25:19.066
Alexander Gertner: They were given such injection as, and they were thrown into these pits. And the Sonder-Kommando had to drag them, these dead. For this they were given an extra peice of bread so they shouldn’t tell, and they should...and they should have courage [strength] to go after their job. For this the pits had been dug, because they...they wanted to leave [to evacuate the camp], so they should not have to drag themselves with the sick. So they...they would [not] have to shoot the sick later on the road. So they did it right in there. And so we see how the corpses are dragged and dragged. It was done so fast. They were dragged in a hurry, because...because there had come strong orders that we have to leave. And so we had no time to distribute the dinner. The dinner remained standing there—I still remember—in the caldrons. There were metal caldrons. It remained standing, because everything had to be done fast. The lager
                        commandant came in with the cudgel. ‘Out immediately,’ he says, ‘or I’ll shoot you all down,’ he said.

01:25:19.066 --> 01:25:21.295
David Boder: Did the lager elder have a revolver?

01:25:21.295 --> 01:25:22.301
Alexander Gertner: The commandant, the lager
                        commandant.

01:25:22.301 --> 01:25:22.873
David Boder: Yes, nu?

01:25:22.873 --> 01:25:25.024
Alexander Gertner: The lager elder did not have a gun, because he was a prisoner, too.

01:25:25.024 --> 01:25:27.295
David Boder: Nu?

01:25:27.295 --> 01:25:47.247
Alexander Gertner: And so we had to get outside fast. And we started marching. Marching. We don’t know where. Already earlier carts had been prepared, because they knew that we are going to leave. So various...all things from the camp we took along. Various things, boxes with everything, they wanted to take along. They could bear it. We had to drag them.

01:25:47.247 --> 01:25:47.530
David Boder: Hm.

01:25:47.530 --> 01:25:47.874
Alexander Gertner: We bega-...

01:25:47.874 --> 01:25:48.308
David Boder: Carts with...

01:25:48.308 --> 01:25:48.669
Alexander Gertner: Carts.

01:25:48.669 --> 01:25:49.633
David Boder: Not automobiles?

01:25:49.633 --> 01:25:50.458
Alexander Gertner: No. Carts.

01:25:50.458 --> 01:25:51.181
David Boder: With horses?

01:25:51.181 --> 01:25:52.940
Alexander Gertner: No! We were the horses [chuckles].

01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:53.482
David Boder: Oh!

01:25:53.482 --> 01:26:08.012
Alexander Gertner: Carts loaded up with things, with various boxes, with anything they liked from the camp. Rags...and a cart detail was formed. Everybody assigned. To this cart twenty men, to this cart ten men. This was the worst.

01:26:08.012 --> 01:26:10.012
David Boder: What kind of vehicles were these?

01:26:10.012 --> 01:26:10.434
Alexander Gertner: Carts. Such...

01:26:10.434 --> 01:26:10.988
David Boder: They were not [word not clear]?

01:26:10.988 --> 01:26:12.084
Alexander Gertner: No. Simple carts.

01:26:12.084 --> 01:26:12.837
David Boder: Where did they get them [?]?

01:26:12.837 --> 01:26:15.229
Alexander Gertner: These peasant carts, such simple, simple carts.

01:26:15.229 --> 01:26:15.663
David Boder: Hm.

01:26:15.663 --> 01:26:20.645
Alexander Gertner: And it was...and it was loaded with many things, nailed together with boards. And we had to drag...

01:26:20.645 --> 01:26:20.898
David Boder: Hm.

01:26:20.898 --> 01:26:31.271
Alexander Gertner: ...these carts. And this was the worst, dragging these carts. We couldn’t drag. We were weak. Drag them up hills on the road. And they beat. The cart detail always remained behind.

01:26:31.271 --> 01:26:32.025
David Boder: Hm.

01:26:32.025 --> 01:26:59.382
Alexander Gertner: The others walked on foot. It was easier for them to walk. The others were always rotated. Here came the lager
                        commandant to the back. But the lager elder did not like it. If he saw that the cart drags behind and the others already are in front, he began to beat with the cudgel so that...beat to death. I was also once at the cart. I was always on the cart detail. I was mostly on the cart detail, because they saw such a tall man, so they thought that he was strong.

01:26:59.382 --> 01:26:59.593
David Boder: Hm.

01:26:59.593 --> 01:27:20.378
Alexander Gertner: At night I used to drag myself away. Since I was not seen, I used to drag myself away, used to run to the front, so as not to be on the cart detail. Once there behind...by the carts when we had stopped a little, the SS were eating. We were not given anything, but they were eating the dinner there. So one SS man threw down the bread rinds, the burnt [crusts] of the bread. He threw it away.

01:27:20.378 --> 01:27:20.782
David Boder: Hm.

01:27:20.782 --> 01:27:50.776
Alexander Gertner: So we went to pick them up. We were so hungry. There was one...I saw others were picking them up, so I also ran to pick them up. And there was a lager-...still from Bolkenhain, a lager elder, a...a block leader, a Jew. He was still mad at me. He says, ‘I am going to tell on you to the lager-...to the lager elder. You were taking bread.’ The lager elder comes over, so he says, ‘He took bread from the sentries.’ He says, ‘Yes?’ And he begins cudgeling me. He beat me so that I was so blue, blue all over, swollen all over [?].

01:27:50.776 --> 01:27:52.204
David Boder: Did he beat you on the face with the cudgel?

01:27:52.204 --> 01:28:09.760
Alexander Gertner: With the cudgel on the face. He didn’t even look. On the face [?]. On the face, everywhere. ‘I’ll beat you here. Here you will drop.’ He says, ‘Here I beat you. Here you shall drop. Why did you [take] bread?’ I say, ‘No, Herr lager elder, I got bread.’ I still had on me the piece of bread that we took along from the lager. ‘Yes, you did take.’ He beats me up so much that I thought [?] now I am finished [Footnote: It is characteristic that all through these interviews it appears that the Nazis could not bring themselves to use the verb steal in connection with the word bread. Even in a case of execution of several prisoners who took bread from the kitchen during an air-raid alarm, the term Brot nehmen [take bread] was used and not Brot stehlen [steal bread]. —DPB.].

01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:10.905
David Boder: Hm.

01:28:10.905 --> 01:28:18.341
Alexander Gertner: I was bleeding all over [?]. And so I didn’t know what to do. The snow...I took snow. It burned me very much. I put it on my face.

01:28:18.341 --> 01:28:19.908
David Boder: Hm.

01:28:19.908 --> 01:28:29.151
Alexander Gertner: I cooled it, and keep going. We have to keep running. And here I am by the carts. It was...What shall I do? I can’t push. And so one sees that. He says, ‘You, your face is swollen. You must get out [?].’

01:28:29.151 --> 01:28:29.693
David Boder: Who said [?]?

01:28:29.693 --> 01:28:31.273
Alexander Gertner: Another one.

01:28:31.273 --> 01:28:32.026
David Boder: Yes.

01:28:32.026 --> 01:28:53.326
Alexander Gertner: So he tells me, ‘You go to the front. Don’t go [here] any more. See that you get to the front, not among the carts, because here you will be beaten to death.’ And so I have...with all my strength I dragged myself to the front. And I came to the front [of the column]. At the front there...so we came...till late at night. This was after marching for two days. Late at night we arrived in a lager, Hirshberg.

01:28:53.326 --> 01:28:55.262
David Boder: Hm. Hirshberg?

01:28:55.262 --> 01:29:19.120
Alexander Gertner: Hirshberg, that was the name of it. We come into the lager. There were already other prisoners. We were new arrivals. They were also prepared to leave, and so we were added. We entered at night. We were put into a block. And there...they were clean in that lager. We arrived lousy [words not clear]. And the next day they began it with the lice [?], and they started to beat us for having brought in the lice.

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:19.421
David Boder: Who? Who did that [?]?

01:29:19.421 --> 01:29:29.734
Alexander Gertner: Those old-timers. Those old-timers. Those others from...the other capos from among the old-timers, from among those who had already been in Hirshberg. The lager
                        commandant ran in. They made [punitive] sports with us. All day and night we had to run...

01:29:29.734 --> 01:29:31.692
David Boder: What does it mean, they made sports?

01:29:31.692 --> 01:29:42.216
Alexander Gertner: Knee-bending, standing on the head [?], and running around the walk [?] on foot [?] fast, make various gymnastics, and lying [?].

01:29:42.216 --> 01:29:42.547
David Boder: Nu?

01:29:42.547 --> 01:29:45.330
Alexander Gertner: If one couldn’t walk, with his boot he trampled him.

01:29:45.330 --> 01:29:46.143
David Boder: Hm.

01:29:46.143 --> 01:30:03.384
Alexander Gertner: And all day we had to sit in the...in the block, and we had to take off the lice and [throw them] in the basins. We had such basins with water, and we had to throw them into the water. So many were there. Imagine how many there were. In this camp it was terrible. We had brought along very many from Bolkenhain still, and so there...

01:30:03.384 --> 01:30:04.300
David Boder: What did you bring along?

01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:06.240
Alexander Gertner: Brought along these lice.

01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:06.553
David Boder: Nu?

01:30:06.553 --> 01:30:16.354
Alexander Gertner: And so in that lager we remained for approximately ten days, and then we had to leave together with that lager, together with the older...

01:30:16.354 --> 01:30:17.258
David Boder: Together with all the others?

01:30:17.258 --> 01:30:28.625
Alexander Gertner: Together with all the others. We left on foot. All of us went on foot. From there, too, we took along carts. We took along all the carts, everything they could. They wanted to take along everything so it should not remain for the Russians, for the Ger-...for the Americans.

01:30:28.625 --> 01:30:29.830
David Boder: Hm.

01:30:29.830 --> 01:30:58.462
Alexander Gertner: We took it all [?]. And then we marched till...till Waldheim. Waldheim. From there we marched for approximately a day. We did not get any food, only that which we still got in Hirshberg, a little soup. It was said that we will get food before we will be loaded on the [rr-]wagons. It was said we shall be entrained. Food for the journey, that is, rations [will be given] in the [rr-] wagons. This camp commandant, he was the worst, such a...a...a murderer that can only exist...I had already seen SS men, but he was the most terrible.

01:30:58.462 --> 01:30:59.378
David Boder: And he went along?

01:30:59.378 --> 01:31:07.191
Alexander Gertner: He went. He always, always went along. From Bolkenhain yet, from Hirshberg. He had brought us from Grossrosen to Bolkenhain. From Bolkenhain he again went with us.

01:31:07.191 --> 01:31:08.788
David Boder: Hm.

01:31:08.788 --> 01:31:39.716
Alexander Gertner: And so we came to Waldheim. We entered. It was a small lager, a tiny lager. We were put into the wash hall. There we stayed overnight. There were no barracks. There was only one barrack. We were not...we were pushed in there one against the other. One trampled on the other. We were...there were dreadful morasses there, and there we already see that the [rr-] wagons are already waiting. Well, we already thank God that we will at least be on [rr-] wagons. Possibly something will happen. And so we were entrained, twelve hundred people.

01:31:39.716 --> 01:31:41.957
David Boder: Yes. How many to each wagon?

01:31:41.957 --> 01:31:46.156
Alexander Gertner: Eighty-five, ninety people. Open wagons, half-wagons.

01:31:46.156 --> 01:31:46.861
David Boder: Oh, half-wagons.

01:31:46.861 --> 01:32:10.486
Alexander Gertner: Half-wagons. It was snowing, cold. It was frightfully cold. And so we are waiting to be given some food. Now they close the wagons. No food is given, nothing. It is too early [?]. We are traveling. Cold. Everybody had a rag. And here...that...that...that lager elder that I told you about from Bolkenhain, he was terrible, a...a...a murderer. He knew that we are going on a long journey...

01:32:10.486 --> 01:32:11.106
David Boder: Where to?

01:32:11.106 --> 01:32:14.371
Alexander Gertner: To Buchenwald, and he did not want to come along. He remained in Waldheim.

01:32:14.371 --> 01:32:15.546
David Boder: He knew that you are going to Buchenwald?

01:32:15.546 --> 01:32:20.106
Alexander Gertner: Yes, he knew. He must have found out. He remained in that Waldheim, in that small lager.

01:32:20.106 --> 01:32:20.901
David Boder: Hm.

01:32:20.901 --> 01:32:36.534
Alexander Gertner: And he...he certainly knew that we are going on such a long trip, so he wanted to make sure that we are all going to go kaput [to perish] on the way. So he ordered, for instance...we had...one two pairs of pants. One had two shirts, two jackets. We were not restrained from taking with us anything we could. We should take it along so it should not remain for the Russians.

01:32:36.534 --> 01:32:36.775
David Boder: Hm.

01:32:36.775 --> 01:32:37.106
Alexander Gertner: You understand?

01:32:37.106 --> 01:32:38.160
David Boder: Hm.

01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:48.293
Alexander Gertner: So he [the lager elder] ordered that any clothes that one had double should be taken away. And during snow! Everyone had to undress and be searched. He wanted to make sure that we shouldn’t go [word not clear].

01:32:48.293 --> 01:32:49.179
David Boder: That one should what? One shouldn’t...

01:32:49.179 --> 00:00:00.000
Alexander Gertner: That we shouldn’t enter the wagons with double clothing. That we should freeze [to death] in the wagons.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: Hm.

00:00:00.000 --> 01:33:12.673
Alexander Gertner: And it really was so! We were entrained, and we were...and we entered the wagons naked, nearly naked, with the thin trousers, no...no overcoat, in the snow. Food we did not get. And so in these wagons we traveled for six days and six nights without food. If you want to, don’t believe me!

01:33:12.673 --> 01:33:13.227
David Boder: Without...

01:33:13.227 --> 01:33:24.805
Alexander Gertner: I myself cannot...I myself can’t believe that I have endured it! In every wagon there were every morning from ten to fifteen dead. For instance, we asked one another, ‘How many dead have you? And how many dead have you?

01:33:24.805 --> 01:33:25.950
David Boder: Did you take them out?

01:33:25.950 --> 01:33:37.227
Alexander Gertner: No. We slept on the dead. We lay on top of the dead. One took off the shoes from the dead if he had other, worn out shoes. We sat on top of the dead like on a [word not clear], simply sat [on top of them]. We slept [on top of them] and everything, so high...

01:33:37.227 --> 01:33:42.107
David Boder: Now tell me. Did the dead at first...did the starved ones become sick or did they simply...

01:33:42.107 --> 01:33:44.601
Alexander Gertner: Simply have gone out from hunger, plainly from hunger.

01:33:44.601 --> 01:33:45.143
David Boder: Have gone out?

01:33:45.143 --> 01:33:58.378
Alexander Gertner: Have gone out from hunger by day and by night. There were Greeks. Because they were so...the Greeks were more terrible. They wanted to commit a dreadful deed. We didn’t permit them. They wanted to cut off flesh from...from the dead and roast it...

01:33:58.378 --> 01:33:59.023
David Boder: And eat it?

01:33:59.023 --> 01:34:01.999
Alexander Gertner: And eat it, simply eat it. They asked if anybody has matches.

01:34:01.999 --> 01:34:02.314
David Boder: Hm.

01:34:02.314 --> 01:34:06.465
Alexander Gertner: They had a piece of [wooden] board. But we said, ‘I will die together with everybody and shall not eat human flesh.’

01:34:06.465 --> 01:34:06.690
David Boder: Hm.

01:34:06.690 --> 01:34:07.206
Alexander Gertner: We did not permit them to do it.

01:34:07.206 --> 01:34:10.140
David Boder: What did you do about it? Did it happen that someone did eat human flesh?

01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:12.411
Alexander Gertner: It was eaten in several wagons. It was eaten.

01:34:12.411 --> 01:34:12.953
David Boder: Yes.

01:34:12.953 --> 01:34:17.092
Alexander Gertner: And then...and so we see that we are dying out.

01:34:17.092 --> 01:34:18.490
David Boder: What do you mean by Greeks? Greek Jews?

01:34:18.490 --> 01:34:21.273
Alexander Gertner: Greeks, non-Jews. [There were] Jews and gentiles mixed together.

01:34:21.273 --> 01:34:21.544
David Boder: Yes.

01:34:21.544 --> 01:34:26.014
Alexander Gertner: Greeks, they were very terrible, those Greeks. And then...

01:34:26.014 --> 01:34:26.749
David Boder: Wait a moment. [Adjusts the instrument].

01:34:26.749 --> 01:34:27.183
Alexander Gertner: Yes.

01:34:27.183 --> 01:34:28.310
David Boder: Hm.

01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:49.497
Alexander Gertner: And so for six days we are traveling. Why did the journey last so long? Because the train did not have the right of way. On every station [siding] it had to wait for days and nights. And here we see the Germans are promenading. We are stationed under a bridge. On top the Germans are promenading with loaves of bread under their arms. We beg for food. ‘Hunger...hunger...’ And they stand with the breads under their arms, and they smile, and they don’t throw a piece of bread. We kept...

01:34:49.497 --> 01:34:50.262
David Boder: You were begging?

01:34:50.262 --> 01:34:53.786
Alexander Gertner: Yes, from them. We kept the mouth open so that it should snow in. And from the blanket...

01:34:53.786 --> 01:34:55.714
David Boder: These were open wagons?

01:34:55.714 --> 01:34:56.600
Alexander Gertner: Open wagons.

01:34:56.600 --> 01:34:56.823
David Boder: Yes.

01:34:56.823 --> 01:35:07.498
Alexander Gertner: And so we...the snow...I was lucky, and maybe because of that I remained alive, because on the way I had found a small...approximately half a liter of wheat. You know what wheat is.

01:35:07.498 --> 01:35:07.751
David Boder: Grain.

01:35:07.751 --> 01:35:08.004
Alexander Gertner: Grain, yes.

01:35:08.004 --> 01:35:08.709
David Boder: Yes.

01:35:08.709 --> 01:35:13.390
Alexander Gertner: And that I hid in my pockets, and every day a little by little. And I hid myself, and I took one or two at a time [?].

01:35:13.390 --> 01:35:15.390
David Boder: So in these six days you weren’t given anything to eat?

01:35:15.390 --> 01:35:21.625
Alexander Gertner: Absolutely no food. I ate the wheat. And this I kept hidden, and every now and then I would take a kernel. I knew that the wheat [?]...

01:35:21.625 --> 01:35:23.384
David Boder: Nobody saw that you had it?

01:35:23.384 --> 01:35:55.064
Alexander Gertner: No, they didn’t see. We bent to the side. Everybody had something, and whoever did not died. For instance, there were capos and block elders also in these same wagons. They had bread. They didn’t want to share with others. They threw the blankets over themselves and ate, and did not give to others. People were dying. And so we traveled six days and nights; we rode. And so we waited on stations and rode. We got off. And so, excuse me, there all of a sudden I notice [?] the shoes. I see the shoes. The feet are swollen like this.

01:35:55.064 --> 01:35:55.739
David Boder: Your feet?

01:35:55.739 --> 01:36:44.077
Alexander Gertner: My feet, everybody’s, all [of us]. What is this? Swollen [so] we can’t take off our shoes. Impossible. And so we get off in Buchenwald. We arrive in Buchenwald, after six days and six nights. So I got off. Out of twelve hundred people, four hundred. That means a hundred [?] per cent, all the eight hundred people, remained dead in the wagons. And the four hundred, these...we were so that any moment they might die. In fives...we supported each other in fives, and we were led into a bath hall. To add to our troubles we were led into a hot shower, and on the frozen feet hot water. They became swollen, blue. Here we could not stand on our feet. We all had feet like this, and blue. And we didn’t know what to do. Everybody keeps crying. He screams, ‘The feet hurt.’ Thanks, for giving us a little black coffee.

01:36:44.077 --> 01:36:45.023
David Boder: Where was that?

01:36:45.023 --> 01:36:45.969
Alexander Gertner: In Buchenwald.

01:36:45.969 --> 01:36:46.945
David Boder: Oh! You are already in Buchenwald.

01:36:46.945 --> 01:36:47.228
Alexander Gertner: Yes.

01:36:47.228 --> 01:36:47.590
David Boder: Nu?

01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:58.656
Alexander Gertner: That means we were given some black coffee, and we were left standing in the bath hall on the cement floor. We did [bowel movements, possibly] there one on top of the other. We didn’t know. On the way everyone...

01:36:58.656 --> 01:36:59.934
David Boder: What does it mean, it was done there?

01:36:59.934 --> 00:00:00.000
Alexander Gertner: The necessary things.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: [Words not clear.]

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Alexander Gertner: [Words not clear.]

00:00:00.000 --> 01:37:02.506
David Boder: [Not clear; they speak simultaneously.]

01:37:02.506 --> 01:37:17.350
Alexander Gertner: Yes. We didn’t know what to do. And so on the next day we were taken. Those who were very terribly...who absolutely could not stand on his feet, who had legs swollen like this, he was put on a cart and taken to the hospital. Me...me they wouldn’t take at all.

01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:18.627
David Boder: What was done with them?

01:37:18.627 --> 01:37:22.332
Alexander Gertner: We were...They were taken to the hospital. First, that was the first good thing.

01:37:22.332 --> 01:37:25.748
David Boder: And the...and that commandant from that...

01:37:25.748 --> 01:37:29.314
Alexander Gertner: He disappeared. He came with us till Buchenwald, and there he disappeared.

01:37:29.314 --> 01:37:29.555
David Boder: Hm.

01:37:29.555 --> 01:37:30.139
Alexander Gertner: Till Buchenwald...

01:37:30.139 --> 01:37:31.085
David Boder: And you don’t know what happened to him?

01:37:31.085 --> 01:37:31.820
Alexander Gertner: No, I don’t know.

01:37:31.820 --> 01:37:32.826
David Boder: Hm.

01:37:32.826 --> 01:37:44.856
Alexander Gertner: And then when we came to Buchen-...to the infirmary...and so they didn’t want me. They said, ‘You can walk.’ One there said, a prisoner, also a capo...there were the camp militia. In Buchenwald there was a camp militia. It was a political lager [there were allegedly a large number of German, gentile communists who had become influential in the run of the camp—DPB.]

01:37:44.856 --> 01:37:45.790
David Boder: Hm.

01:37:45.790 --> 01:37:50.501
Alexander Gertner: And so, ‘You can walk.’ I said, ‘No, I absolutely can’t. Kill me, I can’t.’ I really couldn’t. Legs like this.

01:37:50.501 --> 01:37:52.097
David Boder: Hm.

01:37:52.097 --> 01:38:07.320
Alexander Gertner: And there [words not clear]. I, too, was taken and driven to the infirmary. In the infirmary we were put on such plank-beds. There were three-tiered plank beds, such wide ones with straw spread on [them]. These were like this. These ‘beautiful’ stories you certainly have heard before.

01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:08.838
David Boder: Nu?

01:38:08.838 --> 01:38:42.176
Alexander Gertner: There the SS men and lager
                        commandant saw that the field [battle] is coming closer, very close, so they went away from the lager. The SS lived in barracks near the camp. They went away from the camp, and they went to the city, to Weimar. Weimar was the city. He was in contact...the camp commandant was in telephone contact with the lager elder, also a prisoner. The lager elder was a [word not clear; sound like dog]. So he wanted to be good. Blocks...a day before, on the 10th of April, Americans came in airplanes. They came every day. They dropped bread and a note that tomorrow they were coming. [I saw them drop it.—BW.]

01:38:42.176 --> 01:38:42.749
David Boder: A bread?

01:38:42.749 --> 01:38:47.430
Alexander Gertner: A bread, a white bread was dropped into the lager, and they also dropped a note that tomorrow they are coming.

01:38:47.430 --> 01:38:49.099
David Boder: Nu?

01:38:49.099 --> 01:38:57.213
Alexander Gertner: And here people were being grabbed to go on a transport. People hid themselves in the [word not clear] in various places, wherever one could.

01:38:57.213 --> 01:38:59.002
David Boder: So the Jews were hiding in the latrines.

01:38:59.002 --> 01:39:03.852
Alexander Gertner: Yes, they hid in the latrines, wherever they could, only not to present themselves for transport.

01:39:03.852 --> 01:39:06.906
David Boder: What does it mean, present themselves? Did the others [word not clear]?

01:39:06.906 --> 01:39:11.014
Alexander Gertner: One was hiding wherever one could. It is impossible to relate.

01:39:11.014 --> 01:39:12.731
David Boder: Well. Nu?

01:39:12.731 --> 01:39:24.539
Alexander Gertner: And on...he was in contact, the lager
                        commandant, with the lager elder. He said...It was so. It had been made up that on the 11th in the morning all should leave, every single one, from Buchenwald.

01:39:24.539 --> 01:39:24.822
David Boder: Hm.

01:39:24.822 --> 01:40:12.706
Alexander Gertner: Should leave the lager. So the lager
                        commandant asked the lager elder on the telephone whether he already had everybody...on the 11th in the morning, whether he already had sent away all the prisoners. So he answered, ‘Yes, Herr lager
                        commandant, everything is settled.’ So he relied on him. And in the meanwhile he did not do so. In the meantime...there were air-raids [words not clear]. We see already the tanks are arriving, and so on. And so that was the lucky thing that [due to which] we remained alive, because the camp commandant...[correction] lager elder had told a lie, that we had already been led away, that we are not here any more. And so at two o’clock in the afternoon, Wednesday on the 11th of April, the Americans have...I was then in the infirmary. We in the infirmary were very frightened. We were saying, ‘Oy, oy, we are being taken away. Oy, oy, we are being taken away.’ One said, ‘I am not going. Let them shoot me here.’ Another said, ‘I am going.’ We...

01:40:12.706 --> 01:40:13.128
David Boder: Hm.

01:40:13.128 --> 01:40:18.351
Alexander Gertner: We were in fear day and night [that] they are taking us away. And here we see...we hear shooting. Day and night we...

01:40:18.351 --> 01:40:19.857
David Boder: Whom? And who was shooting?

01:40:19.857 --> 01:40:20.923
Alexander Gertner: The Americans who were arriving.

01:40:20.923 --> 01:40:22.128
David Boder: Hm. Nu?

01:40:22.128 --> 01:40:46.317
Alexander Gertner: And so they arrived. And then...I couldn’t stand on my feet, but with much joy [?]...I wanted to see what is going on. So I walked over to the window. With two canes under my arms I walked over to the window to see what is going on there. One can’t see anything, only smoke near, around the lager. And the guards are running away, the guards who were around the lager in the towers. [The following section appears in places practically incoherent. This is due to his emotional state, and to imperfections in the equipment.]

01:40:46.317 --> 01:40:46.992
David Boder: SS men?

01:40:46.992 --> 01:41:19.877
Alexander Gertner: The SS. They surrendered. They stood there shooting at one another [?]. Here we see they are already running away, everybody. They have run away. And here are arriving...we already see tanks arriving, tanks shooting fire. We see fire, just fire, and here we see the SS running. They are running away, one after the other. And here we already see a white flag in the lager. And already they shout, ‘It is liberated [the camp].’ There are no Americans yet. All at once when the sentries had left...there were many Russians in camp. These...

01:41:19.877 --> 01:41:20.359
David Boder: Russians?

01:41:20.359 --> 01:41:22.660
Alexander Gertner: Russians, yes, prison-...also prisoners.

01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:23.022
David Boder: Hm.

01:41:23.022 --> 01:41:47.715
Alexander Gertner: They went and caught any SS man they could. They caught, and they took away from them their guns. All of a sudden in comes to us, to the hospital a Russian with a gun on his shoulder. We jump on him, everybody. We kiss him. And he is armed. We did not know yet that we were liberated. An hour later in comes an American. Of course [?], we...we...we cried. Everybody cried for joy. We didn’t know what...we couldn’t believe ourselves that we are liberated.

01:41:47.715 --> 01:41:48.540
David Boder: Yes [?].

01:41:48.540 --> 01:42:04.486
Alexander Gertner: Yes. We didn’t know. We couldn’t believe it. Here we see...we see SS men were brought in. The Russians were searching in the camp and around the camp. They caught yet approximately something like thirty, fourty SS. They brought them into the lager. They pummelled and beat them. They put them into the bunker.

01:42:04.486 --> 01:42:05.070
David Boder: The SS [?]?

01:42:05.070 --> 01:42:06.739
Alexander Gertner: Yes. Into the bunker, and so...

01:42:06.739 --> 01:42:07.173
David Boder: Arrested.

01:42:07.173 --> 01:42:18.390
Alexander Gertner: Yes, arrested. And so on the 11th of April at two o’clock in the afternoon we were liberated. Then the Americans...we already saw tanks. The Americans did a very smart thing. That was our luck. They first liberated the lager and then Weimar.

01:42:18.390 --> 01:42:18.896
David Boder: Hm.

01:42:18.896 --> 01:42:23.637
Alexander Gertner: In proper order they should have first liberated Weimar. Weimar is ahead of Buchenwald, and then [comes] Buchenwald.

01:42:23.637 --> 01:42:32.312
Alexander Gertner: But they knew already from other lagers. They had made a mistake with another lager. They knew that when they liberated the town first, the lager...the lager was in the meantime shot [the prisoners were killed].

01:42:32.312 --> 01:42:32.565
David Boder: Hm.

01:42:32.565 --> 01:42:37.547
Alexander Gertner: So here they proceeded like this. Buchenwald first. First they liberated Buchenwald and then Weimar.

01:42:37.547 --> 01:42:38.053
David Boder: And then Weimar?

01:42:38.053 --> 01:42:39.300
Alexander Gertner: They made a little detour.

01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:40.167
David Boder: Hm.

01:42:40.167 --> 01:42:50.654
Alexander Gertner: That is how we remained alive, twenty-two thousand people. And all of a sudden we see the...the radios began in the lager. In Buchenwald was such a loudspeaker so that it could be heard in the entire lager.

01:42:50.654 --> 01:42:51.625
David Boder: Yes.

01:42:51.625 --> 01:43:31.994
Alexander Gertner: There was also one located in every block. A Czech was there at that time. He took over the lager. And he called out in Czech and in all languages that we are liberated. We shouldn’t worry about anything. Everything possible will be done. And then, around the late afternoon, we didn’t know yet that we are liberated. We couldn’t believe ourselves. When the Americans entered they saw people, dead lying around. Hungry, screaming, we hadn’t eaten for a few days. Because before the liberation for three days we didn’t get any food. Because they didn’t give any bread, nothing. And so when they entered, the Americans didn’t know what to do. They gave orders to cook at once a pork soup, a fat soup.

01:43:31.994 --> 01:43:32.838
David Boder: Nu, and then [?]?

01:43:32.838 --> 01:43:33.181
Alexander Gertner: Yes.

01:43:33.181 --> 01:43:34.718
David Boder: Where did they get them.

01:43:34.718 --> 01:43:37.832
Alexander Gertner: There were in the lager prepared pigs for...to be cooked later on.

01:43:37.832 --> 01:43:38.555
David Boder: Later on, yes.

01:43:38.555 --> 01:43:56.609
Alexander Gertner: For the SS. A fat soup was cooked, and from that a lot of people died, because they were starved. One had not eaten for a few days, and when a very fat soup was cooked, and we threw ourselves over it—we were hungry—so many got diarrhea, and a cloud [multitude] of people perished, by the hundreds [?]. When they saw it...there had arrived officers...

01:43:56.609 --> 01:43:58.790
David Boder: For the occupation [?] of Buchenwald [?]?

01:43:58.790 --> 01:44:13.170
Alexander Gertner: Yes. And so they saw. It was very bad. People are dying already after the liberation. They quickly ordered carloads with...with blood, because there is such...

01:44:13.170 --> 01:44:13.423
David Boder: Yes.

01:44:13.423 --> 01:44:14.700
Alexander Gertner: ...such plasmas...

01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:15.031
David Boder: Yes?

01:44:15.031 --> 01:44:18.055
Alexander Gertner: ...with blood that is given to...to...to sick...

01:44:18.055 --> 01:44:18.266
David Boder: Yes.

01:44:18.266 --> 01:44:20.890
Alexander Gertner: For instance, a soldier gets a bullet, so he looses a lot of blood.

01:44:20.890 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: Yes.

00:00:00.000 --> 01:44:22.326
Alexander Gertner: He is given immediately such an...

01:44:22.326 --> 01:44:22.537
David Boder: Yes.

01:44:22.537 --> 01:44:22.826
Alexander Gertner: ...injection.

01:44:22.826 --> 01:44:23.609
David Boder: An injection.

01:44:23.609 --> 01:44:28.091
Alexander Gertner: An injection. So several wagons were ordered for us. Everybody was given...I received half a liter.

01:44:28.091 --> 01:44:28.276
David Boder: Yes.

01:44:28.276 --> 01:44:57.992
Alexander Gertner: Plasma. And that brought nearly everybody back to life. We got a little blood. The stomach began to work again. We started to get [word not clear]. We had already some doctors. The Americans behaved right away very well. They gave chocolate to eat, different things. Temporary beds were put in, because they had such chrome [?] cots...

01:44:57.992 --> 01:44:58.267
David Boder: Yes.

01:44:58.267 --> 01:45:12.165
Alexander Gertner: ...which could be instantly unfolded [?] and folded up [?]. They didn’t have any other kind. And we were taken out from the lager, only the sick from the sick-room, and we were taken in small groups with automobiles. There were the Negroes. They came with the cars, with the...

01:45:12.165 --> 01:45:12.840
David Boder: The black [colored]...

01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:19.509
Alexander Gertner: The black with the cars, and we were brought, four to ten [?] people [at a time], to the lager. Thus it too eight days after the liberation.

01:45:19.509 --> 01:45:22.021
David Boder: Could anybody make himself understood with them?

01:45:22.021 --> 01:45:25.455
Alexander Gertner: There had arrived a rabbi. Then had arrived [somewhat] later...

01:45:25.455 --> 01:45:26.250
David Boder: Which rabbi?

01:45:26.250 --> 01:45:27.617
Alexander Gertner: Rabbi Schechter was there.

01:45:27.617 --> 01:45:27.858
David Boder: Yes.

01:45:27.858 --> 01:45:48.262
Alexander Gertner: It was he who took us to Switzerland. He...he used to hold services. He also had with him assistants. He used to hold services in Buchenwald. He made speeches [sermons]. He told us to hold on. We should...he sent a transport with children, five hundred, to France, and then us. We were the second transport to...to Switzerland. At first yet to...to Belgium, and then we came to Switzerland. And the third one went to Sweden.

01:45:48.262 --> 01:45:49.840
David Boder: Speak in this direction [towards the microphone]. Nu?

01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:56.117
Alexander Gertner: And then after the liberation we were taken into the SS barracks.

01:45:56.117 --> 01:45:56.659
David Boder: Nu?

01:45:56.659 --> 01:46:19.292
Alexander Gertner: In the SS barrack they began to treat us with care. Everyone was given medicine. And there still very many people died. There was a...a girl from my province [?], from my town [?]. She is in Sweden. She, too, was liberated. Her father died three weeks after the liberation. And she asks me what I know about her father. What should I write to her? I wrote her that I don’t know anything. I am a hundred per cent sure that he had died.

01:46:19.292 --> 01:46:20.840
David Boder: He was with you in Buchenwald?

01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:29.828
Alexander Gertner: In Buchenwald. He had been liberated. Three weeks after the liberation he died of typhus. With typhus it was bad [?]. After the liberation in Buchenwald typhus had raged, terribly.

01:46:29.828 --> 01:46:30.382
David Boder: How come?

01:46:30.382 --> 01:46:36.207
Alexander Gertner: Everybody was...from lice, from the filth, and from not eating, from weak blood, there developed a...

01:46:36.207 --> 01:46:39.111
David Boder: What kind of typhus? Intestinal typhus or spotted typhus?

01:46:39.111 --> 01:46:39.906
Alexander Gertner: Spotted typhus.

01:46:39.906 --> 01:46:40.328
David Boder: Hm.

01:46:40.328 --> 01:46:46.997
Alexander Gertner: Spotted typhus, spotted typhus. And so you think that I didn’t have typhus? I was very thin. I weighed forty-eight kilos [about 106 pounds]. Before the war I weighed...

01:46:46.997 --> 01:46:48.636
David Boder: How much do you weigh now?

01:46:48.636 --> 01:47:17.981
Alexander Gertner: Now I weigh about seventy-two [159 pounds], seventy-three [161 pounds]. Forty-eight I weighed in the lager, imagine! A meter...a meter, seventy-five [centimeters] in height! Then I didn’t think that I was going to survive. Already after the liberation I couldn’t eat. I also had diarrhea. But slowly, after receiving the injection, the plasma, I slowly started eating, and we were...I was till...till...till the end of May I was in the infirmary. That means April, May, two months, already after the liberation...

01:47:17.981 --> 01:47:18.192
David Boder: Nu?

01:47:18.192 --> 01:47:24.891
Alexander Gertner: ...I spent in the infirmary. I couldn’t stand on my feet. Slowly I started to walk. We were [words not clear]...

01:47:24.891 --> 01:47:26.620
David Boder: Hm.

01:47:26.620 --> 01:47:50.186
Alexander Gertner: And so we were...later Rabbi Schecter began to make efforts, working to take us away. And then came the UNRRA. The UNRRA registered us, and everyone was questioned what trade...only up to seventeen were taken. Then came the Sister Kassel from Switzerland. They saw that there were no children. She looked for children up to sixteen. So she took us—a little older ones she also took. We were told all of us went [?].

01:47:50.186 --> 01:47:51.090
David Boder: Sister who?

01:47:51.090 --> 01:47:52.337
Alexander Gertner: Sister Kassel from Switzerland.

01:47:52.337 --> 01:47:52.831
David Boder: From [?]...

01:47:52.831 --> 01:47:53.536
Alexander Gertner: From the Red Cross.

01:47:53.536 --> 01:47:54.542
David Boder: Yes?

01:47:54.542 --> 01:48:05.428
Alexander Gertner: We were...a transport was made up. Three hundred people were told to come. There came four hundred and fifty. We must thank Rabbi Schecter for saving us, so that nobody should remain in Buchenwald.

01:48:05.428 --> 01:48:05.428
David Boder: Yes?

01:48:05.428 --> 01:48:13.061
Alexander Gertner: And then all the others, the other hundred and fifty above the three hundred, these were sent to France. They already are all in Palestine. [This, of course, is not entirely correct. By 1946 many of them were still in the shelterhouses of France.—DPB.]

01:48:13.061 --> 01:48:13.706
David Boder: Hm.

01:48:13.706 --> 01:48:15.947
Alexander Gertner: Because it was not possible [for them] to enter Switzerland.

01:48:15.947 --> 01:48:16.983
David Boder: And?

01:48:16.983 --> 01:48:24.724
Alexander Gertner: And they made different inspections [?]. We were looked over fifty times to Switzerland.

01:48:24.724 --> 01:48:25.399
David Boder: What do you mean by looked over?

01:48:25.399 --> 01:48:29.447
Alexander Gertner: Looked over...[defect of wire]...I did look much older...

01:48:29.447 --> 01:48:29.700
David Boder: Hm.

01:48:29.700 --> 01:48:37.471
Alexander Gertner: ...but not too old. I had hair...[correction] at that time I had absolutely no hair. I looked like after typhus...

01:48:37.471 --> 01:48:37.935
David Boder: Nu?

01:48:37.935 --> 01:48:45.296
Alexander Gertner: ...and very weak. So he says to the doctor—that was an American doctor—he said, ‘That boy must have a rest [convalesce].’

01:48:45.296 --> 01:48:45.869
David Boder: Yes.

01:48:45.869 --> 01:48:53.200
Alexander Gertner: And he said...he signed [a permit] that I can go. That is how we came to Switzerland, [word not clear].

01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:55.652
David Boder: And what are you doing now?

01:48:55.652 --> 01:49:03.345
Alexander Gertner: Now. I have been in Switzerland. I was in a quarantine camp [words not clear] four weeks, and there we also suffered hunger for a short time.

01:49:03.345 --> 01:49:04.050
David Boder: In the quarantine camp?

01:49:04.050 --> 01:49:15.809
Alexander Gertner: Yes. We came to stealing a potatoe. We didn’t have anything to eat. And then we came...we were...the Jewish Community took us over. We were taken to a Hachshara. You know, of course, what Hachshara.is? Preparation for Palestine. Hachshara...

01:49:15.809 --> 01:49:16.381
David Boder: Yes.

01:49:16.381 --> 01:49:22.779
Alexander Gertner: And everybody was assigned, those who wanted to go to Palestine. I was eight months in the Hachshara [words not clear]. Hapoel Hamizrachi [religious farmers]...

01:49:22.779 --> 01:49:23.243
David Boder: Nu?

01:49:23.243 --> 01:49:38.255
Alexander Gertner: In the fall [?] and winter [?]. And then when I saw it goes too slow with the certificates [a travel permit to Palestine], when I saw that the prospects are doubtful for going to Palestine, it may take a long time yet, so I thought first to learn a trade and then decide where to go.

01:49:38.255 --> 01:49:40.616
David Boder: Hm. And where do you learn the trade?

01:49:40.616 --> 01:49:41.743
Alexander Gertner: Now I am learning at the...

01:49:41.743 --> 01:49:42.478
David Boder: At the ORT?

01:49:42.478 --> 01:49:47.580
Alexander Gertner: Now, I started im March to learn cabinet making [furniture carpentry].

01:49:47.580 --> 01:49:49.900
David Boder: You have here good teachers [?]?

01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:50.695
Alexander Gertner: Yes.

01:49:50.695 --> 01:49:59.039
David Boder: Hm. Nu, Gertner, I thank you very much. The report makes [?] a good spool.

01:49:59.039 --> 01:50:03.720
Alexander Gertner: I must thank you, but I hope you will use them for a good purpose.

01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:06.804
David Boder: Well, to the best of our ability.

01:50:06.804 --> 01:50:07.075
Alexander Gertner: Yes.

01:50:07.075 --> 01:50:19.527
David Boder: And if I should not make full use of it, someone else who can do it better will. We will preserve the spools. And as long as they will be preserved, others will be able to use them.

01:50:19.527 --> 01:50:20.744
Alexander Gertner: I would like a few more words...

01:50:20.744 --> 01:50:21.328
David Boder: Yes.

01:50:21.328 --> 01:50:23.949
Alexander Gertner: My Jewish name is Sholom...

01:50:23.949 --> 01:50:24.292
David Boder: Yes.

01:50:24.292 --> 01:50:27.798
Alexander Gertner: And my mother was nee...because at home I was...in case there are some relatives.

01:50:27.798 --> 01:50:28.126
David Boder: Yes.

01:50:28.126 --> 01:50:32.204
Alexander Gertner: My mother was nee Gonz, well, Gonz. Sholom I was called at home.

01:50:32.204 --> 01:50:32.807
David Boder: Gonz?

01:50:32.807 --> 01:50:33.482
Alexander Gertner: Gonz.

01:50:33.482 --> 01:50:34.217
David Boder: Your mother’s surname?

01:50:34.217 --> 01:50:36.488
Alexander Gertner: My mother is Gonz, and my...

01:50:36.488 --> 01:50:38.416
David Boder: How is it spelled?

01:50:38.416 --> 01:50:40.687
Alexander Gertner: G-O-N-Z.

01:50:40.687 --> 01:50:41.289
David Boder: Gonz.

01:50:41.289 --> 01:50:41.903
Alexander Gertner: Yes. And [word not clear].

01:50:41.903 --> 01:50:43.752
David Boder: And your father’s name is Gertner?

01:50:43.752 --> 01:50:46.523
Alexander Gertner: Gertner. And so now my name is Gertner, Alexander.

01:50:46.523 --> 01:50:50.710
David Boder: Your parent always lived in Transylvania [?]?

01:50:50.710 --> 01:50:51.403
Alexander Gertner: Yes.

01:50:51.403 --> 01:50:52.096
David Boder: Hm.

01:50:52.096 --> 01:50:56.476
Alexander Gertner: Yes. The mother had come [had perished?]....I hoped that the sister is alive, but I don’t know...

01:50:56.476 --> 01:50:56.970
David Boder: You don’t know.

01:50:56.970 --> 01:51:00.837
Alexander Gertner: ...what happened to her. I don’t have any relatives.

01:51:00.837 --> 01:51:02.084
David Boder: You don’t have any relatives?

01:51:02.084 --> 01:51:02.698
Alexander Gertner: No relatives.

01:51:02.698 --> 01:51:35.327
David Boder: Hm. [In English] This concludes Spool 79...concludes Spool 79 taken by [from] Mr. Gertner at the home for displaced Jews, of a religious nature, in Geneva in March...[correction] in August 26, 1946. An Illinois Institute of Technology recording. And so thank you very much.

01:51:35.327 --> 01:51:38.240
Alexander Gertner: Thank you [?].
