00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:40.613
David Boder: [In English] Paris, August the 22nd 1946, at the headquarters of the Joint, American Joint Distribution Committee. The interviewee is Miss Irena Rosenwasser. Also...and she prefers to speak German although her English is...seems to be rather satisfactory.

00:00:40.613 --> 00:00:45.402
David Boder: [In German] Now then Miss Rosenwasser, will you tell us where you are from?

00:00:45.402 --> 00:00:46.573
Irena Rosenwasser: From Hungary

00:00:46.573 --> 00:00:53.390
David Boder: You are from Hungary. You were telling me that you wanted to go to America and that you belong to the Hungarian quota. Is that so?

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.870
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.936
David Boder: And you have an uncle in Los Angeles; and what is his name?

00:00:56.936 --> 00:00:58.112
Irena Rosenwasser: Rabbi Goldberger.

00:00:58.112 --> 00:01:09.884
David Boder: But you must talk straight. When you turn your head [with a chuckle]...we don’t have television yet, is that not so? He is the Rabbi, Dr. Goldberger, is that so?

00:01:09.884 --> 00:01:10.378
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes.

00:01:10.378 --> 00:01:21.736
David Boder: Now then, Miss Rosenwasser, will you please tell me where you were when the war started—where did the war reach you? Speak louder.

00:01:21.736 --> 00:01:26.263
Irena Rosenwasser: And so, I was home until the year ’44.

00:01:26.263 --> 00:01:27.671
David Boder: Where is that ‘home’?

00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:31.322
Irena Rosenwasser: In Hungary, in Kisvarda...

00:01:31.322 --> 00:01:32.171
David Boder: Yes...

00:01:32.171 --> 00:01:35.396
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . with my parents, with my whole family.

00:01:35.396 --> 00:01:39.034
David Boder: Will you please tell me how many people there were in your family?

00:01:39.034 --> 00:01:40.692
Irena Rosenwasser: Six children...

00:01:40.692 --> 00:01:41.011
David Boder: Yes, you father...

00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:41.975
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . and the parents.

00:01:41.975 --> 00:01:43.408
David Boder: You father and your mother...

00:01:43.408 --> 00:01:44.020
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.824
David Boder: . . . and six children.

00:01:45.824 --> 00:01:46.690
Irena Rosenwasser: Six children.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.790
David Boder: And which child were you? The oldest or which...?

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.150
Irena Rosenwasser: My brother is the oldest. I follow afterwards.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.196
David Boder: Yes. And then the other children. How old...

00:01:55.196 --> 00:01:56.903
Irena Rosenwasser: They were smaller.

00:01:56.903 --> 00:01:58.876
David Boder: What do you mean, ‘they were’...?

00:01:58.876 --> 00:02:03.475
Irena Rosenwasser: Now, one was eight years old, ten years, seventeen, and twenty years [old].

00:02:03.475 --> 00:02:05.987
David Boder: Yes...And you were then already over twenty.

00:02:05.987 --> 00:02:06.514
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes.

00:02:06.514 --> 00:02:14.434
David Boder: Yes...Now, you lived in Hungary; and tell me what happened there when the war started.

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:23.175
Irena Rosenwasser: When the war started it was, in general, not bad for the Jews.

00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:23.828
David Boder: Yes...

00:02:23.828 --> 00:02:35.525
Irena Rosenwasser: Only when the Germans had come in, in ’44, the Jews were concentrated in various ghettos, and from the ghettos they were shipped away.

00:02:35.525 --> 00:02:47.109
David Boder: Now will you tell me what happened to you personally, in you city—what you, yourself, have seen and experienced. Also, how did that start?

00:02:47.109 --> 00:03:08.445
Irena Rosenwasser: The Jews could not leave their homes. The names of all Jews were registered, a list was made of the children, of the business, of the property. And the Jews had to give up everything, and they could take to the ghetto only about fifty kilos.

00:03:08.445 --> 00:03:13.861
David Boder: Aha...Now how did that happen? How was that announced, that they must go to the ghetto?

00:03:13.861 --> 00:03:16.888
Irena Rosenwasser: The gendarmerie have announced that.

00:03:16.888 --> 00:03:19.838
David Boder: Yes. And do you remember about what month it was?

00:03:19.838 --> 00:03:23.040
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes, it was in May, ’44; in May.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.226
David Boder: Also what did they say? You must...?

00:03:26.226 --> 00:03:30.102
Irena Rosenwasser: Already before there were always [?] ‘Jewish Laws’, against the Jews.

00:03:30.102 --> 00:03:30.274
David Boder: Yes...

00:03:30.274 --> 00:03:32.983
Irena Rosenwasser: Already everything was taken over.

00:03:32.983 --> 00:03:33.493
David Boder: Yes...

00:03:33.493 --> 00:03:36.578
Irena Rosenwasser: The business, for instance, the fields and...

00:03:36.578 --> 00:03:40.084
David Boder: Yes, what was the business of your parents?

00:03:40.084 --> 00:03:41.346
Irena Rosenwasser: Dresses.

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:43.291
David Boder: Aha...They had a dress business.

00:03:43.291 --> 00:03:43.598
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes...

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:45.555
David Boder: So how was the business taken away? What did they...

00:03:45.555 --> 00:03:50.909
Irena Rosenwasser: Padlocked. Everything was registered and padlocked—and they took the key.

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:52.817
David Boder: And the things remained in the store?

00:03:52.817 --> 00:03:53.476
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes.

00:03:53.476 --> 00:03:56.294
David Boder: Yes...And do you know what happened afterwards to it?

00:03:56.294 --> 00:04:00.006
Irena Rosenwasser: That I don’t know. I think they have...the Germans have taken everything.

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:06.430
David Boder: Aha...Now they simply padlocked you business. Did they demand the money?

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.012
Irena Rosenwasser: Everything, yes! The cash box, the full cashier box, and the merchandise.

00:04:10.012 --> 00:04:14.541
David Boder: Aha...And all that they have taken away. And then what did they tell you to do?

00:04:14.541 --> 00:04:17.881
Irena Rosenwasser: That we should remain in the homes...the homes.

00:04:17.881 --> 00:04:18.079
David Boder: Yes...

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:24.294
Irena Rosenwasser: And there were daily two or three hours free [open], when we could get something, provisions,...

00:04:24.294 --> 00:04:24.707
David Boder: Yes...

00:04:24.707 --> 00:04:34.376
Irena Rosenwasser: And then, after a week, they told us that we would all be concentrated. a few buildings were...

00:04:34.376 --> 00:04:34.812
David Boder: . . . assigned?

00:04:34.812 --> 00:04:39.620
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . assigned. And so we came on a cart [carriage?] to the ghetto.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.098
David Boder: What was the name of the city where you lived, again?

00:04:42.098 --> 00:04:43.363
Irena Rosenwasser: Kisvarda.

00:04:43.363 --> 00:04:45.408
David Boder: How many people lived there altogether?

00:04:45.408 --> 00:04:46.730
Irena Rosenwasser: Sixteen thousand.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:47.358
David Boder: Altogether?

00:04:47.358 --> 00:04:47.815
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes.

00:04:47.815 --> 00:04:49.608
David Boder: And how many Jews were there, approximately?

00:04:49.608 --> 00:04:59.310
Irena Rosenwasser: Jews, there were two thousand, but the whole environs were concentrated in Kisvarda. That is, we had there in the ghetto about six thousand Jews.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.451
David Boder: Aha...That is, they have also [brought in] the Jews from the environs?

00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:04.757
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes. That was a concentration point, Kisvarda.

00:05:04.757 --> 00:05:09.069
David Boder: Yes. And then, how did they get up the ghetto? How was that set up?

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:16.836
Irena Rosenwasser: Two streets were designated for this [purpose], with large buildings. Everything was vacated, the Christians had to go away...

00:05:16.836 --> 00:05:17.497
David Boder: Yes...

00:05:17.497 --> 00:05:24.623
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . and we got that. In one room we were approximately twelve to twenty people.

00:05:24.623 --> 00:05:25.852
David Boder: Yes...In one room!

00:05:25.852 --> 00:05:28.690
Irena Rosenwasser: In one room. Yes...Children with men and women together.

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:29.363
David Boder: Now, how did they sleep there?

00:05:29.363 --> 00:05:30.724
Irena Rosenwasser: They were lying on the floor...

00:05:30.724 --> 00:05:30.860
David Boder: Yes...

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:39.235
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . no beds, no furniture of any kind was there—no chair, nothing. It was strictly prohibited.

00:05:39.235 --> 00:05:39.647
David Boder: Aha...

00:05:39.647 --> 00:05:42.317
Irena Rosenwasser: And we made [we cooked] kitchen...

00:05:42.317 --> 00:05:42.489
David Boder: Where?

00:05:42.489 --> 00:05:46.768
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . in the hotel. Well, there was a place...

00:05:46.768 --> 00:05:47.321
David Boder: Yes...

00:05:47.321 --> 00:05:48.261
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . a school yard...

00:05:48.261 --> 00:05:48.418
David Boder: Yes...

00:05:48.418 --> 00:05:49.214
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . There they, they built...

00:05:49.214 --> 00:05:49.479
David Boder: [word not clear, sounds like ‘streets’]

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:57.866
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . a large, large kitchens, the Jews [built them]...

00:05:57.866 --> 00:06:33.454
David Boder: [In English] There is a break in the spool which has to be fixed after rewinding. [Pause] [In German] Now then, Miss Rosenwasser, we were talking about the order that you had to go to the ghetto. You were twelve or ten people in one room, men, women and children, and your property was taken away, and you say that the money was taken away. What else did you have to surrender? You said something about jewelry. Now...

00:06:33.454 --> 00:06:43.835
Irena Rosenwasser: About jewelry...All things of value we had to surrender, only foodstuff and a few pieces of clothing were we permitted to take with us. Then...

00:06:43.835 --> 00:06:46.673
David Boder: Have you hidden any of your money?

00:06:46.673 --> 00:06:57.036
Irena Rosenwasser: No, we have hidden nothing. Daily the police came and led away the Jews and beat them horribly.

00:06:57.036 --> 00:06:58.490
David Boder: Already in the ghetto, from the ghetto?

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:05.904
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes, from the ghetto where they have hidden their money and their wealth. A few they even killed.

00:07:05.904 --> 00:07:09.561
David Boder: Yes. Did something of the kind happen to your family?

00:07:09.561 --> 00:07:10.585
Irena Rosenwasser: No.

00:07:10.585 --> 00:07:14.225
David Boder: Why? Did they believe you that you had surrendered everything?

00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:16.595
Irena Rosenwasser: Because we were not such rich people.

00:07:16.595 --> 00:07:24.634
David Boder: Oh, you were not rich people from the start. And so...now what happened afterwards?

00:07:24.634 --> 00:07:24.854
Irena Rosenwasser: We were...

00:07:24.854 --> 00:07:28.605
David Boder: What were people doing in the ghetto in order to live?

00:07:28.605 --> 00:07:37.112
Irena Rosenwasser: Nothing at all. We only organized [the] Jews to do what we could. There were a few physicians...

00:07:37.112 --> 00:07:37.341
David Boder: Yes...

00:07:37.341 --> 00:07:43.962
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . and...police, Jewish police, but from outside there came no help.

00:07:43.962 --> 00:07:44.467
David Boder: Yes...

00:07:44.467 --> 00:07:52.133
Irena Rosenwasser: Nothing at all. The Wehrmacht [German regular army of occupation] was in the city, the German Wehrmacht and a few SS men.

00:07:52.133 --> 00:07:54.675
David Boder: Aha...Now and so...

00:07:54.675 --> 00:08:24.295
Irena Rosenwasser: We figured that we remain here. But at the end of the month there came the notice that we must leave the ghetto. In two transports we were led out to the railroad station. There everything was again inspected and everything was taken away [a chuckle], and afterwards we were crowded in, seventy-seven people, in one cattle car.

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:28.143
David Boder: Why do you call it a cattle car? A freight car? Or was it really a cattle car?

00:08:28.143 --> 00:08:29.645
Irena Rosenwasser: It was for horses.

00:08:29.645 --> 00:08:30.165
David Boder: How did you know?

00:08:30.165 --> 00:08:32.691
Irena Rosenwasser: It was written on it [forty men and eight horses].

00:08:32.691 --> 00:08:33.091
David Boder: Oh, yes.

00:08:33.091 --> 00:08:35.353
Irena Rosenwasser: A German RR-car, it was for...

00:08:35.353 --> 00:08:35.465
David Boder: Forty men?

00:08:35.465 --> 00:08:37.366
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . forty or thirty horses.

00:08:37.366 --> 00:08:37.670
David Boder: Yes...

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:39.180
Irena Rosenwasser: I don’t know so exactly what it was...

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.793
David Boder: Now then?

00:08:40.793 --> 00:08:42.502
Irena Rosenwasser: It [the car] was lead-sealed [with a seal of lead]

00:08:42.502 --> 00:08:44.676
David Boder: Yes. And how many people were you there?

00:08:44.676 --> 00:08:46.469
Irena Rosenwasser: Seventy-seven people.

00:08:46.469 --> 00:08:49.135
David Boder: Who counted that?

00:08:49.135 --> 00:08:56.324
Irena Rosenwasser: Well, the gendarmerie. When we embarked the people were counted, so that nobody be absent...

00:08:56.324 --> 00:08:57.417
David Boder: Aha...And...

00:08:57.417 --> 00:09:00.996
Irena Rosenwasser: There was a large counting place, and the people were counted [one word not clear].

00:09:00.996 --> 00:09:06.279
David Boder: Yes. The Germans called that appell, which means to count the people...

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:06.459
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes.

00:09:06.459 --> 00:09:07.520
David Boder: . . . and call out their numbers, etc.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.136
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes.

00:09:08.136 --> 00:09:14.682
David Boder: Now...and...now then...were you and your whole family together?

00:09:14.682 --> 00:09:21.399
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes. In the RR-car we were still together.

00:09:21.399 --> 00:09:27.080
David Boder: [There is some interruption] In the RR-car you were together...Yes?

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.465
Irena Rosenwasser: Up to Auschwitz.

00:09:28.465 --> 00:09:28.697
David Boder: Yes...

00:09:28.697 --> 00:09:36.688
Irena Rosenwasser: We traveled approximately three days without air, without water, and with two dead...

00:09:36.688 --> 00:09:38.469
David Boder: How come? The dead were not removed?

00:09:38.469 --> 00:09:40.247
Irena Rosenwasser: [In English] No. [Repeats in German] No.

00:09:40.247 --> 00:09:45.235
David Boder: You say without air, without water, Were there no windows in the RR-car?

00:09:45.235 --> 00:09:49.130
Irena Rosenwasser: There were only...there were only a few openings [holes]. But in spite of that...

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:50.383
David Boder: Yes. And...

00:09:50.383 --> 00:09:52.536
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . but they were not open.

00:09:52.536 --> 00:09:54.518
David Boder: Now tell me, was there a toilet?

00:09:54.518 --> 00:09:56.875
Irena Rosenwasser: No, altogether not a single one.

00:09:56.875 --> 00:10:02.134
David Boder: So, how did the people...take care of themselves?

00:10:02.134 --> 00:10:04.417
Irena Rosenwasser: Well, a curtain was made...

00:10:04.417 --> 00:10:06.489
David Boder: They made a curtain...Yes...?

00:10:06.489 --> 00:10:07.096
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes.

00:10:07.096 --> 00:10:11.963
David Boder: Yes. And...when...when was that thrown out?

00:10:11.963 --> 00:10:14.464
Irena Rosenwasser: Only upon arrival.

00:10:14.464 --> 00:10:18.130
David Boder: Only upon arrival. So the air was very bad?

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:22.307
Irena Rosenwasser: Very bad. That is why two had died. Two [of the] more feeble people.

00:10:22.307 --> 00:10:23.841
David Boder: Men or women?

00:10:23.841 --> 00:10:26.401
Irena Rosenwasser: An old man, and a rather young woman.

00:10:26.401 --> 00:10:28.509
David Boder: All right. Now then...

00:10:28.509 --> 00:10:53.363
Irena Rosenwasser: We arrived in Auschwitz about...but the journey was very bad, because constantly the SS would enter, they opened the RR-cars...with arms [in hand] and demand sliver [?] watch...

00:10:53.363 --> 00:10:53.509
David Boder: watches...?

00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:58.265
Irena Rosenwasser: Watches, and toiletries, and money, jewelry...

00:10:58.265 --> 00:10:58.661
David Boder: Yes.

00:10:58.661 --> 00:11:00.603
Irena Rosenwasser: And so they looted again.

00:11:00.603 --> 00:11:01.510
David Boder: Yes...

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:06.044
Irena Rosenwasser: Then we arrived at about twelve o’clock at night in Auschwitz.

00:11:06.044 --> 00:11:08.045
David Boder: Now, how many days did you travel?

00:11:08.045 --> 00:11:10.661
Irena Rosenwasser: About two and a half, three days.

00:11:10.661 --> 00:11:12.936
David Boder: Yes, and then you arrived in Auschwitz...

00:11:12.936 --> 00:11:14.925
Irena Rosenwasser: It was on a Friday night...

00:11:14.925 --> 00:11:15.234
David Boder: Yes...

00:11:15.234 --> 00:11:28.334
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . We arrived at the rr-station of Auschwitz. We had to wait two to three hours, and afterwards they opened the RR-car and we disembarked

00:11:28.334 --> 00:11:28.706
David Boder: Yes...

00:11:28.706 --> 00:11:36.058
Irena Rosenwasser: They told us immediately, we have to leave all the baggage, everything in the RR-car, we shall get it tomorrow.

00:11:36.058 --> 00:11:36.716
David Boder: Yes...

00:11:36.716 --> 00:11:42.498
Irena Rosenwasser: Then they started the ‘selection’. We, of course, did not know what that meant.

00:11:42.498 --> 00:11:43.378
David Boder: Yes...

00:11:43.378 --> 00:11:50.349
Irena Rosenwasser: My mother, with two siblings, were assigned to the right side...

00:11:50.349 --> 00:11:51.613
David Boder: Were those sisters or brother...?

00:11:51.613 --> 00:11:52.009
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes...

00:11:52.009 --> 00:11:52.881
David Boder: Two sisters?

00:11:52.881 --> 00:11:53.562
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes...

00:11:53.562 --> 00:11:53.646
David Boder: Yes...

00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:54.815
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . and I...

00:11:54.815 --> 00:11:56.448
David Boder: How old were the girls?

00:11:56.448 --> 00:11:58.128
Irena Rosenwasser: Eight and ten years old.

00:11:58.128 --> 00:12:00.046
David Boder: Yes, the mother with the two children.

00:12:00.046 --> 00:12:02.368
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes. My mother was forty-eight years old.

00:12:02.368 --> 00:12:03.664
David Boder: Yes, and...

00:12:03.664 --> 00:12:07.136
Irena Rosenwasser: And my brothers again by themselves, separately...the men were immediately...

00:12:07.136 --> 00:12:08.563
David Boder: And your father?

00:12:08.563 --> 00:12:09.807
Irena Rosenwasser: The father too...

00:12:09.807 --> 00:12:10.465
David Boder: With the brothers?

00:12:10.465 --> 00:12:21.032
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes...again...because I was...You see, the younger people were again gathered separately.

00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:21.642
David Boder: Yes...and?

00:12:21.642 --> 00:12:23.750
Irena Rosenwasser: [She weeps]...and I have never seen them again.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:25.427
David Boder: Whom have you never seen again [the question arose from the ambiguous meaning of the pronoun sie/?

00:12:25.427 --> 00:12:27.285
Irena Rosenwasser: None of my family.

00:12:27.285 --> 00:12:28.926
David Boder: Your brothers, neither?

00:12:28.926 --> 00:12:34.815
Irena Rosenwasser: No...Nobody. [Pause] My brother...one of them...you see, we were six children.

00:12:34.815 --> 00:12:34.983
David Boder: Yes...

00:12:34.983 --> 00:12:37.315
Irena Rosenwasser: One brother did not come with us.

00:12:37.315 --> 00:12:38.396
David Boder: Aha...

00:12:38.396 --> 00:12:40.316
Irena Rosenwasser: So this one remained alive.

00:12:40.316 --> 00:12:41.603
David Boder: How old is he, was he?

00:12:41.603 --> 00:12:46.495
Irena Rosenwasser: Twenty-six years [old]. He is now twenty-eight years old.

00:12:46.495 --> 00:12:47.719
David Boder: Was he married?

00:12:47.719 --> 00:12:48.452
Irena Rosenwasser: no.

00:12:48.452 --> 00:12:50.230
David Boder: And how come he remained behind?

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:55.491
Irena Rosenwasser: You see, he by himself, escaped from the ghetto.

00:12:55.491 --> 00:12:56.493
David Boder: He ran away?

00:12:56.493 --> 00:13:04.334
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes...ran away. They looked for him everywhere. He hid himself, and afterwards with trouble and pain he reached Budapest...

00:13:04.334 --> 00:13:04.540
David Boder: Yes...

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:08.803
Irena Rosenwasser: And from Budapest he was ‘carried’ out to Belgium.

00:13:08.803 --> 00:13:09.025
David Boder: Sent...?

00:13:09.025 --> 00:13:19.668
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes, sent, and from Belgium—there he was liberated. He came to Switzerland, and from Switzerland to Palestine. Since then [a few words not clear] he lives in Palestine.

00:13:19.668 --> 00:13:21.790
David Boder: Did he come to Palestine illegally?

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:22.845
Irena Rosenwasser: No, legally.

00:13:22.845 --> 00:13:23.586
David Boder: He got a...[permit]?

00:13:23.586 --> 00:13:25.060
Irena Rosenwasser: With the last transport.

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.353
David Boder: Aha...Now...and the...

00:13:27.353 --> 00:13:28.345
Irena Rosenwasser: The others...

00:13:28.345 --> 00:13:28.486
David Boder: Yes...

00:13:28.486 --> 00:13:29.212
Irena Rosenwasser: The...two younger ones...

00:13:29.212 --> 00:13:31.191
David Boder: Have you seen him in Belgium?

00:13:31.191 --> 00:13:32.774
Irena Rosenwasser: No, I have not seen him.

00:13:32.774 --> 00:13:33.656
David Boder: Have you seen him since the start of the war?

00:13:33.656 --> 00:13:35.051
Irena Rosenwasser: I have not seen him at all.

00:13:35.051 --> 00:13:37.501
David Boder: Yes. And the two younger ones?

00:13:37.501 --> 00:13:44.731
Irena Rosenwasser: I heard about them. They were in Auschwitz, in another camp, because in Auschwitz there were very many, many lagers...

00:13:44.731 --> 00:13:45.551
David Boder: Yes...

00:13:45.551 --> 00:13:51.700
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . And afterwards they were sent away with a transport, and never were they seen again.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.899
David Boder: And your father and mother?

00:13:53.899 --> 00:14:05.627
Irena Rosenwasser: I heard nothing [from them]. They were unfortunately selected [doomed] right at the rr-station, because close to the station were two crematories. [She apparently weeps again] Immediately the people...they were told, we are...we are going to bathe.

00:14:05.627 --> 00:14:06.290
David Boder: Yes...

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:20.607
Irena Rosenwasser: And I saw the crematory myself, because, when the Russians had approached nearer and nearer, the crematories were destroyed. I have seen them well. There was a sign: ‘to the bathing room!, to disinfection...

00:14:20.607 --> 00:14:20.905
David Boder: Yes...

00:14:20.905 --> 00:14:23.355
Irena Rosenwasser: And so the poor people were driven in, and...

00:14:23.355 --> 00:14:24.520
David Boder: They did not come out. [This was really a remark to help her finish the sentence.]

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.264
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . and they did not come out anymore...Burned!

00:14:26.264 --> 00:14:27.079
David Boder: Now, and what...

00:14:27.079 --> 00:14:35.829
Irena Rosenwasser: And, the children...too. Because Mr. Mengele, the physician of the lager, said he does not want to see any children...

00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:37.146
David Boder: Oh, the physician of the lager...

00:14:37.146 --> 00:14:37.401
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes.

00:14:37.401 --> 00:14:38.754
David Boder: . . . said he does not want to see any children, and then?

00:14:38.754 --> 00:14:44.542
Irena Rosenwasser: He does not want to see any children, only workers. This is a work lager and not for children, and not...

00:14:44.542 --> 00:14:45.294
David Boder: The physician?

00:14:45.294 --> 00:14:45.859
Irena Rosenwasser: The physician.

00:14:45.859 --> 00:14:47.259
David Boder: What was his name?

00:14:47.259 --> 00:14:48.173
Irena Rosenwasser: Mengele.

00:14:48.173 --> 00:14:50.497
David Boder: Mengele. Don’t you know what happened to him?

00:14:50.497 --> 00:14:54.760
Irena Rosenwasser: Oh, Yes. I have heard he was captured.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:55.407
David Boder: He was captured.

00:14:55.407 --> 00:14:56.227
Irena Rosenwasser: He was [word not clear, may mean possibly ‘executed’]

00:14:56.227 --> 00:15:01.717
David Boder: Yes...Now then...what happened to you?

00:15:01.717 --> 00:15:03.117
Irena Rosenwasser: Tho whole night I was in the bath...

00:15:03.117 --> 00:15:03.461
David Boder: You said...

00:15:03.461 --> 00:15:03.989
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . At the station.

00:15:03.989 --> 00:15:04.401
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:04.401 --> 00:15:05.722
Irena Rosenwasser: In the bath, and...

00:15:05.722 --> 00:15:09.817
David Boder: You have seen the crematories at the station. Did the chimneys smoke?

00:15:09.817 --> 00:15:21.656
Irena Rosenwasser: They burned. There was a big fire [visible] from afar, and there was an uproar and screaming. We did not know what was going on. Such a smoke, it was horrible. This we are unable to describe.

00:15:21.656 --> 00:15:23.792
David Boder: Did the smoke come from the chimneys?

00:15:23.792 --> 00:15:27.872
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes. And outside there were also big fires, always.

00:15:27.872 --> 00:15:27.986
David Boder: Yes...

00:15:27.986 --> 00:15:32.164
Irena Rosenwasser: That was always seen from the lager, the crematories. They were not far.

00:15:32.164 --> 00:15:32.316
David Boder: Yes...

00:15:32.316 --> 00:15:34.092
Irena Rosenwasser: We saw them day and night.

00:15:34.092 --> 00:15:34.368
David Boder: What? The...the...

00:15:34.368 --> 00:15:35.752
Irena Rosenwasser: It was always burning.

00:15:35.752 --> 00:15:37.909
David Boder: And what fires were outside the crematories?

00:15:37.909 --> 00:15:41.048
Irena Rosenwasser: There were outside large...because they were insufficient...

00:15:41.048 --> 00:15:41.200
David Boder: Yes...

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:55.268
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . Only about a thousand people could be burned at one time. So they made large ditches outside. The people were first gassed [gas-killed], then placed in these ditches and set to fire with petroleum, something like that.

00:15:55.268 --> 00:15:56.652
David Boder: Yes...

00:15:56.652 --> 00:15:57.879
Irena Rosenwasser: But it was burning outside [in the open].

00:15:57.879 --> 00:15:59.901
David Boder: And the smoke was visible?

00:15:59.901 --> 00:16:07.353
Irena Rosenwasser: Oh, always. And it was a very, very large fire. It was as high as the heavens. Incessantly transports were...

00:16:07.353 --> 00:16:11.656
David Boder: Well, So the prisoners knew what was going on there?

00:16:11.656 --> 00:16:12.531
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes.

00:16:12.531 --> 00:16:15.235
David Boder: Yes. Now then...what did you say about transports arriving...?

00:16:15.235 --> 00:16:24.456
Irena Rosenwasser: Transports continued arriving from Hungary, more and more; because in Hungary there were one million Jews. And everybody outside of Budapest...

00:16:24.456 --> 00:16:24.611
David Boder: Yes...

00:16:24.611 --> 00:16:28.991
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . was sent to concentration camps, and mainly to Auschwitz.

00:16:28.991 --> 00:16:30.620
David Boder: Outside of Budapest. And in Budapest, where were they taken?

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:37.654
Irena Rosenwasser: In Budapest, too, very many people were caught on the streets, but a few saved themselves in spite of that.

00:16:37.654 --> 00:16:40.824
David Boder: Yes. And among them was also your brother.

00:16:40.824 --> 00:16:42.054
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes...my brother.

00:16:42.054 --> 00:16:45.111
David Boder: When did you hear for the first time from your brother?

00:16:45.111 --> 00:16:56.284
Irena Rosenwasser: I received a letter from England, from a woman who was married in England. And she communicated with me [about him]. I was in Bergen-Belsen after liberation.

00:16:56.284 --> 00:16:56.796
David Boder: Aha...

00:16:56.796 --> 00:16:58.844
Irena Rosenwasser: It was a great joy for me.

00:16:58.844 --> 00:16:59.946
David Boder: Did you see him?

00:16:59.946 --> 00:17:00.505
Irena Rosenwasser: No.

00:17:00.505 --> 00:17:02.542
David Boder: Aha...Now then...

00:17:02.542 --> 00:17:06.581
Irena Rosenwasser: And so we spent the whole night in the bath.

00:17:06.581 --> 00:17:07.237
David Boder: In the bath?

00:17:07.237 --> 00:17:20.639
Irena Rosenwasser: In the bath. Also, first they cut our hair. And all, all pieces of clothing were taken away, and without socks. We were given a shirt, a bad dress, wooden shoes...

00:17:20.639 --> 00:17:21.094
David Boder: Yes...

00:17:21.094 --> 00:17:26.467
Irena Rosenwasser: It was very cold, the place in is Polonia, in Poland...

00:17:26.467 --> 00:17:27.092
David Boder: In Poland, yes...

00:17:27.092 --> 00:17:28.008
Irena Rosenwasser: It was...

00:17:28.008 --> 00:17:29.238
David Boder: In what month was it?

00:17:29.238 --> 00:17:29.952
Irena Rosenwasser: In May.

00:17:29.952 --> 00:17:30.945
David Boder: In May, but it was cold...?

00:17:30.945 --> 00:17:32.222
Irena Rosenwasser: Very, very cold.

00:17:32.222 --> 00:17:32.428
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:32.428 --> 00:17:39.136
Irena Rosenwasser: Especially at night it was terrible. Then at about six o’clock we were thrown out and we were counted...

00:17:39.136 --> 00:17:41.018
David Boder: What does it mean, thrown out?

00:17:41.018 --> 00:17:45.657
Irena Rosenwasser: We were always beaten, from the first minute the people were beaten.

00:17:45.657 --> 00:17:47.834
David Boder: Who did that?

00:17:47.834 --> 00:17:58.964
Irena Rosenwasser: First of all there were SS men, soldiers, and SS women, with large sticks. ‘Faster, faster, move on, run’. And afterwards there were also Jewish persons.

00:17:58.964 --> 00:18:00.474
David Boder: Capos as they were called.

00:18:00.474 --> 00:18:13.197
Irena Rosenwasser: Where we women worked, there was, for example, a Slovakian woman. She would say to us: ‘Ladies, you never will be ladies again’. That’s how she greeted us, and laughed.

00:18:13.197 --> 00:18:13.740
David Boder: [words not clear]

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:14.578
Irena Rosenwasser: And so it was going on [??].

00:18:14.578 --> 00:18:15.839
David Boder: Yes, now then...

00:18:15.839 --> 00:18:20.851
Irena Rosenwasser: We got very bad pieces of clothing, made out of silk...

00:18:20.851 --> 00:18:21.394
David Boder: Made out of what?

00:18:21.394 --> 00:18:22.480
Irena Rosenwasser: Of silk.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.431
David Boder: What does that mean?

00:18:23.431 --> 00:18:26.244
Irena Rosenwasser: It was a silk dress, the material was silk.

00:18:26.244 --> 00:18:26.772
David Boder: Silk?

00:18:26.772 --> 00:18:27.118
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes.

00:18:27.118 --> 00:18:27.728
David Boder: How come?

00:18:27.728 --> 00:18:29.641
Irena Rosenwasser: Bad, torn clothes.

00:18:29.641 --> 00:18:29.781
David Boder: Yes...

00:18:29.781 --> 00:18:32.656
Irena Rosenwasser: It was very cold there. We had to wear something...[??]...

00:18:32.656 --> 00:18:33.882
David Boder: Yes...

00:18:33.882 --> 00:18:36.757
Irena Rosenwasser: And then we finally entered the lager.

00:18:36.757 --> 00:18:40.667
David Boder: Now about that silk. Do you mean cotton or do you mean silk? [In English] Silk?

00:18:40.667 --> 00:18:41.459
Irena Rosenwasser: [In English] Silk.

00:18:41.459 --> 00:18:42.798
David Boder: [continuing in German] Where did they get it?

00:18:42.798 --> 00:18:45.777
Irena Rosenwasser: The people, [as you know] have brought with them their bundles...

00:18:45.777 --> 00:18:45.932
David Boder: Aha...

00:18:45.932 --> 00:18:46.526
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . to Auschwitz.

00:18:46.526 --> 00:18:47.100
David Boder: Oh...Yes.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.512
Irena Rosenwasser: Up to fifty kilograms...

00:18:48.512 --> 00:18:48.699
David Boder: Yes...

00:18:48.699 --> 00:18:49.898
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . we were permitted to take.

00:18:49.898 --> 00:18:50.240
David Boder: Yes...

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.184
Irena Rosenwasser: And there everything was taken away...

00:18:52.184 --> 00:18:52.417
David Boder: Yes...

00:18:52.417 --> 00:18:56.673
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . And the better pieces were selected and sent away to Germany.

00:18:56.673 --> 00:18:56.828
David Boder: And...?

00:18:56.828 --> 00:18:58.271
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . And we were given the completely torn...

00:18:58.271 --> 00:19:00.583
David Boder: Oh, these were not your own things...?

00:19:00.583 --> 00:19:02.414
Irena Rosenwasser: No, definitely no!

00:19:02.414 --> 00:19:03.893
David Boder: Now then...

00:19:03.893 --> 00:19:15.240
Irena Rosenwasser: And in the morning we finally...it rained, it was cold; everybody was crying, we were in despair and we had a terrible thirst, and...

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.843
David Boder: There was no water?

00:19:16.843 --> 00:19:21.859
Irena Rosenwasser: We were not given any water. It was said that it was dangerous to drink, that there was t...t...

00:19:21.859 --> 00:19:22.821
David Boder: That there was typhus...?

00:19:22.821 --> 00:19:23.601
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes.

00:19:23.601 --> 00:19:24.176
David Boder: Now...

00:19:24.176 --> 00:19:32.280
Irena Rosenwasser: When we arrived in the morning we had to go to the counting lager, the so-called counting lager. We were counted at the gate, before the SS people...

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:32.653
David Boder: Yes...

00:19:32.653 --> 00:19:50.792
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . And we stopped at the kitchen and finally after two or three hours the block elders arrived and counted up thirty, forty people from our transport. And they took those people with them from this block [the words appear clear, but not the meaning]. We arrived in Block 17...

00:19:50.792 --> 00:19:52.938
David Boder: By that time your hair was already shorn off?

00:19:52.938 --> 00:19:53.656
Irena Rosenwasser: Everything was already [done].

00:19:53.656 --> 00:19:53.986
David Boder: Yes...

00:19:53.986 --> 00:19:54.412
Irena Rosenwasser: We were disinfected.

00:19:54.412 --> 00:19:56.504
David Boder: Who did that...?

00:19:56.504 --> 00:19:57.280
Irena Rosenwasser: Their hair...

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:57.874
David Boder: Yes...

00:19:57.874 --> 00:19:59.659
Irena Rosenwasser: The prisoner barbers.

00:19:59.659 --> 00:20:00.967
David Boder: With electrical...?

00:20:00.967 --> 00:20:02.849
Irena Rosenwasser: No, no, no. With scissors.

00:20:02.849 --> 00:20:03.159
David Boder: With scissors.

00:20:03.159 --> 00:20:05.418
Irena Rosenwasser: With scissors or—that did not matter.

00:20:05.418 --> 00:20:06.540
David Boder: Men or women?

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:07.165
Irena Rosenwasser: Women.

00:20:07.165 --> 00:20:09.819
David Boder: Women...Now...

00:20:09.819 --> 00:20:12.710
Irena Rosenwasser: And...I was in block 17...

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:14.437
David Boder: Were you tattooed?

00:20:14.437 --> 00:20:16.009
Irena Rosenwasser: Afterwards...afterwards...

00:20:16.009 --> 00:20:17.643
David Boder: Oh, you have a tattoo number?

00:20:17.643 --> 00:20:17.725
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes.

00:20:17.725 --> 00:20:18.505
David Boder: . . . that is...?

00:20:18.505 --> 00:20:21.826
Irena Rosenwasser: A10421.

00:20:21.826 --> 00:20:29.061
David Boder: . . . 10421. Does the [American] consul take note of these tattoo numbers?

00:20:29.061 --> 00:20:32.956
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes, [a chuckle] but he says that means no preference [by itself].

00:20:32.956 --> 00:20:34.140
David Boder: But he takes note of the number!

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:34.734
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes.

00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:35.359
David Boder: He writes it down?

00:20:35.359 --> 00:20:35.933
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes.

00:20:35.933 --> 00:20:37.505
David Boder: A ten thousand, four...?

00:20:37.505 --> 00:20:38.596
Irena Rosenwasser: .four hundred twenty-one.

00:20:38.596 --> 00:20:39.273
David Boder: . . . twenty-one.

00:20:39.273 --> 00:20:40.317
Irena Rosenwasser: [two words not clear] I got it on my right hand.

00:20:40.317 --> 00:20:40.597
David Boder: Yes...

00:20:40.597 --> 00:20:53.129
Irena Rosenwasser: It was raining and the rain fell into the block. I was very cold,, I was very tired, and was unable to find a place [for myself].

00:20:53.129 --> 00:20:53.237
David Boder: Yes...

00:20:53.237 --> 00:20:56.610
Irena Rosenwasser: There were beds, such three levels...

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:56.812
David Boder: Yes...

00:20:56.812 --> 00:20:57.588
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . made of wood...

00:20:57.588 --> 00:20:57.763
David Boder: Yes...

00:20:57.763 --> 00:21:01.875
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . And in all these beds there were about twelve people lying in one bed.

00:21:01.875 --> 00:21:02.263
David Boder: Yes...

00:21:02.263 --> 00:21:06.251
Irena Rosenwasser: Naturally when a new one would come they did not want to make room...

00:21:06.251 --> 00:21:06.349
David Boder: Yes...

00:21:06.349 --> 00:21:12.824
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . because it was crowded already. The blankets were wet from the rain, because it rained through...

00:21:12.824 --> 00:21:14.179
David Boder: How many people were in one bed did you say?

00:21:14.179 --> 00:21:15.115
Irena Rosenwasser: Ten, twelve...

00:21:15.115 --> 00:21:15.802
David Boder: In one bed?

00:21:15.802 --> 00:21:21.346
Irena Rosenwasser: In one bed—without bedding; so if one had a blanket [a chuckle] it was instantly stolen.

00:21:21.346 --> 00:21:23.259
David Boder: Yes...

00:21:23.259 --> 00:21:29.548
Irena Rosenwasser: So the block-elder came and made order, and I...and so I too, got a place.

00:21:29.548 --> 00:21:29.770
David Boder: Now...

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:32.381
Irena Rosenwasser: I was immediately given something to eat...

00:21:32.381 --> 00:21:32.692
David Boder: Yes...

00:21:32.692 --> 00:21:52.367
Irena Rosenwasser: That was...I don’t know what it was, but very bad...and it stunk badly. I could not eat it at all. The others who had arrived already a week ago were very hungry, and they told me right away, ‘if you can’t eat it, give it to us.’

00:21:52.367 --> 00:21:52.697
David Boder: Aha...

00:21:52.697 --> 00:22:02.318
Irena Rosenwasser: I gave it to them immediately. For two days I was unable to eat. Afterwards, I too, was very hungry. The new ones were not getting any bread at all.

00:22:02.318 --> 00:22:02.726
David Boder: Why?

00:22:02.726 --> 00:22:04.965
Irena Rosenwasser: As long as they had not yet been registered.

00:22:04.965 --> 00:22:05.187
David Boder: Oh.

00:22:05.187 --> 00:22:06.898
Irena Rosenwasser: It took three days...

00:22:06.898 --> 00:22:07.426
David Boder: Aha...

00:22:07.426 --> 00:22:15.158
Irena Rosenwasser: I hardly ate anything for three days, and then after three days [chuckle] the soup tasted good to me.

00:22:15.158 --> 00:22:15.488
David Boder: Yes...

00:22:15.488 --> 00:22:17.805
Irena Rosenwasser: That was something [made] of oats.

00:22:17.805 --> 00:22:18.772
David Boder: Hm...

00:22:18.772 --> 00:22:22.248
Irena Rosenwasser: Without vitamins, without vegetables...

00:22:22.248 --> 00:22:23.866
David Boder: Now then...

00:22:23.866 --> 00:22:27.250
Irena Rosenwasser: And twice a day there was a ‘count appell’.

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:29.144
David Boder: A ‘count appell’. And how was that [done]?

00:22:29.144 --> 00:22:51.534
Irena Rosenwasser: A ‘count appell’ meant that the people in the lager were counted. In the lager C where I was, there were thirty-two thousand people. We had to get up early, it was still dark. A command went through the lager, ‘everybody get up, get up. Fetch the coffee!’.

00:22:51.534 --> 00:22:51.615
David Boder: Yes...

00:22:51.615 --> 00:22:56.873
Irena Rosenwasser: We got bitter coffee, very little. We had to drag the kettles from the kitchen...

00:22:56.873 --> 00:22:57.641
David Boder: Yes...

00:22:57.641 --> 00:23:02.249
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . and then we were all chased out into the washroom.

00:23:02.249 --> 00:23:03.375
David Boder: Yes...

00:23:03.375 --> 00:23:15.931
Irena Rosenwasser: The washroom was rather large; bad, the facilities [?] were very small. We had to wash without a towel, without soap. We tore pieces from our shirts.

00:23:15.931 --> 00:23:16.023
David Boder: Yes...

00:23:16.023 --> 00:23:17.425
Irena Rosenwasser: And with it...that was a...

00:23:17.425 --> 00:23:17.886
David Boder: a towel?

00:23:17.886 --> 00:23:18.582
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . a towel.

00:23:18.582 --> 00:23:20.599
David Boder: And what did you have on your head?

00:23:20.599 --> 00:23:29.026
Irena Rosenwasser: Nothing. That was strictly prohibited. Not a piece of blanket [to cover the shorn head outdoors—see story of Fela Lichtheim-Nichthauser]. That was [considered] sabotage. And nothing, and so we stood...

00:23:29.026 --> 00:23:30.143
David Boder: Where was that, in Auschwitz?

00:23:30.143 --> 00:23:30.900
Irena Rosenwasser: In Auschwitz.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:35.463
David Boder: But the others...In some transports they were given something to cover their heads?

00:23:35.463 --> 00:23:37.111
Irena Rosenwasser: With us it was prohibited.

00:23:37.111 --> 00:23:40.111
David Boder: That was in Auschwitz. Now then...

00:23:40.111 --> 00:23:50.461
Irena Rosenwasser: In the washroom there were always bad fights. The lager
                        capo would come; of course, the people coudd not wash themselves—everybody wanted to wash himself at the same time.

00:23:50.461 --> 00:23:50.568
David Boder: Yes...

00:23:50.568 --> 00:24:11.764
Irena Rosenwasser: And they were just beaten. Then the appell would start. It lasted from about 5:30 to 8 o’clock, or half-past eight. We stood there; and when the number [of prisoners] was correct it was all right, otherwise we had to kneel another two, three hours, or...

00:24:11.764 --> 00:24:13.013
David Boder: What does that mean, kneel?

00:24:13.013 --> 00:24:14.830
Irena Rosenwasser: The whole lager, [had to] kneel.

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:16.105
David Boder: You mean, to stand on their knees?

00:24:16.105 --> 00:24:17.273
Irena Rosenwasser: No.—Yes!

00:24:17.273 --> 00:24:18.814
David Boder: Yes, like in a church?

00:24:18.814 --> 00:24:35.825
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes. [There may be some misunderstanding. The prisoners were often ordered during appell to take a squatting position. See Matzner’s story.] And the German SS women and men would come. They counted; at times they made mistakes, and then we were punished. The punishment consisted, that we would not get bread, or ‘supplement’ [food], or soup.

00:24:35.825 --> 00:24:37.100
David Boder: What was that ‘supplement?’

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:42.558
Irena Rosenwasser: The ‘supplement’ was for the bread. For instance, in the evening we were given twenty deca [about six ounces] of bread...

00:24:42.558 --> 00:24:43.162
David Boder: Yes...

00:24:43.162 --> 00:24:51.960
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . and with it there was a little piece of margarine, or a teaspoonful of marmalade, or a little piece of salami; or something like that...

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:52.057
David Boder: Yes...

00:24:52.057 --> 00:24:52.519
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . was the ‘supplement’.

00:24:52.519 --> 00:24:52.851
David Boder: Yes...

00:24:52.851 --> 00:24:53.724
Irena Rosenwasser: Not always...

00:24:53.724 --> 00:24:54.032
David Boder: Yes...

00:24:54.032 --> 00:24:54.949
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . but still [we got it]...

00:24:54.949 --> 00:24:55.714
David Boder: Yes.

00:24:55.714 --> 00:24:57.239
Irena Rosenwasser: That was in Auschwitz.

00:24:57.239 --> 00:24:58.819
David Boder: And they, they would not give...?

00:24:58.819 --> 00:25:03.838
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . would not give it, because they would not know...

00:25:03.838 --> 00:25:06.317
David Boder: Yes, they were not sure...

00:25:06.317 --> 00:25:20.785
Irena Rosenwasser: They did not count right, and then we were punished for it. And the block-elder used to say, ‘I don’t want to see any sick.’ That was [word not clear due to outside noise] when somebody got sick she was taken to the ‘revier.’

00:25:20.785 --> 00:25:22.780
David Boder: Aha. ‘Revier’ was the hospital?

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:27.886
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . taken to the hospital, and often the people did not return from the ‘revier’.

00:25:27.886 --> 00:25:29.231
David Boder: Hm...

00:25:29.231 --> 00:25:43.744
Irena Rosenwasser: They were removed at night in a black truck, without clothes, and they went to the crematory. So it was better to be ‘well’ even if one was half-dead [pause].

00:25:43.744 --> 00:25:45.555
David Boder: Now, what were you doing?

00:25:45.555 --> 00:25:58.721
Irena Rosenwasser: Now we started to work. The first job for us was to carry bricks from one lager to the other lager. That was rather unpleasant—four pieces of bricks to hold straight...

00:25:58.721 --> 00:25:59.748
David Boder: Why hold them straight?

00:25:59.748 --> 00:26:04.522
Irena Rosenwasser: To march five in a line, with arms stretched out, and to hold them that way.

00:26:04.522 --> 00:26:08.162
David Boder: Well, would it not have been easier to carry them differently?

00:26:08.162 --> 00:26:10.927
Irena Rosenwasser: The Gestapo demanded it that way—that we should carry them that way.

00:26:10.927 --> 00:26:12.835
David Boder: That is how? Stretched out arms?

00:26:12.835 --> 00:26:14.194
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . arms, four...

00:26:14.194 --> 00:26:14.654
David Boder: . . . four bricks.

00:26:14.654 --> 00:26:15.221
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . bricks.

00:26:15.221 --> 00:26:16.714
David Boder: And then?

00:26:16.714 --> 00:26:17.724
Irena Rosenwasser: Three, four times.

00:26:17.724 --> 00:26:19.429
David Boder: You were lined up in rows?

00:26:19.429 --> 00:26:23.471
Irena Rosenwasser: Always five in a row because the people had to be counted.

00:26:23.471 --> 00:26:23.612
David Boder: Yes...

00:26:23.612 --> 00:26:29.392
Irena Rosenwasser: Always when we were leaving the lager, at the gate the SS counted us and wrote it down.

00:26:29.392 --> 00:26:32.092
David Boder: Aha. Now...

00:26:32.092 --> 00:26:36.144
Irena Rosenwasser: And that was the first job—four, five walks [trips] from one lager...

00:26:36.144 --> 00:26:37.864
David Boder: What was that necessary for?

00:26:37.864 --> 00:26:41.290
Irena Rosenwasser: Because they were always building new blocks, block-buildings...

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:45.044
David Boder: Yes...And the bricks were carried without any carrying device?

00:26:45.044 --> 00:26:45.965
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes. Only...

00:26:45.965 --> 00:26:48.036
David Boder: With stretched out arms, and so you carried them.

00:26:48.036 --> 00:26:56.827
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . carried them, and without shoes, because we had no shoes at all. Or wooden shoes. And it was impossible to walk in those large wooden shoes.

00:26:56.827 --> 00:26:58.802
David Boder: And you had the shoes from home?

00:26:58.802 --> 00:27:03.323
Irena Rosenwasser: The good shoes were taken away immediately—exchanged in the bath.

00:27:03.323 --> 00:27:03.656
David Boder: Yes...

00:27:03.656 --> 00:27:08.669
Irena Rosenwasser: Those were the only things that they had permitted, the shoes. But the good shoes they have...

00:27:08.669 --> 00:27:09.450
David Boder: . . . taken away?

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:14.436
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . taken away. And it was always so muddy in Auschwitz.

00:27:14.436 --> 00:27:14.782
David Boder: Muddy?

00:27:14.782 --> 00:27:15.918
Irena Rosenwasser: It always rained...

00:27:15.918 --> 00:27:16.425
David Boder: It always rained.

00:27:16.425 --> 00:27:21.552
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . and the shoes were ‘kaput’ [torn beyond use] in two, three days. The wooden [?] shoes too...

00:27:21.552 --> 00:27:21.840
David Boder: Yes...

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:22.214
Irena Rosenwasser: They, too, were ‘kaput’.

00:27:22.214 --> 00:27:23.313
David Boder: And...

00:27:23.313 --> 00:27:35.437
Irena Rosenwasser: That was the first job. And in addition, three times a day, we had to carry something from the kitchen. In the morning, coffee—only coffee; midday, a soup; evenings, bread with the ‘supplement’.

00:27:35.437 --> 00:27:35.604
David Boder: Yes...

00:27:35.604 --> 00:27:41.082
Irena Rosenwasser: That was...from that one could not die, neither could one live.

00:27:41.082 --> 00:27:41.394
David Boder: Nu...

00:27:41.394 --> 00:27:55.348
Irena Rosenwasser: The lager was rather clean. At the beginning there were no lice, and we were disinfected. There was a delousing every month. But that was also very badly done, because we were compelled...

00:27:55.348 --> 00:27:55.542
David Boder: How...?

00:27:55.542 --> 00:28:06.383
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . to stand the whole night through, outside and wait until we could get into the bath. And again the hair was cut, and that was...

00:28:06.383 --> 00:28:06.902
David Boder: Now describe...

00:28:06.902 --> 00:28:08.017
Irena Rosenwasser: The clothes?

00:28:08.017 --> 00:28:10.104
David Boder: Yes, the clothes...

00:28:10.104 --> 00:28:12.845
Irena Rosenwasser: The clothes were really disinfected.

00:28:12.845 --> 00:28:18.861
David Boder: Now will you describe how that delousing proceeded. How was that done?

00:28:18.861 --> 00:28:22.659
Irena Rosenwasser: The delousing took place in the washroom.

00:28:22.659 --> 00:28:23.540
David Boder: Yes. It was...

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:31.430
Irena Rosenwasser: Not in our lager, but in Auschwitz, because we were actually in Birkenau, up [hill?] Where the lager was located.

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:32.247
David Boder: You were in Birkenau?

00:28:32.247 --> 00:28:35.201
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes. And below also, was Auschwitz, another lager.

00:28:35.201 --> 00:28:36.086
David Boder: Yes...

00:28:36.086 --> 00:28:44.206
Irena Rosenwasser: But we were also in Auschwitz. There were lager baths for disinfection.

00:28:44.206 --> 00:28:48.478
David Boder: There were not the same baths where the people were gassed [gas-killed]?

00:28:48.478 --> 00:28:49.264
Irena Rosenwasser: No...No...

00:28:49.264 --> 00:28:50.027
David Boder: Aha...Yes...

00:28:50.027 --> 00:28:51.413
Irena Rosenwasser: These were not the same.

00:28:51.413 --> 00:28:52.307
David Boder: Now then...

00:28:52.307 --> 00:28:57.592
Irena Rosenwasser: The clothes were immediately taken off...

00:28:57.592 --> 00:28:57.962
David Boder: Yes...

00:28:57.962 --> 00:28:59.646
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . and they were disinfec...

00:28:59.646 --> 00:29:00.256
David Boder: . . . ‘fected?’

00:29:00.256 --> 00:29:01.602
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . disinfected and...

00:29:01.602 --> 00:29:03.259
David Boder: What with?

00:29:03.259 --> 00:29:04.330
Irena Rosenwasser: With a gas.

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:04.849
David Boder: With gas?

00:29:04.849 --> 00:29:05.354
Irena Rosenwasser: We didn’t know [much about]...

00:29:05.354 --> 00:29:05.833
David Boder: Yes...

00:29:05.833 --> 00:29:11.094
Irena Rosenwasser: We didn’t see it. That was also done by prisoners—by men.

00:29:11.094 --> 00:29:14.726
David Boder: Yes. But you got back the same clothes?

00:29:14.726 --> 00:29:16.952
Irena Rosenwasser: No, no...definitely not. That was...

00:29:16.952 --> 00:29:19.473
David Boder: You never got back what you gave them?

00:29:19.473 --> 00:29:21.266
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . Just whatever would come out.

00:29:21.266 --> 00:29:21.609
David Boder: Yes...

00:29:21.609 --> 00:29:23.496
Irena Rosenwasser: One could not choose.

00:29:23.496 --> 00:29:25.926
David Boder: Yes. And one did not have a [identification] number for one’s own clothes?

00:29:25.926 --> 00:29:34.853
Irena Rosenwasser: There were no one’s own. Such [things] did not exist in Auschwitz. The number was never observed, you would always get another number [??]...

00:29:34.853 --> 00:29:35.914
David Boder: Yes...

00:29:35.914 --> 00:29:43.452
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . and then clothes would also disappear, because some people would run and take out more pieces...

00:29:43.452 --> 00:29:43.768
David Boder: Aha...

00:29:43.768 --> 00:29:51.012
Irena Rosenwasser: And then some would remain without clothes. And then everybody got a beating for it, naturally.

00:29:51.012 --> 00:29:51.821
David Boder: Hm...

00:29:51.821 --> 00:30:03.225
Irena Rosenwasser: After the disinfection [?], all blankets were disinfected, also the hair. That always lasted a [full] night.

00:30:03.225 --> 00:30:03.419
David Boder: Hm...

00:30:03.419 --> 00:30:06.065
Irena Rosenwasser: And we stood without clothes...

00:30:06.065 --> 00:30:06.214
David Boder: Where?

00:30:06.214 --> 00:30:09.904
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . and in the morning...in the bathing hall, but it was never heated.

00:30:09.904 --> 00:30:13.729
David Boder: Hm...And the water? Was that cold water?

00:30:13.729 --> 00:30:17.266
Irena Rosenwasser: Oh, it was a bit lukewarm, but it lasted for only two minutes [per person?].

00:30:17.266 --> 00:30:17.555
David Boder: Yes...

00:30:17.555 --> 00:30:18.440
Irena Rosenwasser: We had to got very fast...

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.517
David Boder: What were these, shower baths or what?

00:30:20.517 --> 00:30:21.439
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes, showers.

00:30:21.439 --> 00:30:23.868
David Boder: Showers, Yes. Now...

00:30:23.868 --> 00:30:24.509
Irena Rosenwasser: And so we were, unfortunately...

00:30:24.509 --> 00:30:26.275
David Boder: Did they give you soap?

00:30:26.275 --> 00:30:31.889
Irena Rosenwasser: We got some there, very little—a piece of soap for about twenty [people].

00:30:31.889 --> 00:30:35.199
David Boder: And what did you do then, soap each other?

00:30:35.199 --> 00:30:35.416
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes, we had to.

00:30:35.416 --> 00:30:37.249
David Boder: Yes...

00:30:37.249 --> 00:30:55.389
Irena Rosenwasser: So we would finally return to the lager, and then the appell would start again, the count-appell. Twice a day. In the afternoon it lasted until evening, until late in the evening. Then I was glad when the people were selected [screened] for work. So I got to another lager...

00:30:55.389 --> 00:30:55.728
David Boder: Yes...

00:30:55.728 --> 00:31:16.969
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . and there I succeeded in getting accepted for the kitchen. And I spent about four months in the kitchen. And the whole lager was emptied, about thirty-two thousand people. We did not know where these people were shipped, where they were going. We alone remained in the kitchen.

00:31:16.969 --> 00:31:19.304
David Boder: That is, how many of you remained? There were thirty-two...

00:31:19.304 --> 00:31:22.872
Irena Rosenwasser: In Birkenau there were about two hundred, two hundred fifty [thousand??; numberically these statistics are probably incorrect].

00:31:22.872 --> 00:31:25.369
David Boder: Aha..., and thirty thousand people were selected...?

00:31:25.369 --> 00:31:25.871
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . selected.

00:31:25.871 --> 00:31:27.442
David Boder: And where were they taken?

00:31:27.442 --> 00:31:28.923
Irena Rosenwasser: That was the lager [??]

00:31:28.923 --> 00:31:29.035
David Boder: Yes.

00:31:29.035 --> 00:31:42.268
Irena Rosenwasser: They were taken ‘to transport,’—it was said ‘to transport;’ shipped out of Auschwitz. But I think very few actually got out...

00:31:42.268 --> 00:31:42.868
David Boder: Aha.

00:31:42.868 --> 00:31:45.419
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . of Auschwitz.

00:31:45.419 --> 00:31:49.380
David Boder: Aha. Where were the crematories, in Birkenau or in Auschwitz?

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:52.121
Irena Rosenwasser: In Birkenau, four, and Auschwitz also...

00:31:52.121 --> 00:31:52.675
David Boder: Aha.

00:31:52.675 --> 00:31:54.235
Irena Rosenwasser: They were everywhere, everywhere.

00:31:54.235 --> 00:31:54.436
David Boder: Yes.

00:31:54.436 --> 00:31:59.095
Irena Rosenwasser: And the chimneys one always saw...with fire...

00:31:59.095 --> 00:31:59.850
David Boder: Smoking?

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:00.377
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes, smoking, and fire...

00:32:00.377 --> 00:32:02.215
David Boder: And the fire from...from

00:32:02.215 --> 00:32:03.426
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . tall fires...

00:32:03.426 --> 00:32:03.735
David Boder: Yes...

00:32:03.735 --> 00:32:05.872
Irena Rosenwasser: They were tall flames.

00:32:05.872 --> 00:32:07.258
David Boder: Now...

00:32:07.258 --> 00:32:33.043
Irena Rosenwasser: For instance, I had a girlfriend in the hospital, in the revier. She was already well, and the last day...she already wanted...she already hoped to get out of the hospital...she was gassed. The whole hospital was emptied out and let to the crematories. That was Auschwitz. But in spite of that some [people] have returned [from the hospital], because that was a great theatre.

00:32:33.043 --> 00:32:34.362
David Boder: What does that mean, a ‘great theatre?

00:32:34.362 --> 00:32:43.837
Irena Rosenwasser: I think it was just like a theatre [‘demonstration unit,’ see also page 40] because some [people] were left without legs. For instance, somebody there had one leg...

00:32:43.837 --> 00:32:45.303
David Boder: Yes...

00:32:45.303 --> 00:32:53.132
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . So he remained alive. Mengele wanted to show that he permitted even such people to live. There were also a few children, a few...

00:32:53.132 --> 00:32:53.230
David Boder: Yes...

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:54.106
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . heads.

00:32:54.106 --> 00:32:54.217
David Boder: Yes...

00:32:54.217 --> 00:33:02.779
Irena Rosenwasser: There were all kinds...even a few were sent back from the hospital, so that we would think that our parents were alive...

00:33:02.779 --> 00:33:02.967
David Boder: Yes...

00:33:02.967 --> 00:33:06.660
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . that our siblings are alive, only that they are somewhere in another...

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:06.798
David Boder: Yes...

00:33:06.798 --> 00:33:15.669
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . lager. For instance, if he would empty out a hospital he would say, ‘I am taking these people to a sanitarium, because here the food is not good...

00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:16.022
David Boder: Hm...

00:33:16.022 --> 00:33:20.000
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . neither is the air, so I must give them something better.’

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:20.618
David Boder: Aha.

00:33:20.618 --> 00:33:23.023
Irena Rosenwasser: And so...the people were taken to the crematory.

00:33:23.023 --> 00:33:26.122
David Boder: Well, but the crematory was right nearby, it was known...

00:33:26.122 --> 00:33:35.905
Irena Rosenwasser: No...that was not...we never saw it. We only saw that the transports were departing, where to—we didn’t know. There was always block ‘shut-off.’

00:33:35.905 --> 00:33:36.018
David Boder: Yes...

00:33:36.018 --> 00:33:40.525
Irena Rosenwasser: The people...when a transport was departing, the whole lager had to be confined...

00:33:40.525 --> 00:33:41.241
David Boder: In the block...?

00:33:41.241 --> 00:33:43.792
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . to the blocks, so that we did not know...

00:33:43.792 --> 00:33:44.372
David Boder: Nothing [?] ?

00:33:44.372 --> 00:33:46.621
Irena Rosenwasser: Nothing that happened there...

00:33:46.621 --> 00:33:46.790
David Boder: Yes...

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:59.888
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . Actually...in actuality, and that was...so I was in the kitchen. From the kitchen...the kitchen was dissolved [I do not use ‘liquidated’ because of the specific meaning of the term in the camp lingo]...the whole lager was dissolved...

00:33:59.888 --> 00:34:01.244
David Boder: When was that?

00:34:01.244 --> 00:34:04.085
Irena Rosenwasser: That was in October.

00:34:04.085 --> 00:34:04.282
David Boder: What year?

00:34:04.282 --> 00:34:05.034
Irena Rosenwasser: Forty-four.

00:34:05.034 --> 00:34:06.350
David Boder: Forty-four...Yes...

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:12.000
Irena Rosenwasser: Then I got into another lager. I worked again, because I always wanted to work, because that was the best [to do].

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.775
David Boder: Which lager was that?

00:34:13.775 --> 00:34:17.111
Irena Rosenwasser: That was...first it was a Czech lager...

00:34:17.111 --> 00:34:17.219
David Boder: Yes...

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:22.981
Irena Rosenwasser: From there the Czechs were all led into the gas [chambers]. When we arrived in Auschwitz [It is possible that she has confused the name, or else she used Auschwitz as a general term for ‘lager.’]...

00:34:22.981 --> 00:34:23.078
David Boder: Yes...

00:34:23.078 --> 00:34:27.814
Irena Rosenwasser: It was then a Czech lager...And afterwards it was completely empty [she is possibly confused about the course of events]. And in October...

00:34:27.814 --> 00:34:29.544
David Boder: Were these Czech Jews, or Czechs [in general]?

00:34:29.544 --> 00:34:31.162
Irena Rosenwasser: Czech Jews...Czech Jews.

00:34:31.162 --> 00:34:32.144
David Boder: Czech Jews, yes...

00:34:32.144 --> 00:34:34.116
Irena Rosenwasser: It was a ‘family lager.’ It was interesting [a chuckle]...

00:34:34.116 --> 00:34:34.224
David Boder: Yes.

00:34:34.224 --> 00:34:37.774
Irena Rosenwasser: Women, men, and children were together...

00:34:37.774 --> 00:34:39.371
David Boder: Were you ever in a family lager?

00:34:39.371 --> 00:34:40.220
Irena Rosenwasser: No, I was not.

00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:41.407
David Boder: But you have seen it?

00:34:41.407 --> 00:34:48.956
Irena Rosenwasser: I have seen it. But these people were se...’selected’ [sorted out]. The old, the children, were gassed [gas-killed].

00:34:48.956 --> 00:34:49.077
David Boder: Yes...

00:34:49.077 --> 00:34:52.908
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . We heard that only the young had gone with the ‘transport’.

00:34:52.908 --> 00:34:53.310
David Boder: Yes...

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:54.626
Irena Rosenwasser: Czech Jews.

00:34:54.626 --> 00:34:55.076
David Boder: Yes...

00:34:55.076 --> 00:35:01.873
Irena Rosenwasser: So the lager was empty. There we were taken from the kitchen—we were transferred...

00:35:01.873 --> 00:35:02.758
David Boder: To the Czech lager?

00:35:02.758 --> 00:35:10.512
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . to the Czech lager. There was also a large weaving mill in Auschwitz. So I worked at the weaving mill.

00:35:10.512 --> 00:35:10.814
David Boder: Yes...

00:35:10.814 --> 00:35:14.053
Irena Rosenwasser: We were weaving...we wove some war material.

00:35:14.053 --> 00:35:16.978
David Boder: Aha. Go on...

00:35:16.978 --> 00:35:24.532
Irena Rosenwasser: It was not hard but it was very unhealthy, because it was full of dust. We processed the old rags...

00:35:24.532 --> 00:35:26.597
David Boder: Oh, you processed old rags?

00:35:26.597 --> 00:35:26.854
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes...

00:35:26.854 --> 00:35:27.667
David Boder: Yes...

00:35:27.667 --> 00:35:33.647
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . and the capos were very bad—German prostitutes, women.

00:35:33.647 --> 00:35:34.278
David Boder: Yes...

00:35:34.278 --> 00:35:41.658
Irena Rosenwasser: And they always cursed, ‘Jew-pigs.’ They beat [us] very, very much...

00:35:41.658 --> 00:35:44.398
David Boder: How did the prostitutes get there?

00:35:44.398 --> 00:35:52.044
Irena Rosenwasser: They were the capos. All criminals and gigolos and prostitutes—they were...

00:35:52.044 --> 00:35:52.494
David Boder: The capos...?

00:35:52.494 --> 00:36:06.077
Irena Rosenwasser: They were [one word not clear], they were on top. They could beat, kill, and send to the gas; select mark some people for going into gas, and then they talked about it [make arrangements] with the SS men and SS women.

00:36:06.077 --> 00:36:06.805
David Boder: Hm...

00:36:06.805 --> 00:36:14.228
Irena Rosenwasser: They were not Jews. They were German Arians. There were many Polish and German Arians.

00:36:14.228 --> 00:36:14.880
David Boder: Yes...

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:15.967
Irena Rosenwasser: Also Russians.

00:36:15.967 --> 00:36:17.142
David Boder: Hm...

00:36:17.142 --> 00:36:29.514
Irena Rosenwasser: We were treated very badly, but in this weaving mill we were given ‘supplement.’ That means a half-loaf [?] of bread weekly and some ‘supplement.’

00:36:29.514 --> 00:36:31.334
David Boder: How much bread?

00:36:31.334 --> 00:36:35.087
Irena Rosenwasser: Half a bread; that is, about forty deca [about one pound] bread...

00:36:35.087 --> 00:36:37.222
David Boder: Do you mean, forty deca bread additional?

00:36:37.222 --> 00:36:37.955
Irena Rosenwasser: Additional.

00:36:37.955 --> 00:36:38.393
David Boder: Yes, and...?

00:36:38.393 --> 00:36:40.485
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . a ration for the workers.

00:36:40.485 --> 00:36:40.623
David Boder: Yes...

00:36:40.623 --> 00:36:41.822
Irena Rosenwasser: That was in Auschwitz.

00:36:41.822 --> 00:36:42.997
David Boder: Yes...

00:36:42.997 --> 00:36:54.704
Irena Rosenwasser: And at the end of the year the weaving mill was dissolved and I was assigned to the block [unskilled] labor detail at the Weichsel.

00:36:54.704 --> 00:36:55.688
David Boder: At the River Weichsel?

00:36:55.688 --> 00:36:56.959
Irena Rosenwasser: At the river. That was...

00:36:56.959 --> 00:36:58.110
David Boder: That is Wisla, in Russian.

00:36:58.110 --> 00:36:58.520
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes.

00:36:58.520 --> 00:36:59.181
David Boder: Yes...

00:36:59.181 --> 00:37:02.842
Irena Rosenwasser: That was in December.

00:37:02.842 --> 00:37:03.371
David Boder: Yes...

00:37:03.371 --> 00:37:14.520
Irena Rosenwasser: The weather is, in general, very, very cold in December in Poland, and we were doing earth-work, the hardest earth-work at the river.

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:16.974
David Boder: What kind of earth-work? Fortifications?

00:37:16.974 --> 00:37:17.934
Irena Rosenwasser: Fortifications.

00:37:17.934 --> 00:37:18.547
David Boder: Aha...Trenches?

00:37:18.547 --> 00:37:19.435
Irena Rosenwasser: And the...

00:37:19.435 --> 00:37:20.594
David Boder: Yes...And...

00:37:20.594 --> 00:37:29.744
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . and the earth was frozen. We worked with large hammers, carted the earth with ‘fuhren’ [this word is not clear], and it was five kilometers away...

00:37:29.744 --> 00:37:31.395
David Boder: Mit ‘fuhren’ [?]; Those are just small carts, isn’t that so?

00:37:31.395 --> 00:37:35.237
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes. But that is no work for women.

00:37:35.237 --> 00:37:35.405
David Boder: Yes...

00:37:35.405 --> 00:37:41.397
Irena Rosenwasser: Altogether not for women. We did not eat all day, only evenings.

00:37:41.397 --> 00:37:41.496
David Boder: Hm...

00:37:41.496 --> 00:37:52.321
Irena Rosenwasser: When we returned to the lager we were given something warm. The shoes were very bad, and we walked daily five kilometers [to work] and five for the return. That makes ten kilometers.

00:37:52.321 --> 00:37:53.504
David Boder: Aha. And then...

00:37:53.504 --> 00:37:55.656
Irena Rosenwasser: And always, ‘Faster, faster, run.’

00:37:55.656 --> 00:37:59.496
David Boder: Is it true that you were singing when you marched?

00:37:59.496 --> 00:38:04.830
Irena Rosenwasser: No, we did not sing. But a few had come who did sing.

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:05.567
David Boder: Aha...

00:38:05.567 --> 00:38:07.112
Irena Rosenwasser: We did not. There was always music in Auschwitz.

00:38:07.112 --> 00:38:07.731
David Boder: Yes...

00:38:07.731 --> 00:38:11.462
Irena Rosenwasser: For the details the orchestra played already in the morning.

00:38:11.462 --> 00:38:11.548
David Boder: And...

00:38:11.548 --> 00:38:13.539
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . and the details went to work.

00:38:13.539 --> 00:38:13.882
David Boder: And who...?

00:38:13.882 --> 00:38:14.327
Irena Rosenwasser: And also when...

00:38:14.327 --> 00:38:14.764
David Boder: Yes...

00:38:14.764 --> 00:38:21.257
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . people were led to the crematories, the music always played...

00:38:21.257 --> 00:38:21.925
David Boder: Why so?

00:38:21.925 --> 00:38:26.653
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . The orchestra. That is why I say [chuckle] it was like a theatre.

00:38:26.653 --> 00:38:26.817
David Boder: Yes...

00:38:26.817 --> 00:38:29.011
Irena Rosenwasser: Like about in Nero’s time.

00:38:29.011 --> 00:38:33.006
David Boder: Yes. Now then...

00:38:33.006 --> 00:38:33.373
Irena Rosenwasser: That, that was...

00:38:33.373 --> 00:38:35.696
David Boder: Where did the music play...prisoners?

00:38:35.696 --> 00:38:36.625
Irena Rosenwasser: Prisoners.

00:38:36.625 --> 00:38:37.495
David Boder: Men and women?

00:38:37.495 --> 00:38:42.266
Irena Rosenwasser: Men and women. That was a rather privileged position...

00:38:42.266 --> 00:38:42.562
David Boder: Yes...

00:38:42.562 --> 00:38:49.603
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . to belong to the orchestra, because they had better blocks [quarters] better clothes, and also better food.

00:38:49.603 --> 00:38:55.464
David Boder: Yes. Now then...What were they doing during the day when thery were not playing?

00:38:55.464 --> 00:38:56.006
Irena Rosenwasser: That I don’t know.

00:38:56.006 --> 00:38:58.746
David Boder: Were they free? Did they rehearse?

00:38:58.746 --> 00:39:00.060
Irena Rosenwasser: Possibly yes...rehearsed.

00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:00.578
David Boder: And who was the conductor?

00:39:00.578 --> 00:39:04.084
Irena Rosenwasser: We were interestingly [chuckle] selected for the concert.

00:39:04.084 --> 00:39:05.410
David Boder: Now...

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:12.105
Irena Rosenwasser: There was a square where the prisoners...the music orchestra rendered beautiful concerts [chuckle] for us.

00:39:12.105 --> 00:39:12.240
David Boder: Yes...

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:16.082
Irena Rosenwasser: Instead of bread they gave us music. We got but a little [?] to eat.

00:39:16.082 --> 00:39:17.938
David Boder: Now then...

00:39:17.938 --> 00:39:29.682
Irena Rosenwasser: That was the hardest period in Auschwitz for me—in the exterior detail [those who worked away from the lager] at the Weichsel. Very many people remained there. They were unable to march. They also froze.

00:39:29.682 --> 00:39:29.797
David Boder: Yes...

00:39:29.797 --> 00:39:47.903
Irena Rosenwasser: They simply froze [to death?]. The clothing was insufficient, and to stand all day outdoors without food or drink. Many, many people have died there. Also the Gestapo have killed some people with the shovels. We worked with shovels, and...

00:39:47.903 --> 00:39:48.285
David Boder: Yes...

00:39:48.285 --> 00:39:56.685
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . when we would come to work and were unable to move very fast, she beat us over the head with a shovel, with a hammer...

00:39:56.685 --> 00:39:58.468
David Boder: Have you seen that yourself?

00:39:58.468 --> 00:40:00.538
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes, of course.

00:40:00.538 --> 00:40:00.607
David Boder: An...

00:40:00.607 --> 00:40:04.307
Irena Rosenwasser: [with a chuckle] I, myself, got it too, and did not die [chuckle].

00:40:04.307 --> 00:40:04.457
David Boder: Nu...

00:40:04.457 --> 00:40:07.870
Irena Rosenwasser: Others were beaten, and...

00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:08.812
David Boder: Yes...

00:40:08.812 --> 00:40:21.319
Irena Rosenwasser: For example, when we arrived, there was a certain hill that we could not walk down; it was frozen [slippery from the frost]. So the people were simply pushed down.

00:40:21.319 --> 00:40:21.514
David Boder: Hm...

00:40:21.514 --> 00:40:24.858
Irena Rosenwasser: They would fall down. That’s how they arrived...

00:40:24.858 --> 00:40:27.683
David Boder: Hm...

00:40:27.683 --> 00:40:33.174
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . to work, Afterwards I was picked for ‘transport.’ That was always, always very complicated...

00:40:33.174 --> 00:40:34.337
David Boder: What does that mean, for ‘transport?’

00:40:34.337 --> 00:40:36.398
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . because we did not know what that meant.

00:40:36.398 --> 00:40:36.481
David Boder: Yes...

00:40:36.481 --> 00:40:40.133
Irena Rosenwasser: ‘Transport’—we are going away from Auschwitz...

00:40:40.133 --> 00:40:40.519
David Boder: Yes...

00:40:40.519 --> 00:40:41.773
Irena Rosenwasser: Somewhere...

00:40:41.773 --> 00:40:41.970
David Boder: Hm...

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:43.940
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . and we shall work again.

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:44.262
David Boder: Yes.

00:40:44.262 --> 00:40:46.982
Irena Rosenwasser: But at times it meant the crematory.

00:40:46.982 --> 00:40:48.054
David Boder: Yes...

00:40:48.054 --> 00:40:59.666
Irena Rosenwasser: Eight times I went through selection. The selection meant that we stood completely stripped and the physician of the lager would come and look us over.

00:40:59.666 --> 00:40:59.996
David Boder: Yes.

00:40:59.996 --> 00:41:09.899
Irena Rosenwasser: And the back...If we had the slightest thing on the skin...from [lack of] vitamins, vitamin eruptions, these people were instantly selected.

00:41:09.899 --> 00:41:11.857
David Boder: What does it mean, ‘vitamin eruptions?’

00:41:11.857 --> 00:41:13.585
Irena Rosenwasser: ‘Vitamin eruptions’ means...

00:41:13.585 --> 00:41:14.642
David Boder: Vitamin? [The word before was not clear]

00:41:14.642 --> 00:41:15.347
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes.

00:41:15.347 --> 00:41:16.900
David Boder: But vitamins are something that are [good].

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:20.495
Irena Rosenwasser: Vitamin...You see, deficiency, avitaminosis.

00:41:20.495 --> 00:41:22.439
David Boder: Oh, avitaminosis.

00:41:22.439 --> 00:41:23.056
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes...Yes.

00:41:23.056 --> 00:41:26.788
David Boder: So when it appeared that one was deficient is vitamins...?

00:41:26.788 --> 00:41:27.303
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . that one...

00:41:27.303 --> 00:41:28.852
David Boder: For instance, beriberi.

00:41:28.852 --> 00:41:31.444
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes, for instance...

00:41:31.444 --> 00:41:33.084
David Boder: . . . the mouth is swollen...

00:41:33.084 --> 00:41:34.270
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes, swollen.

00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:35.228
David Boder: The gums are swollen, now then...

00:41:35.228 --> 00:41:40.460
Irena Rosenwasser: The tongue is swollen, and the legs...horrible,—large eruptions [boils]

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:40.634
David Boder: Yes...

00:41:40.634 --> 00:41:41.615
Irena Rosenwasser: From avitaminosis.

00:41:41.615 --> 00:41:43.596
David Boder: Does one get that from avitaminosis?

00:41:43.596 --> 00:41:50.587
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes, definitely. I have seen very many; and I, myself, had a bit of it but not a very large one.

00:41:50.587 --> 00:41:51.420
David Boder: Aha.

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:53.546
Irena Rosenwasser: Some had it on their backs...

00:41:53.546 --> 00:41:53.674
David Boder: Yes...

00:41:53.674 --> 00:42:01.452
Irena Rosenwasser: So Mengele, the lager physician, would come and see it. He would say immediately, ‘These are scabs. Scabby people must step aside.’

00:42:01.452 --> 00:42:01.543
David Boder: Yes...

00:42:01.543 --> 00:42:03.308
Irena Rosenwasser: There was also a scabby block.

00:42:03.308 --> 00:42:03.524
David Boder: Yes...

00:42:03.524 --> 00:42:08.256
Irena Rosenwasser: And the scabby block was naturally, sent to the crematory, and gassed.

00:42:08.256 --> 00:42:08.411
David Boder: Yes...

00:42:08.411 --> 00:42:19.950
Irena Rosenwasser: They would give them something against the scabs. And that was somewhat remarkable—that they would give some medicine. But in spite of that the people were gassed.

00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:20.056
David Boder: Yes...

00:42:20.056 --> 00:42:25.947
Irena Rosenwasser: So that the people should think that they would live...remain alive, and afterwards they were...

00:42:25.947 --> 00:42:26.720
David Boder: Gassed.

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:27.565
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . gassed. Yes.

00:42:27.565 --> 00:42:28.421
David Boder: Now then...

00:42:28.421 --> 00:42:28.970
Irena Rosenwasser: So I was...

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:32.724
David Boder: Tell us something about that selection. You say you went through...

00:42:32.724 --> 00:42:32.724
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes?

00:42:32.724 --> 00:42:33.910
David Boder: . . . eight selections?

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:34.323
Irena Rosenwasser: The selections...

00:42:34.323 --> 00:42:38.668
David Boder: That means, you were told...what would they announce? What did they tell?

00:42:38.668 --> 00:42:51.495
Irena Rosenwasser: The block elder would come, ‘Oh girls, now there will be some very fine work, and a good transport, and all of you should present yourselves for transport, because...

00:42:51.495 --> 00:42:51.919
David Boder: Yes...

00:42:51.919 --> 00:42:53.877
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . it will be exceptionally good!

00:42:53.877 --> 00:42:54.037
David Boder: Yes...

00:42:54.037 --> 00:42:57.416
Irena Rosenwasser: Then there was a count appell again in the lager, a special one...

00:42:57.416 --> 00:42:58.280
David Boder: Yes...

00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:06.209
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . a new count appell, and the SS people would come, and looked the people over. When...

00:43:06.209 --> 00:43:10.032
David Boder: What does that mean? They made you strip altogether naked.

00:43:10.032 --> 00:43:12.570
Irena Rosenwasser: That varied.

00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:13.048
David Boder: Yes...

00:43:13.048 --> 00:43:21.451
Irena Rosenwasser: If there was a selection for...for the crematory, then we did not undress.

00:43:21.451 --> 00:43:21.603
David Boder: Yes...

00:43:21.603 --> 00:43:30.472
Irena Rosenwasser: They just looked over the sicker, the weaker, the thinner people. They were pulled out. We had to form a kind of circle [?].

00:43:30.472 --> 00:43:30.802
David Boder: Yes...

00:43:30.802 --> 00:43:35.352
Irena Rosenwasser: The people were not led out—counted again and led away. These...

00:43:35.352 --> 00:43:35.532
David Boder: Yes...

00:43:35.532 --> 00:43:44.959
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . were designated for gas. But when the people were selected stripped, that meant that they were really being chosen for work.

00:43:44.959 --> 00:43:45.229
David Boder: And...

00:43:45.229 --> 00:43:48.406
Irena Rosenwasser: In this manner I was selected for the kitchen.

00:43:48.406 --> 00:43:48.634
David Boder: Yes...

00:43:48.634 --> 00:43:53.510
Irena Rosenwasser: Completely naked, and afterwards they took blood samples and various other things.

00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:56.338
David Boder: And so the women were completely stripped, and who made the selections?

00:43:56.338 --> 00:43:58.389
Irena Rosenwasser: Completely naked. We held up our shirts in our hands.

00:43:58.389 --> 00:43:59.818
David Boder: Why?

00:43:59.818 --> 00:44:03.071
Irena Rosenwasser: So that he could see us well from all sides.

00:44:03.071 --> 00:44:05.246
David Boder: And who was that...were there women physicians?

00:44:05.246 --> 00:44:10.189
Irena Rosenwasser: The lager physician...No, no, men! There were also SS women present.

00:44:10.189 --> 00:44:15.181
David Boder: Yes. But how many men were present at such selections?

00:44:15.181 --> 00:44:19.030
Irena Rosenwasser: The physician and about two SS men. Not many, two or three.

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:22.848
David Boder: Yes. But these other SS men were not physicians?

00:44:22.848 --> 00:44:30.500
Irena Rosenwasser: No, definitely not! Simply plain soldiers. We were [Footnote 2: The spool ends in the middle of the sentence, This spool appears to be oversize already. Possibly the additional three minutes of wire have been spliced on, or the current might have been slow.]...

00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:42.823
David Boder: [In English] Spool 63...Miss Irena Rosenwasser continues. Spool 62 has thirty-six minutes and has to be checked up.

00:44:42.823 --> 00:44:54.756
David Boder: [In German] Now then Miss Rosenwasser, you were telling me about the selection for...of workers. Will you please again...will you please tell us again about it. [Aside] Speak a bit louder. [Test of microphone] Now...

00:44:54.756 --> 00:45:09.210
Irena Rosenwasser: The selection for work was such that the people had to take off their clothes, and the selection took place at night. And when the physician would...

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:11.629
David Boder: And when the physician of the lager...Yes...?

00:45:11.629 --> 00:45:24.905
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . would find the people strong and healthy, they would really get assigned to a labor detail. And the others still remained in the lager and afterwards they were transported away somewhere.

00:45:24.905 --> 00:45:25.688
David Boder: Yes...

00:45:25.688 --> 00:45:34.801
Irena Rosenwasser: Sometimes the selections were held for medical purposes as well. So the stronger people...blood was taken from the stronger people.

00:45:34.801 --> 00:45:37.291
David Boder: Blood, for what purpose? For transfusions?

00:45:37.291 --> 00:45:39.913
Irena Rosenwasser: For transfusions, for German soldiers...

00:45:39.913 --> 00:45:40.222
David Boder: Yes...

00:45:40.222 --> 00:45:41.101
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . but not for us.

00:45:41.101 --> 00:45:41.873
David Boder: Yes.

00:45:41.873 --> 00:45:43.961
Irena Rosenwasser: There was a war, of course, and they...

00:45:43.961 --> 00:45:44.335
David Boder: Yes...

00:45:44.335 --> 00:45:54.077
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . had to have blood. That was very bad because they would not give better food to people who gave blood...

00:45:54.077 --> 00:45:55.105
David Boder: Did you, too, give blood?

00:45:55.105 --> 00:45:55.722
Irena Rosenwasser: No.

00:45:55.722 --> 00:45:56.433
David Boder: Yes...

00:45:56.433 --> 00:45:56.997
Irena Rosenwasser: No.

00:45:56.997 --> 00:45:57.920
David Boder: And then...

00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:07.028
Irena Rosenwasser: And so at the end of the year I was quite fearful, because I, also, had been assigned to ‘transport’...

00:46:07.028 --> 00:46:07.169
David Boder: And...

00:46:07.169 --> 00:46:14.903
Irena Rosenwasser: But that was a real transport. On the 21st of December we were sent to Bergen-Belsen.

00:46:14.903 --> 00:46:15.062
David Boder: Yes...

00:46:15.062 --> 00:46:23.327
Irena Rosenwasser: We were supplied with some food, and SS people accompanied us. Three days the trip la...

00:46:23.327 --> 00:46:23.468
David Boder: lasted?

00:46:23.468 --> 00:46:24.021
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . lasted.

00:46:24.021 --> 00:46:26.493
David Boder: Where were you? In what kind of cars were you?

00:46:26.493 --> 00:46:28.201
Irena Rosenwasser: We were again in cattle cars.

00:46:28.201 --> 00:46:30.138
David Boder: In what month and year was that?

00:46:30.138 --> 00:46:32.691
Irena Rosenwasser: The twenty-first of December, [the RR-car] it was not heated...

00:46:32.691 --> 00:46:35.234
David Boder: Did they tell you why you were going to Bergen-Belsen?

00:46:35.234 --> 00:46:40.365
Irena Rosenwasser: We were definitely not told where we were going. That was never made known in the lager.

00:46:40.365 --> 00:46:40.590
David Boder: Yes...

00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:44.432
Irena Rosenwasser: The prisoners knew nothing—what that meant...

00:46:44.432 --> 00:46:46.043
David Boder: Were you men and women, or women only?

00:46:46.043 --> 00:46:47.148
Irena Rosenwasser: No, only women.

00:46:47.148 --> 00:46:47.253
David Boder: Yes...

00:46:47.253 --> 00:46:50.834
Irena Rosenwasser: In Auschwitz the women, the men were separated. They were never...

00:46:50.834 --> 00:46:50.980
David Boder: Yes...

00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:56.663
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . together. Only in the family lager [such as she described for the Czech Jews. Gypsies were also kept mainly in ‘family lagers’], but I was not there.

00:46:56.663 --> 00:47:11.058
David Boder: Tell me, how did the people behave in the lager, or here in the transport? The women towards each other? Were they more or less decent? How...how did all that proceed?

00:47:11.058 --> 00:47:21.440
Irena Rosenwasser: Well...a human being always remains a human being. Who was at home a good person, he remained the same in the lager. But...

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:22.929
David Boder: That is you opinion? Yes?

00:47:22.929 --> 00:47:46.865
Irena Rosenwasser: That is my opinion. But some [people] unfortunately, have forgotton. And they would say, ‘I am holding on [?? She says this sentence in Yiddish as if imitating the speaker] so that I should hold out [pull through]; the others do not interest me.’ For example, our block elder [a women] would say, ‘I am a prisoner under protective custody. Nothing can happen to me. But to you—do you see the smoke [obviously a reference to the crematories]? I can have all of you sent there if you...’

00:47:46.865 --> 00:47:47.615
David Boder: Was she Jewish?

00:47:47.615 --> 00:48:06.607
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes...would make sabotage.What was meant by sabotage?We were not permitted to tear the blanket, to take a little piece—because it was so cold—to wear it underneath, under the dress, or...When we were doing something not the way that she had ordered us, she always, always would tell us that she would send us into the gas.

00:48:06.607 --> 00:48:10.024
David Boder: Then this was spoken about openly? They were talking about the burning...

00:48:10.024 --> 00:48:27.766
Irena Rosenwasser: Frequently...Yes...were talking frequently. And she would beat old women. And once I told her, ‘How can she [you] beat such and old woman? That could be my mother, or her [your] mother.’ So she looked at me and replied, ‘My mother, too, was gas-killed. To me it is all the same.’

00:48:27.766 --> 00:48:30.643
David Boder: Yes. Now then...

00:48:30.643 --> 00:48:38.181
Irena Rosenwasser: And so there were people without sentiment, mostly those who were in positions—the block elders, the capos, they...

00:48:38.181 --> 00:48:38.310
David Boder: Yes...

00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:40.792
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . had no scruples anymore.

00:48:40.792 --> 00:48:40.932
David Boder: Yes...

00:48:40.932 --> 00:48:49.167
Irena Rosenwasser: They were already in the lager for three, four years; but there were also [among them?]very good and decent people. And they helped [us] a great deal.

00:48:49.167 --> 00:48:49.836
David Boder: Capos?

00:48:49.836 --> 00:48:51.569
Irena Rosenwasser: Capos, and also...

00:48:51.569 --> 00:48:52.221
David Boder: . . . others?

00:48:52.221 --> 00:48:52.751
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . others.

00:48:52.751 --> 00:49:00.097
David Boder: Now...and so you arrived in Bergen-Belsen. Where is Bergen-Belsen?

00:49:00.097 --> 00:49:04.078
Irena Rosenwasser: Bergen-Belsen is near...near Hamburg, Hanover.

00:49:04.078 --> 00:49:07.007
David Boder: Aha...Yes. In North Germany, North-west Germany.

00:49:07.007 --> 00:49:08.436
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes.

00:49:08.436 --> 00:49:09.524
David Boder: Now then.

00:49:09.524 --> 00:49:15.702
Irena Rosenwasser: We had it good in my transport, because we were not traveling on foot...on foot.

00:49:15.702 --> 00:49:15.796
David Boder: Yes...

00:49:15.796 --> 00:49:20.492
Irena Rosenwasser: Others made the same journey in about a week on foot.

00:49:20.492 --> 00:49:21.869
David Boder: They marched on foot for a week, yes?

00:49:21.869 --> 00:49:30.609
Irena Rosenwasser: On foot. And very many were shot down, [because] they could not walk. They remained behind, so the SS would say, ‘If you can’t walk, then...

00:49:30.609 --> 00:49:31.202
David Boder: . . . we shoot’?

00:49:31.202 --> 00:49:57.160
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . we shoot.’ And they have indeed shot down very many. We arrived after three days in Bergen-Belsen. In Bergen, and from the city of Bergen we went on foot to the lager, Belsen. There, upon arriving, it appeared not to be so tough, not so bad. I thought, ‘Here it will be much better than in Auschwitz.’

00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:57.725
David Boder: Yes...

00:49:57.725 --> 00:50:02.892
Irena Rosenwasser: Indeed, there was no discipline. During the first days there was no count-appell...

00:50:02.892 --> 00:50:03.160
David Boder: Yes...

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:14.411
Irena Rosenwasser: That was a big surprise for us. But there also was no discipline and that was very tough, because the lager was full of dirt...

00:50:14.411 --> 00:50:14.749
David Boder: Aha...

00:50:14.749 --> 00:50:24.361
Irena Rosenwasser: And on the third day I had lice already, and saw lice everywhere. And the food was steadily worse and less.

00:50:24.361 --> 00:50:25.902
David Boder: In what year was that?

00:50:25.902 --> 00:50:27.129
Irena Rosenwasser: ’45, in January.

00:50:27.129 --> 00:50:29.489
David Boder: That was already when the Russians had reached Auschwitz?

00:50:29.489 --> 00:50:34.579
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . to Auschwitz. From Auschwitz...[a few words not clear] remained there. The Russians liberated the few from Auschwitz.

00:50:34.579 --> 00:50:35.050
David Boder: Yes.

00:50:35.050 --> 00:50:36.957
Irena Rosenwasser: But we got out of Auschwitz.

00:50:36.957 --> 00:50:37.166
David Boder: Yes.

00:50:37.166 --> 00:50:40.048
Irena Rosenwasser: And we had destroyed the crematories before.

00:50:40.048 --> 00:50:41.056
David Boder: Who destroyed them?

00:50:41.056 --> 00:50:43.030
Irena Rosenwasser: The prisoners, in Auschwitz. These were crematories where the...

00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:45.636
David Boder: [both talk at the same time] they told to destroy...[?]

00:50:45.636 --> 00:50:56.712
Irena Rosenwasser: [Very excited, she begins to shout]. There were always details assigned...I was there one day, I worked there. I carried bricks, I carried wood, so I saw exactly how it looks.

00:50:56.712 --> 00:51:01.309
David Boder: Now wait a moment. You worked one day in the crematory. When [was that]?

00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:03.846
Irena Rosenwasser: When I was in the transport block.

00:51:03.846 --> 00:51:04.002
David Boder: Yes...

00:51:04.002 --> 00:51:09.600
Irena Rosenwasser: Then we were given just a little bit of work every day, for which we were led out of the lager.

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:16.003
David Boder: Yes. Will you please describe that day for me? Describe for me the day when you worked there.

00:51:16.003 --> 00:51:18.322
Irena Rosenwasser: That day...it was in December.

00:51:18.322 --> 00:51:19.461
David Boder: Yes. Cold?

00:51:19.461 --> 00:51:25.467
Irena Rosenwasser: It was cold. But the crematory detail, assigned to destroy the crematory, was not the worst detail...

00:51:25.467 --> 00:51:27.493
David Boder: Oh, your task was to destroy the crematory...?

00:51:27.493 --> 00:51:28.919
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . it was destroyed.

00:51:28.919 --> 00:51:29.150
David Boder: Yes...

00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:38.210
Irena Rosenwasser: We haven’t seen it at all. Only how it was. How they had all these inscriptions. For example, ‘to disinfection.’

00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:38.435
David Boder: Yes...

00:51:38.435 --> 00:51:45.483
Irena Rosenwasser: ‘To the bathing room.’ The people did not know all together what was going on. They thought it was a bath.

00:51:45.483 --> 00:51:45.904
David Boder: Yes.

00:51:45.904 --> 00:51:49.483
Irena Rosenwasser: There were benches for the clothing, there were even mirrors...

00:51:49.483 --> 00:51:50.053
David Boder: Yes...

00:51:50.053 --> 00:51:53.304
Irena Rosenwasser: They told us the people even received towels when they came in...

00:51:53.304 --> 00:51:53.431
David Boder: Yes.

00:51:53.431 --> 00:51:55.437
Irena Rosenwasser: Soap and towels and this way they were...

00:51:55.437 --> 00:51:55.649
David Boder: Yes.

00:51:55.649 --> 00:51:55.437
Irena Rosenwasser: These were very small gas chambers and they shoved the people into these...

00:51:55.437 --> 00:52:01.218
David Boder: Yes.

00:52:01.218 --> 00:52:03.077
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . and these were shower heads, showers, showers...

00:52:03.077 --> 00:52:03.621
David Boder: Yes, showers.

00:52:03.621 --> 00:52:04.892
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . and no water came from the showers.

00:52:04.892 --> 00:52:06.587
David Boder: Only gas.

00:52:06.587 --> 00:52:09.811
Irena Rosenwasser: And afterward when the door was opened...

00:52:09.811 --> 00:52:10.128
David Boder: Yes.

00:52:10.128 --> 00:52:13.913
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . This was the crematory detail...

00:52:13.913 --> 00:52:14.130
David Boder: Yes...

00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:20.584
Irena Rosenwasser: They would pull out the half-dead people, cut off their hair, pull out their gold teeth...

00:52:20.584 --> 00:52:22.060
David Boder: What do you mean, ‘Half-dead people?’

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:26.161
Irena Rosenwasser: They were not completely gassed—they were not yet...

00:52:26.161 --> 00:52:27.448
David Boder: Who said that?

00:52:27.448 --> 00:52:32.250
Irena Rosenwasser: That we personally heard from the men who had worked in the crematory detail.

00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:35.189
David Boder: So they took out the half-dead people and cut their hair?

00:52:35.189 --> 00:52:36.136
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . cut their hair...

00:52:36.136 --> 00:52:38.586
David Boder: But you told me the hair was cut off before.

00:52:38.586 --> 00:52:42.471
Irena Rosenwasser: But those who went to the crematory were not in the bath [she obviously refers to new arrivals, who were either assigned directly to the crematories or to the barracks. Only the later category went through the cutting of hair and disinfection].

00:52:42.471 --> 00:52:42.796
David Boder: Ah.

00:52:42.796 --> 00:52:43.520
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . that was in the bath.

00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:44.552
David Boder: Yes, yes.

00:52:44.552 --> 00:52:49.138
Irena Rosenwasser: That was...was set up very precisely. Across the rr-station was the crematory.

00:52:49.138 --> 00:52:49.572
David Boder: Yes, and there were...

00:52:49.572 --> 00:52:51.749
Irena Rosenwasser: So directly from the station...

00:52:51.749 --> 00:52:52.320
David Boder: to the crematories?

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:53.267
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . they were sent to the crematories.

00:52:53.267 --> 00:52:54.026
David Boder: . . . to the gas chamber...?

00:52:54.026 --> 00:52:59.500
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . either to the lager, or at selections they were taken to the crematories. That was a daily event, always...

00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:03.522
David Boder: And then from the dead or half-dead people they cut off the hair...?

00:53:03.522 --> 00:53:05.664
Irena Rosenwasser: The hair, and the gold teeth...

00:53:05.664 --> 00:53:06.912
David Boder: Who pulled that?

00:53:06.912 --> 00:53:10.609
Irena Rosenwasser: These...these special commands. The prisoners, unfortunately.

00:53:10.609 --> 00:53:11.703
David Boder: And they had to give that up [hand over the gold teeth to the SS].

00:53:11.703 --> 00:53:17.900
Irena Rosenwasser: They had to do that. And the SS were, naturally, everywhere. The SS did not work, only the prisoners were...

00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:19.710
David Boder: And what did they do with the hair?

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:23.330
Irena Rosenwasser: The hair was used for military material—I don’t know myself...

00:53:23.330 --> 00:53:23.489
David Boder: Yes...

00:53:23.489 --> 00:53:25.712
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . but something was made of it.

00:53:25.712 --> 00:53:26.497
David Boder: Yes, and...

00:53:26.497 --> 00:53:35.299
Irena Rosenwasser: And afterwards they were burned, and they would either burn [??] in four crematories, since there were very large...

00:53:35.299 --> 00:53:35.807
David Boder: Ovens?

00:53:35.807 --> 00:53:38.960
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes, ovens; or outside in the ditch, in ditches...

00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:42.688
David Boder: But...Were they not first put to death? Or...

00:53:42.688 --> 00:53:50.577
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . still, for that they had no sufficient time. Transports arrived incessantly and they worked all day...

00:53:50.577 --> 00:53:50.787
David Boder: Yes...

00:53:50.787 --> 00:53:52.637
Irena Rosenwasser: They didn’t look much...

00:53:52.637 --> 00:53:53.374
David Boder: Yes. Now then...

00:53:53.374 --> 00:54:01.177
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . how far dead they were. But the one day that we worked there, we were only destroying it...

00:54:01.177 --> 00:54:01.512
David Boder: Yes.

00:54:01.512 --> 00:54:08.498
Irena Rosenwasser: It was in December, when the Russians came. We took from there the lumber into the lager...

00:54:08.498 --> 00:54:08.666
David Boder: Yes...

00:54:08.666 --> 00:54:10.866
Irena Rosenwasser: They wanted everything...

00:54:10.866 --> 00:54:11.603
David Boder: It should not be seen?

00:54:11.603 --> 00:54:16.817
Irena Rosenwasser: It should not be seen. There remained only one or two crematories, for the actual dead [who died a natural death?].

00:54:16.817 --> 00:54:18.743
David Boder: Yes...

00:54:18.743 --> 00:54:22.176
Irena Rosenwasser: And so, I was telling about our arrival in Belsen.

00:54:22.176 --> 00:54:23.773
David Boder: Yes.

00:54:23.773 --> 00:55:17.670
Irena Rosenwasser: The first days in Belsen were not so bad, but afterwards I saw that in some respects Auschwitz was possibly better. Because there it was cleaner, there were no lice. And the food, though it was insufficient, one could not die from it. Belsen was much, much worse. Bread about once a week; once or twice we got no bread. That was the punishment, and always thinner and thinner pieces of bread. And the [portions of] soup became less and less. The lager was, so to speak, lice-ridden. It was full of lice, and shit [she uses the German vulgar equivalent]. There were no regualr work details, people did not work, and typhus broke out. I was there. There, too, was a weaving mill...

00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:20.607
David Boder: Did you get anti-typhus injections?

00:55:20.607 --> 00:55:24.509
Irena Rosenwasser: In Auschwitz I was in the kitchen...When I worked in the kitchen, they gave me...

00:55:24.509 --> 00:55:26.709
David Boder: You received typhus injections, yes? [she possibly nodded]

00:55:26.709 --> 00:55:46.483
Irena Rosenwasser: So I worked again in the weaving mill, because I could not lie all day on the bed and look on at how people were dying. I went to work in the weaving mill. But they were unable to keep the weaving mill going, because more and more people got sick.

00:55:46.483 --> 00:55:47.042
David Boder: In Belsen?

00:55:47.042 --> 00:55:53.362
Irena Rosenwasser: In Belsen. Afterwards [?] the lager was divided into separated parts [sections] The healthy...

00:55:53.362 --> 00:55:53.570
David Boder: Hm...

00:55:53.570 --> 00:55:55.871
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . the healthy part and the sick.

00:55:55.871 --> 00:55:57.110
David Boder: Hm...

00:55:57.110 --> 00:56:01.085
Irena Rosenwasser: Here there was no crematory. There was a crematory, but only for the dead [ not for the purpose of extermination].

00:56:01.085 --> 00:56:01.490
David Boder: Hm...

00:56:01.490 --> 00:56:19.385
Irena Rosenwasser: But it was not necessary. I think that as many people died here as in Auschwitz where the people were gassed. All day we saw from the weaving mill the big, big freight carts full of dead [bodies]. They were not covered. A coachman with a horse carted them...

00:56:19.385 --> 00:56:20.535
David Boder: With a horse...?

00:56:20.535 --> 00:56:21.663
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes, [words not clear]

00:56:21.663 --> 00:56:22.432
David Boder: And where were they taken?

00:56:22.432 --> 00:56:25.804
Irena Rosenwasser: Where? To the crematory, [to be] burned. They were dead.

00:56:25.804 --> 00:56:25.993
David Boder: Yes...

00:56:25.993 --> 00:56:37.156
Irena Rosenwasser: They were really dead. Afterwards when the lager-elder arrived from Auschwitz she ordered count-appells. For the half-dead people...count appells...

00:56:37.156 --> 00:56:38.854
David Boder: Who was that? The...

00:56:38.854 --> 00:56:43.834
Irena Rosenwasser: [words not clear, possible a name] she was called. Also a Slovakian woman.

00:56:43.834 --> 00:56:48.399
David Boder: Did you know the woman who afterwards was sentenced [to death] in Belsen, Erene...?

00:56:48.399 --> 00:56:52.080
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes, yes, yes. Irma...Irma Grese [See Fela Nichthauser-Lichtheim story].

00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:52.932
David Boder: Irma Grese...

00:56:52.932 --> 00:56:55.691
Irena Rosenwasser: And Kramer...[he] was our lager
                        commandant.

00:56:55.691 --> 00:56:56.875
David Boder: Did you know Irma...

00:56:56.875 --> 00:56:57.130
Irena Rosenwasser: Grese...

00:56:57.130 --> 00:56:57.860
David Boder: . . . Grese?

00:56:57.860 --> 00:57:00.519
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes. I often was beaten by her.

00:57:00.519 --> 00:57:03.956
David Boder: Would you please describe that woman. There are so many different reports...

00:57:03.956 --> 00:57:04.176
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes.

00:57:04.176 --> 00:57:04.938
David Boder: . . . about her appearance.

00:57:04.938 --> 00:57:12.543
Irena Rosenwasser: Well, Irma Grese was rather young. I think she was about twenty-one years old. She was blond, well Germanic.

00:57:12.543 --> 00:57:13.052
David Boder: Yes...

00:57:13.052 --> 00:57:16.833
Irena Rosenwasser: Very beautiful, just like an actress.

00:57:16.833 --> 00:57:17.999
David Boder: Was she tall in stature?

00:57:17.999 --> 00:57:22.322
Irena Rosenwasser: No. About, say one hundred sixty-two...

00:57:22.322 --> 00:57:22.542
David Boder: Pounds?

00:57:22.542 --> 00:57:23.369
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . centimeters [about 5 feet, 4 inches]

00:57:23.369 --> 00:57:24.666
David Boder: Aha, one hundred sixty-two centimeters...

00:57:24.666 --> 00:57:25.428
Irena Rosenwasser: centimeters. Yes.

00:57:25.428 --> 00:57:26.091
David Boder: Yes...

00:57:26.091 --> 00:57:30.703
Irena Rosenwasser: So. And she was always very trimly dressed...

00:57:30.703 --> 00:57:32.695
David Boder: Was she taller than you?

00:57:32.695 --> 00:57:33.779
Irena Rosenwasser: About the same height as I.

00:57:33.779 --> 00:57:35.443
David Boder: Yes. Now then...

00:57:35.443 --> 00:57:39.093
Irena Rosenwasser: And always with a whip [crop], and revolver...

00:57:39.093 --> 00:57:39.208
David Boder: Yes...

00:57:39.208 --> 00:57:47.946
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . walking around in the lager. And naturally, she looked around...where she could do a bit of cursing [?] and where she could beat up [somebody].

00:57:47.946 --> 00:57:49.906
David Boder: Why was that so ‘naturally?’

00:57:49.906 --> 00:57:53.031
Irena Rosenwasser: She was a real sadist.

00:57:53.031 --> 00:57:55.220
David Boder: Did she have a dog with her?

00:57:55.220 --> 00:58:13.681
Irena Rosenwasser: Dogs? But the SS always had large, very beautiful dogs. She often came with a dog [dogs]. And some people had large bites [wounds] from them. They [would bite] below, at the legs. In the lager Belsen, mostly at work the dogs were...

00:58:13.681 --> 00:58:14.124
David Boder: Set on?

00:58:14.124 --> 00:58:15.184
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes, set on the people.

00:58:15.184 --> 00:58:16.421
David Boder: Yes...

00:58:16.421 --> 00:58:25.825
Irena Rosenwasser: Well, the Irma Grese was really terrible. She took part in all selections and she picked the people to go to the crematory. [This appears, on the surface, in contradiction to her previous statement that people were not directly exterminated in Belsen...A time factory is apparently operative. She may be reporting in part about things that happened before her arrival. See also Matzner’s story].

00:58:25.825 --> 00:58:27.824
David Boder: Yes. Now then...

00:58:27.824 --> 00:58:34.592
Irena Rosenwasser: What can I say about her? I think she was a [she stumbles at the word] fana...a fanatic.

00:58:34.592 --> 00:58:35.823
David Boder: A very fanatic nature...?

00:58:35.823 --> 00:58:42.082
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes, a fanatic Nazi. [She believed] in Hitlerism. She also had a military insignia [of distinction].

00:58:42.082 --> 00:58:46.454
David Boder: Aha. Did she sometimes, make any speeches?

00:58:46.454 --> 00:58:47.997
Irena Rosenwasser: Not big speeches.

00:58:47.997 --> 00:58:49.005
David Boder: What would she usually say?

00:58:49.005 --> 00:59:05.506
Irena Rosenwasser: She would deride us often, derision and so on. We had to take heavy rocks and run with them, and if one could not run fast enough, she would beat her with the whip. That was our sport—kneel and get up again—with the big, heavy rocks.

00:59:05.506 --> 00:59:06.497
David Boder: Kneel with the rocks and get up again?

00:59:06.497 --> 00:59:09.730
Irena Rosenwasser: To run for a distance with them...and...

00:59:09.730 --> 00:59:14.039
David Boder: Yes...

00:59:14.039 --> 00:59:20.993
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . and with...she always wore boots; and with the boots she trampled [kicked?] the people...

00:59:20.993 --> 00:59:21.669
David Boder: Nu...

00:59:21.669 --> 00:59:35.317
Irena Rosenwasser: Blood was always flowing in the lager; be it from the nose, be it from the ear, from somewhere it had to...they were beating in a manner...not just in a simple way, but always so that blood should flow.

00:59:35.317 --> 00:59:36.276
David Boder: Yes...

00:59:36.276 --> 00:59:50.243
Irena Rosenwasser: That was Irma Grese. Kramer was a big, stout man, always with a cigar. He was not often in the lager, but whenever he came we were always punished.

00:59:50.243 --> 00:59:51.851
David Boder: For instance...

00:59:51.851 --> 00:59:55.315
Irena Rosenwasser: [word not clear] no food [?], that was the greatest punishment.

00:59:55.315 --> 00:59:55.808
David Boder: Well...

00:59:55.808 --> 01:00:09.721
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . no food. The blocks were not clean, he would say; or things were not in order outside; the people did not march properly five in a row, they did not march smartly, and we were immediately punished.

01:00:09.721 --> 01:00:10.164
David Boder: Nu...

01:00:10.164 --> 01:00:16.484
Irena Rosenwasser: In Belsen, Kramer made a big speech, that we shall be liberated...

01:00:16.484 --> 01:00:16.697
David Boder: When?

01:00:16.697 --> 01:00:20.419
Irena Rosenwasser: In a short time, about in January.

01:00:20.419 --> 01:00:21.295
David Boder: Yes...

01:00:21.295 --> 01:00:26.235
Irena Rosenwasser: That we obey the lager orders,...

01:00:26.235 --> 01:00:26.974
David Boder: Hm...

01:00:26.974 --> 01:00:34.661
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . and liberty is about to come. Irma Grese herself, told us when the English were already very near...

01:00:34.661 --> 01:00:35.186
David Boder: Yes...

01:00:35.186 --> 01:00:38.255
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . that, ‘I was very good to you, isn’t that correct?’

01:00:38.255 --> 01:00:38.436
David Boder: Yes...

01:00:38.436 --> 01:00:41.971
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . and, ‘We shall all be liberated by the English, ‘he said. [Pronouns are confused.]

01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:43.596
David Boder: Oh, that is what she said?

01:00:43.596 --> 01:00:48.165
Irena Rosenwasser: I am very happy [words not clear]. Prisoners have come and have told us...

01:00:48.165 --> 01:00:48.828
David Boder: . . . that the English were coming?

01:00:48.828 --> 01:00:52.422
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes. So then he wanted to be very friendly and good to us. [It is reported by several sources that during the ‘last days’ the SS depended on information from secret radios which were in possession of prisoners in the lagers.]

01:00:52.422 --> 01:00:54.507
David Boder: Yes. Now then...

01:00:54.507 --> 01:01:40.035
Irena Rosenwasser: And so I worked in the weavery. The weavery was dissolved because the people were constantly sick. And in my block...I happened to get in a horrible block where there were a thousand people without beds, just lying on the bare floor, with the dead among the living. There was no food, and the lice...there were very many lice. Everywhere were lice. And I saw that was the end if rapid help did not come. It was...at the end I was in the so-called death detail. That was the most horrible detail, I think, that could happen in [one’s] life.

01:01:40.035 --> 01:01:40.370
David Boder: What was that?

01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:56.347
Irena Rosenwasser: All day we had to drag the dead out of the block. Daily there were about twenty, twenty-five dead, and we were compelled...there was a big mountain [of dead bodies], the dead could never be buried [on time] there were so many...big mountains, not like in other lagers...

01:01:56.347 --> 01:01:56.643
David Boder: a bit louder...

01:01:56.643 --> 01:02:03.095
Irena Rosenwasser: to drag across the dead, four or five people [to carry them]. We, too, were very, very weak.

01:02:03.095 --> 01:02:03.791
David Boder: Yes...

01:02:03.791 --> 01:02:08.186
Irena Rosenwasser: But in spite of that, since we still got a double [portion of] soup...

01:02:08.186 --> 01:02:09.555
David Boder: Oh. You got some extra soup?

01:02:09.555 --> 01:02:19.104
Irena Rosenwasser: But if we wanted to live we had to do that. It was [word not clear] in the lager. No water for two weeks. Afterwards there was no more butter [margarine]. Some butter was still [she is very excited]...

01:02:19.104 --> 01:02:20.243
David Boder: Why was there no water?

01:02:20.243 --> 01:02:25.649
Irena Rosenwasser: Because they said that the water caused the typhus, and that is why all the water was blocked off.

01:02:25.649 --> 01:02:27.143
David Boder: So what could people drink?

01:02:27.143 --> 01:02:43.202
Irena Rosenwasser: To drink there was altogether nothing. That was very mournful when my girl friend next to me had died and had only pleaded, ‘Erenka, [an endearing form of Erene] bring me some water, bring me water,’ because she had 41 and 42 degrees [Centigrade] of fever...

01:02:43.202 --> 01:02:44.975
David Boder: That was in the block, not in the revier?

01:02:44.975 --> 01:03:03.413
Irena Rosenwasser: They were already all in the block, it was...the revier was...everywhere, before every block there were thrown out twenty-five, thirty dead. And so there was no order, there was no more bread; altogether no more bread was given, only a bit of soup...

01:03:03.413 --> 01:03:06.917
David Boder: Well, when you carried out the dead, could you wash yourselves?

01:03:06.917 --> 01:03:22.492
Irena Rosenwasser: No...that was [the trouble]., that we ate with the same [dirty] hands and without water. In general, there was no water. Some people [of the death detail] have died from infection, of course. And so...

01:03:22.492 --> 01:03:22.613
David Boder: Yes...

01:03:22.613 --> 01:03:46.097
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . the lucky ones; for instance, I remained alive. The strongest, the most beautiful have died [this sounds like a strophe from the Ancient Mariner]. I had a girl friend, eighteen years of age. We were in Auschwitz and everywhere together, and in Belsen she died one day before liberation After liberation the situation was not better, because...

01:03:46.097 --> 01:03:46.353
David Boder: Why?

01:03:46.353 --> 01:03:53.614
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . the forces of occupation brought food, but army food. Canned food, again hard to digest.

01:03:53.614 --> 01:03:53.900
David Boder: Yes...

01:03:53.900 --> 01:04:07.709
Irena Rosenwasser: Greasy soup. The people were badly starved, they ate fast, and became still more sick. I think that after liberation another thirty thousand people died...after liberation...

01:04:07.709 --> 01:04:08.628
David Boder: After liberation?

01:04:08.628 --> 01:04:09.137
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes.

01:04:09.137 --> 01:04:11.786
David Boder: How many do you estimate, were altogether in Belsen when...?

01:04:11.786 --> 01:04:27.351
Irena Rosenwasser: In Belsen...In Belsen it is impossible...one cannot estimate at all because from all lagers people were brought to Belsen. Very many died. But daily transports arrived. So it is altogether impossible...

01:04:27.351 --> 01:04:28.103
David Boder: Aha...

01:04:28.103 --> 01:04:28.356
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . to estimate...

01:04:28.356 --> 01:04:31.957
David Boder: But at a given time, how many people were there in Belsen...at a given time?

01:04:31.957 --> 01:04:32.899
Irena Rosenwasser: That I don’t know...

01:04:32.899 --> 01:04:33.637
David Boder: Aha...

01:04:33.637 --> 01:04:40.110
Irena Rosenwasser: In general we were...we also could not conceive [realize, embrace the idea] that the English were coming.

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:40.321
David Boder: Yes...

01:04:40.321 --> 01:04:44.578
Irena Rosenwasser: We were all so sick. I, too, was [sick]. I had 41 degrees of fever...[Centigrade]

01:04:44.578 --> 01:04:45.787
David Boder: Oh, you yourself got sick?

01:04:45.787 --> 01:04:47.776
Irena Rosenwasser: I did not lie down [??].

01:04:47.776 --> 01:04:47.961
David Boder: Yes...

01:04:47.961 --> 01:05:06.124
Irena Rosenwasser: Not for a moment was I lying down...It is interesting, I know that I was sick because first of all a girl friend told me that she couldn’t sleep next to me because I was so hot. My hair afterwards fell out; and all who had typhus have lost their hair.

01:05:06.124 --> 01:05:08.269
David Boder: Hm...Now...

01:05:08.269 --> 01:05:17.130
Irena Rosenwasser: The ones that laid down never got up. The lice ate them alive. [In these barracks, according to other sources, there was hardly any room to lie down. The prisoners slept sitting on the floor back-to-back.]

01:05:17.130 --> 01:05:18.008
David Boder: Now...

01:05:18.008 --> 01:05:20.387
Irena Rosenwasser: Now then, we were liberated.

01:05:20.387 --> 01:05:24.114
David Boder: Now...tell me, how did the liberation come about?

01:05:24.114 --> 01:05:38.697
Irena Rosenwasser: We did not notice much of the liberation [??]. We could...we did not go around much in the lager. Everywhere the roads were full of dead. They were sitting with their small...what are they called, bowls...?

01:05:38.697 --> 01:05:38.990
David Boder: Yes.

01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:40.605
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . for soup [?]; and so they have died.

01:05:40.605 --> 01:05:42.025
David Boder: . . . and so they died with their bowl of soup?

01:05:42.025 --> 01:05:46.353
Irena Rosenwasser: They were...nobody buried them, nobody carried...

01:05:46.353 --> 01:05:46.678
David Boder: Aha...

01:05:46.678 --> 01:06:01.551
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . then away. No patrols [?] waled through the lager. And we were all so apathetic...I noticed [the liberation because] the Germans were not at the gate anymore.

01:06:01.551 --> 01:06:02.315
David Boder: They had disappeared?

01:06:02.315 --> 01:06:07.651
Irena Rosenwasser: They had disappeared. And a few soldiers...also the Hungarian soldiers who were in Germany, appeared with white ribbons.

01:06:07.651 --> 01:06:07.787
David Boder: Yes...

01:06:07.787 --> 01:06:10.913
Irena Rosenwasser: So I asked one of the soldiers why he wore a white ribbon...

01:06:10.913 --> 01:06:11.238
David Boder: Yes...

01:06:11.238 --> 01:06:15.105
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . So he told me that he didn’t know anything.

01:06:15.105 --> 01:06:15.339
David Boder: Aha...

01:06:15.339 --> 01:06:25.769
Irena Rosenwasser: We didn’t know. We only knew then, when we saw the English in uniform, with tanks...

01:06:25.769 --> 01:06:26.499
David Boder: They entered...?

01:06:26.499 --> 01:06:37.727
Irena Rosenwasser: They entered. I remember that I saw the commander of the lager, Kramer, with—I think, [name not clear] or Eisenhower was there.

01:06:37.727 --> 01:06:37.959
David Boder: Yes...

01:06:37.959 --> 01:06:45.992
Irena Rosenwasser: I don’t remember for sure...And he showed [them] the lager, to those gentlemen. He stood in the automobile and showed them his labor.

01:06:45.992 --> 01:06:46.304
David Boder: Kramer?

01:06:46.304 --> 01:06:56.412
Irena Rosenwasser: The many [?] dead...Yes, Kramer. He said that he wanted to help but that he had no means and could not do anything else.

01:06:56.412 --> 01:06:58.918
David Boder: You have then...Oh, yes, Kramer was afterward hanged.

01:06:58.918 --> 01:07:01.659
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes, in Duna...[?] was the trail.

01:07:01.659 --> 01:07:02.051
David Boder: Yes.

01:07:02.051 --> 01:07:05.757
Irena Rosenwasser: Grese, and Kramer were there, and a few SS were hanged.

01:07:05.757 --> 01:07:06.786
David Boder: Yes. Now then...

01:07:06.786 --> 01:07:16.628
Irena Rosenwasser: Such was the liberation. The English came afterwards and really disinfected us; not like in Auschwitz but with a powder which was [word not clear]...

01:07:16.628 --> 01:07:17.207
David Boder: Yes. With DDT.

01:07:17.207 --> 01:07:20.623
Irena Rosenwasser: And the sick, the gravely ill...

01:07:20.623 --> 01:07:22.827
David Boder: How did they do that? The powder...

01:07:22.827 --> 01:07:25.262
Irena Rosenwasser: So, with a...

01:07:25.262 --> 01:07:26.057
David Boder: . . . with sprayers?

01:07:26.057 --> 01:07:34.749
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes. It was very pleasant. The lice disappeared immediately. They reappeared afterwards again, and again we were given of the same...

01:07:34.749 --> 01:07:35.318
David Boder: Yes...

01:07:35.318 --> 01:07:57.327
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . the powder. And so it became better from day to day...First of all, I cannot describe what the conditions were like in the lager. There was no toilet. Everything [was done] in the open [word not clear] the whole block was in such a condition, because in typhus one has terrible diarrhea.

01:07:57.327 --> 01:08:01.500
David Boder: Yes. Which kind was that—typhoid or spotted typhus?

01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:03.002
Irena Rosenwasser: There were both.

01:08:03.002 --> 01:08:06.885
David Boder: Both typhuses. And the diarrhea...and there were no toilets.

01:08:06.885 --> 01:08:12.183
Irena Rosenwasser: No toilets. And the block was full of it, the yard and everywhere, everywhere.

01:08:12.183 --> 01:08:14.339
David Boder: And who removed all that?

01:08:14.339 --> 01:08:23.466
Irena Rosenwasser: The SS people. The English brought the SS afterwards and they put the place in order. And they afterwards dragged the dead, not we, not the death detail.

01:08:23.466 --> 01:08:23.730
David Boder: Aha...

01:08:23.730 --> 01:08:25.463
Irena Rosenwasser: [a chuckle] We, too, were half-dead...

01:08:25.463 --> 01:08:27.667
David Boder: Did you talk with the SS? How was that, then? [??]

01:08:27.667 --> 01:08:36.352
Irena Rosenwasser: Not at all. The men, the people from the lager have thrown rocks, but the English told us that was not our business.

01:08:36.352 --> 01:08:37.292
David Boder: Hm...

01:08:37.292 --> 01:08:44.369
Irena Rosenwasser: And the SS women worked afterwards, we saw that. And they had the dead...

01:08:44.369 --> 01:08:45.076
David Boder: . . . removed?

01:08:45.076 --> 01:09:01.382
Irena Rosenwasser: removed. [There is not an iota of satisfaction or enthusiasm in her voice. She sounds weak as if the indifference and exhaustion of those days have come again over her.] Add there is a cemetery, a large cemetery, in Bergen-Belsen. And we were transported to a different lager, to a new lager, where the SS themselves, had lived. Large buildings, healthy buildings, with windows...

01:09:01.382 --> 01:09:02.408
David Boder: Near Bergen-Belsen?

01:09:02.408 --> 01:09:03.338
Irena Rosenwasser: Near...

01:09:03.338 --> 01:09:04.220
David Boder: Yes...

01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:06.402
Irena Rosenwasser: Near Belsen, at the station.

01:09:06.402 --> 01:09:07.300
David Boder: Yes...

01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:14.275
Irena Rosenwasser: Near Bergen-Belsen. There it was much, much, better. A larger kitchen...

01:09:14.275 --> 01:09:14.425
David Boder: Yes...

01:09:14.425 --> 01:09:18.062
Irena Rosenwasser: A clean kitchen. We got clothes, food...

01:09:18.062 --> 01:09:20.100
David Boder: Who brought that?

01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:40.018
Irena Rosenwasser: The American Joint Committee was there. Jewish [?] relief and the British Red Cross, various big organ...organizations. They supplied all the people with clothing, the best...good...the best food...

01:09:40.018 --> 01:09:42.238
David Boder: Did you have beds for yourself then? [chuckle]

01:09:42.238 --> 01:09:44.235
Irena Rosenwasser: Everybody. One person in each bed.

01:09:44.235 --> 01:09:45.117
David Boder: Yes...

01:09:45.117 --> 01:09:59.687
Irena Rosenwasser: But unfortunately many, many died afterwards from exhaustion. They could not...they were...For example, some were [weighed] twenty-five kilograms [about fifty-five pounds]. I was [weighed] thirty-five kilograms. Now I am [weigh] fifty-five, so I have gained twenty kilograms.

01:09:59.687 --> 01:10:01.885
David Boder: Well, you don’t look too stout [chuckle].

01:10:01.885 --> 01:10:03.755
Irena Rosenwasser: No [chuckle].

01:10:03.755 --> 01:10:08.348
David Boder: Now, tell me where did you go then from Bergen-Belsen?

01:10:08.348 --> 01:10:10.647
Irena Rosenwasser: I worked.

01:10:10.647 --> 01:10:11.083
David Boder: Where?

01:10:11.083 --> 01:10:16.561
Irena Rosenwasser: In the Army Post Office, British post office, because I speak a bit of English.

01:10:16.561 --> 01:10:16.816
David Boder: Yes...

01:10:16.816 --> 01:10:20.023
Irena Rosenwasser: And French, various languages, and...

01:10:20.023 --> 01:10:21.663
David Boder: Did they pay for the work?

01:10:21.663 --> 01:10:24.431
Irena Rosenwasser: They paid something, in marks...

01:10:24.431 --> 01:10:24.600
David Boder: Yes...

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:42.312
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . in military marks. And we got cigarettes, and packages, those [words not clear] gift packages [?]. That was very pleasant. And it was nice work, in general, to forward the letters for the people. With the military mail we have...

01:10:42.312 --> 01:10:42.674
David Boder: done that?

01:10:42.674 --> 01:10:43.023
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . done that.

01:10:43.023 --> 01:10:44.811
David Boder: And then...

01:10:44.811 --> 01:10:57.841
Irena Rosenwasser: And then I stayed in Belsen. I worked there until October, and in October, traveling with a convoy of the American Joint [Distribution Committee] from Bergen-Belsen through Belgium, I arrived in Paris.

01:10:57.841 --> 01:11:00.726
David Boder: Why didn’t you return to Hungary?

01:11:00.726 --> 01:11:05.824
Irena Rosenwasser: Because I knew, I have nobody there to look for [voice fades].

01:11:05.824 --> 01:11:08.331
David Boder: A bit louder.

01:11:08.331 --> 01:11:30.284
Irena Rosenwasser: You know...that unfortunately I have no business there; because my brothers were lively [active] young people and they...we knew already...I was in Belsen from the fifteenth of April when we were liberated, until October...and I did not receive any word. And many have returned again from Hungary, they were in Hungary and have come back...

01:11:30.284 --> 01:11:32.292
David Boder: Now what does that mean? They went from Belsen to Hungary...?

01:11:32.292 --> 01:11:33.860
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . went to Hungary...

01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:34.796
David Boder: And then they returned...?

01:11:34.796 --> 01:11:40.115
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . and then they returned, because they found nobody there and had only terrible worries.

01:11:40.115 --> 01:11:40.336
David Boder: Yes...

01:11:40.336 --> 01:11:46.207
Irena Rosenwasser: Difficulties and worries, and they have decided to emigrate, and from a lager that was...

01:11:46.207 --> 01:11:46.529
David Boder: . . . easier?

01:11:46.529 --> 01:11:47.261
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . easier.

01:11:47.261 --> 01:11:47.630
David Boder: And then how...

01:11:47.630 --> 01:11:55.897
Irena Rosenwasser: When they returned, I wrote immediately and I received word that, unfortunately, nobody of my family was home.

01:11:55.897 --> 01:11:56.403
David Boder: Yes.

01:11:56.403 --> 01:12:07.475
Irena Rosenwasser: So there was no purpose for me to return, because I, too, wish to emigrate to America, and have received an affidavit already in Belsen...

01:12:07.475 --> 01:12:08.028
David Boder: Aha...

01:12:08.028 --> 01:12:12.514
Irena Rosenwasser: . . . to go to America, and on that basis I have come to Paris.

01:12:12.514 --> 01:12:16.126
David Boder: Oh, You are in France for the first time?

01:12:16.126 --> 01:12:16.600
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes.

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:16.819
David Boder: Yes...

01:12:16.819 --> 01:12:24.972
Irena Rosenwasser: I was never in France before. In a week I found employment, a position here with the Joint, and since then I work here.

01:12:24.972 --> 01:12:25.363
David Boder: Aha...

01:12:25.363 --> 01:12:32.783
Irena Rosenwasser: And I am waiting to emigrate. [There are a few words aside of...the microphone. There is apparently a reference to Los Angeles]

01:12:32.783 --> 01:12:37.425
David Boder: You will have to look up my daughter. She is a physician there.

01:12:37.425 --> 01:12:38.180
Irena Rosenwasser: Aha...

01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:42.035
David Boder: And her husband is a physician. She is Dr. Boder.

01:12:42.035 --> 01:12:42.431
Irena Rosenwasser: Boder...

01:12:42.431 --> 01:12:43.742
David Boder: My name, too, is Boder.

01:12:43.742 --> 01:12:46.677
Irena Rosenwasser: Could you possibly, give me the address?

01:12:46.677 --> 01:12:48.197
David Boder: Give me your address.

01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:50.388
Irena Rosenwasser: Yes.

01:12:50.388 --> 01:13:21.199
David Boder: [In English] Now then, this concludes the interview with Erene [Irene] Rosen...Rosenwasser, Spool 63. The beginning is on Spool 62, Paris, August 22, 1946. Would you say it in English, your address — the address of your uncle in Los Angeles. Will you say that?

01:13:21.199 --> 01:13:33.960
Irena Rosenwasser: [first name not clear] Golder...Goldberger, 2417 [?] Street, Calif...Los Angeles 33, California.

01:13:33.960 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: Aha...All right.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Irena Rosenwasser: I graduated from the Gymnasium, passed my ‘Maturity Examination’ [a special European degree].

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: Aha...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Irena Rosenwasser: Afterwards I studied [term designates university training], but I did not complete my training.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: What did you take up?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Irena Rosenwasser: I took up Latin literature and history.

00:00:00.000 --> 01:13:30.567
David Boder: Aha...
