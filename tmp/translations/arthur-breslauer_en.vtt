00:00:24.313 --> 00:00:32.507
David Boder: [In German] So, do you, Mr. Breslauer, want to give us your full name again, and tell us how old you are and where were you born?

00:00:32.507 --> 00:00:40.279
Arthur Breslauer: My name is Arthur Breslauer, I am fift—...fifty-four years old, I was born in Hungary.

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:57.160
David Boder: I see. Tell us, Mr. Breslauer, err, where has, where were you, when the war began, where did you experience the beginning of the war and what happened to you afterwards?

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:06.888
Arthur Breslauer: When the war began, I was in Budapest, where I had lived for thirty-five years, and where I had been an independent corn- and stock-broker.

00:01:06.888 --> 00:01:08.212
David Boder: Corn- and what?

00:01:08.212 --> 00:01:09.295
Arthur Breslauer: Stock broker.

00:01:09.295 --> 00:01:18.684
David Boder: Yes. If you don’t talk loudly enough, this lamp here will light up, alright? It shows that, err...corn and ?

00:01:18.684 --> 00:01:19.566
Arthur Breslauer: Stock broker.

00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:24.570
David Boder: What does that mean, “stock broker”?

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.954
Arthur Breslauer: [pause] Securities dealer.

00:01:25.954 --> 00:01:29.084
David Boder: Oh! So, corn and with securities.

00:01:29.084 --> 00:01:34.991
Arthur Breslauer: At the Budapest stock exchange, I worked for thirty-five years, twenty-five years of those as an independent dealer.

00:01:34.991 --> 00:01:38.129
David Boder: Yes. So you were a member of the stock exchange.

00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:40.567
Arthur Breslauer: Yes, a commission agent.

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:44.578
David Boder: You were a commission agent at the stock exchange and dealt in corn on commission and...

00:01:44.578 --> 00:01:45.842
Arthur Breslauer: Also on commission.

00:01:45.842 --> 00:01:46.543
David Boder: And...

00:01:46.543 --> 00:01:49.522
Arthur Breslauer: Partly on commission, partly pro per...

00:01:49.522 --> 00:01:53.795
David Boder: So, you were born in Hungary, but you lived in Romania.

00:01:53.795 --> 00:01:54.737
Arthur Breslauer: No, in Budapest.

00:01:54.737 --> 00:01:57.875
David Boder: Oh, Buda—...Excuse me! I thought you said Bucharest.

00:01:57.875 --> 00:01:58.507
Arthur Breslauer: Budapest, the capital of Hungary.

00:01:58.507 --> 00:02:05.518
David Boder: Budapest. The capital of Hungary. Well, where were you, when the war started?

00:02:05.518 --> 00:02:25.071
Arthur Breslauer: I was at home in Budapest. And when the deportations started in 1944 and when they took place in a large scale, in the province...

00:02:25.071 --> 00:02:25.493
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:25.493 --> 00:02:43.947
Arthur Breslauer: We felt very threatened and so, we were, together with the known group of seventeen hundred souls deported to Germany, namely to Bergen...Bergen-Belsen.

00:02:43.947 --> 00:02:49.514
David Boder: So, wait. That is a bit too fast for me. When did the Germans arrive in Bucharest?

00:02:49.514 --> 00:02:50.311
Arthur Breslauer: In Budapest!

00:02:50.311 --> 00:02:51.885
David Boder: Arrive in Budapest!

00:02:51.885 --> 00:02:55.866
Arthur Breslauer: On March 19th, 1944.

00:02:55.866 --> 00:02:59.245
David Boder: Well, what did they tell you then?

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:06.226
Arthur Breslauer: They...[unintelligible] then calmed everybody down...that...the Jews, the Jewish, the Jewish people...

00:03:06.226 --> 00:03:06.918
David Boder: Society.

00:03:06.918 --> 00:03:35.864
Arthur Breslauer: Society, that, if not already happened, everybody can practice their Jewish culture...and as it turned out, err, this announcement had only the goal to, to, not to...

00:03:35.864 --> 00:03:37.399
David Boder: Not to stir things up.

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:42.403
Arthur Breslauer: Yes, not to stir things up, so that they could carry out their plan unhindered.

00:03:42.403 --> 00:03:44.269
David Boder: And what was this plan?

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:50.928
Arthur Breslauer: The plan was, as it turned out, the annihilation of the Jews.

00:03:50.928 --> 00:03:53.134
David Boder: Ah, I see. And then?

00:03:53.134 --> 00:03:55.159
Arthur Breslauer: The systematic annihilation.

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:57.657
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:57.657 --> 00:04:22.484
Arthur Breslauer: And when the Jews in the province got deported, that is, when it was already happening, and the deportations were approaching Budapest, in [unintelligible; could be “Kispest”?], we decided to join, err...this group...

00:04:22.484 --> 00:04:23.718
David Boder: Which group?

00:04:23.718 --> 00:04:26.525
Arthur Breslauer: The seventeen hundred souls [people]...

00:04:26.525 --> 00:04:28.812
David Boder: What kind of group was this?

00:04:28.812 --> 00:04:36.034
Arthur Breslauer: A so-called deal had been made, with these seventeen hundred people.

00:04:36.034 --> 00:04:37.066
David Boder: I see.

00:04:37.066 --> 00:04:48.260
Arthur Breslauer: They were brought to Germany, with the promise that they would be brought further later on...

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:58.139
David Boder: Oh! So, it was...a deal was made that...there were seventeen hundred people and they wanted to go to Palestine and they should...[unintelligible]...

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.766
Arthur Breslauer: They told us Spain.

00:05:00.766 --> 00:05:02.310
David Boder: Yes. Well?

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.462
Arthur Breslauer: Over a detour.

00:05:03.462 --> 00:05:07.675
David Boder: How was this arranged? How was this possible?

00:05:07.675 --> 00:05:12.219
Arthur Breslauer: We were led, err, ordered in a camp.

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:19.961
David Boder: No, I mean, how was it possible that this whole thing was agreed with the Germans?

00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:46.127
Arthur Breslauer: It was a man called Dr. Kasztner. He organized it. And that was a great, a generous, a great plan, which was only realized in part. Our group was a so-called model-group.

00:05:46.127 --> 00:05:47.520
David Boder: Yes.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.356
Arthur Breslauer: As an experiment.

00:05:49.356 --> 00:05:50.448
David Boder: Yes.

00:05:50.448 --> 00:06:00.649
Arthur Breslauer: And since we were in danger that the deportion...dep—...dep—...deportation was also...

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:02.373
David Boder: Yes, threatening...

00:06:02.373 --> 00:06:06.616
Arthur Breslauer: Threatening us, we ventured on...

00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:07.738
David Boder: On this undertaking.

00:06:07.738 --> 00:06:15.622
Arthur Breslauer: On this undertaking. Yes, and because everything was very, very uncertain.

00:06:15.622 --> 00:06:18.481
David Boder: Yes. Well?

00:06:18.481 --> 00:06:37.296
Arthur Breslauer: Then we were put into rail cars, that is sixty to seventy-five people in each carriage, and we rode the train, err, many, eleven days.

00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:38.320
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.368
Arthur Breslauer: Until we arrived in Bergen-Belsen.

00:06:41.368 --> 00:06:41.940
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:48.539
Arthur Breslauer: There, the seventeen hundred people were put into two barracks.

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:49.691
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:49.691 --> 00:06:53.603
Arthur Breslauer: Under very difficult conditions.

00:06:53.603 --> 00:06:55.198
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:55.198 --> 00:07:16.060
Arthur Breslauer: Crammed together. There we were for six weeks. During these six weeks, I lost my unforgettable, older daughter of seventeen and a half years.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:16.581
David Boder: How?

00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:18.335
Arthur Breslauer: She died.

00:07:18.335 --> 00:07:19.900
David Boder: How did she die?

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.654
Arthur Breslauer: Pneumonia.

00:07:21.654 --> 00:07:22.226
David Boder: Where was this?

00:07:22.226 --> 00:07:24.010
Arthur Breslauer: In Bergen-Belsen.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.929
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:26.929 --> 00:07:29.607
Arthur Breslauer: It was terrible, dreadful.

00:07:29.607 --> 00:07:33.098
David Boder: How many people were there altogether in your family?

00:07:33.098 --> 00:07:34.822
Arthur Breslauer: We were four.

00:07:34.822 --> 00:07:35.544
David Boder: Who was that?

00:07:35.544 --> 00:07:41.803
Arthur Breslauer: My wife, a high school teacher, with a doctor in mathematics.

00:07:41.803 --> 00:07:42.616
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:42.616 --> 00:07:44.190
Arthur Breslauer: My two daughters.

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:44.771
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:44.771 --> 00:07:46.736
Arthur Breslauer: Two very kind children.

00:07:46.736 --> 00:07:48.370
David Boder: Where is the other one now?

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:51.057
Arthur Breslauer: The other one is now with us.

00:07:51.057 --> 00:07:51.569
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:51.569 --> 00:07:55.821
Arthur Breslauer: She goes to the “Gymnasium” here.

00:07:55.821 --> 00:07:56.402
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:56.402 --> 00:07:59.811
Arthur Breslauer: A very talented person.

00:07:59.811 --> 00:08:05.047
David Boder: How old was she, when you, err, went, when you were deported?

00:08:05.047 --> 00:08:07.102
Arthur Breslauer: The little one was eleven years old.

00:08:07.102 --> 00:08:07.614
David Boder: Yes.

00:08:07.614 --> 00:08:09.248
Arthur Breslauer: She’s now thirteen and a half.

00:08:09.248 --> 00:08:14.282
David Boder: Well, how long was the train ride from Budapest to Belsen-Belsen?

00:08:14.282 --> 00:08:15.245
Arthur Breslauer: Eleven days.

00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:20.550
David Boder: What kind of train was provided?

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.124
Arthur Breslauer: A livestock cargo train!

00:08:22.124 --> 00:08:23.066
David Boder: A livestock cargo train!

00:08:23.066 --> 00:08:23.105
Arthur Breslauer: A livestock cargo train! Yes.

00:08:23.105 --> 00:08:24.941
David Boder: And that was the “model-group,” right?

00:08:24.941 --> 00:08:25.853
Arthur Breslauer: A livestock cargo train.

00:08:25.853 --> 00:08:27.968
David Boder: Were you also locked into this train?

00:08:27.968 --> 00:08:35.100
Arthur Breslauer: Yes! Yes. We weren’t locked in, that is, err,...the doors were open.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.313
David Boder: Yes.

00:08:36.313 --> 00:08:42.099
Arthur Breslauer: But it was a horrible ride.

00:08:42.099 --> 00:08:45.500
David Boder: Why?

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:53.032
Arthur Breslauer: Into a train car, which normally only holds forty people, they put, err...

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:53.553
David Boder: Yes.

00:08:53.553 --> 00:08:59.129
Arthur Breslauer: They put in sixty, seventy-five people.

00:08:59.129 --> 00:09:00.793
David Boder: Yes. Men, women and children?

00:09:00.793 --> 00:09:03.179
Arthur Breslauer: Men, women, children. All together.

00:09:03.179 --> 00:09:05.225
David Boder: Was there a restroom on the train?

00:09:05.225 --> 00:09:06.218
Arthur Breslauer: Never.

00:09:06.218 --> 00:09:09.679
David Boder: So, how did you satisfy the elementary needs?

00:09:09.679 --> 00:09:14.171
Arthur Breslauer: From time to time, the, err, the train stopped.

00:09:14.171 --> 00:09:15.676
David Boder: And the children?

00:09:15.676 --> 00:09:18.604
Arthur Breslauer: The children did, err, also...

00:09:18.604 --> 00:09:22.164
David Boder: Yes, I mean, when they needed to use the bathroom?

00:09:22.164 --> 00:09:25.212
Arthur Breslauer: They couldn’t relieve themselves.

00:09:25.212 --> 00:09:30.117
David Boder: Well?...Well?

00:09:30.117 --> 00:09:33.647
Arthur Breslauer: So, they, err, they suffered.

00:09:33.647 --> 00:09:37.387
David Boder: Did they not try to somehow do that in the car?

00:09:37.387 --> 00:09:45.361
Arthur Breslauer: I think, it happened, quite often. It was avoidable. [He clearly means “unavoidable”]

00:09:45.361 --> 00:09:48.430
David Boder: Yes. And how was that done?

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:52.192
Arthur Breslauer: In front of the people. In front of everybody, yes.

00:09:52.192 --> 00:09:58.791
David Boder: Yes, well, err, then, after eleven days, you arrived in Belsen-Belsen?

00:09:58.791 --> 00:09:59.763
Arthur Breslauer: Bergen-Belsen.

00:09:59.763 --> 00:10:05.248
David Boder: Do you want to describe a little bit...what did it look like, when you arrived there?

00:10:05.248 --> 00:10:09.401
Arthur Breslauer: Well, we were in a so-called “privileged” group.

00:10:09.401 --> 00:10:10.614
David Boder: Yes.

00:10:10.614 --> 00:10:25.277
Arthur Breslauer: That meant that we only had to do chores in the house, that is, what we...in the camp...

00:10:25.277 --> 00:10:26.008
David Boder: Needed.

00:10:26.008 --> 00:10:27.272
Arthur Breslauer: Needed.

00:10:27.272 --> 00:10:30.380
David Boder: Were women and children in the same barracks as the men?

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:35.315
Arthur Breslauer: No, women had their own barracks. Men, too.

00:10:35.315 --> 00:10:38.264
David Boder: Who was with you? Just the Hungarian group?

00:10:38.264 --> 00:10:43.870
Arthur Breslauer: The Hungarian group, to which also many Yugoslavs and Romanians belonged.

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:44.962
David Boder: Christians or Jews?

00:10:44.962 --> 00:10:46.226
Arthur Breslauer: Only Jews.

00:10:46.226 --> 00:10:50.439
David Boder: Only Jews. Well, they didn’t force you to work.

00:10:50.439 --> 00:10:50.719
Arthur Breslauer: No.

00:10:50.719 --> 00:10:52.804
David Boder: How were you fed?

00:10:52.804 --> 00:11:08.120
Arthur Breslauer: We received the usual food. It was a kind of stew with...

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:08.361
David Boder: Well?

00:11:08.361 --> 00:11:09.634
Arthur Breslauer: Beets.

00:11:09.634 --> 00:11:10.606
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:10.606 --> 00:11:19.431
Arthur Breslauer: Very rarely, potatoes. We also got an acceptable amount of butter ration.

00:11:19.431 --> 00:11:21.297
David Boder: That was margarine, of course.

00:11:21.297 --> 00:11:25.480
Arthur Breslauer: Also, half-half, margarine, but also butter.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.294
David Boder: Butter, as well. So?

00:11:27.294 --> 00:11:38.187
Arthur Breslauer: And we also got a bread portion. But the bread was very bad.

00:11:38.187 --> 00:11:40.113
David Boder: That was in which year?

00:11:40.113 --> 00:11:41.566
Arthur Breslauer: 1944.

00:11:41.566 --> 00:11:45.388
David Boder: ’44. Which months, approximately?

00:11:45.388 --> 00:11:56.019
Arthur Breslauer: We were put on the train on June 30th, and arrived in Switzerland on August 18th.

00:11:56.019 --> 00:11:59.097
David Boder: Ah, I see. So it was June 30th.

00:11:59.097 --> 00:11:59.549
Arthur Breslauer: Yes.

00:11:59.549 --> 00:12:02.567
David Boder: Then you were there only from July to August, weren’t you?

00:12:02.567 --> 00:12:07.562
Arthur Breslauer: From July, July 11th to August 18th.

00:12:07.562 --> 00:12:10.752
David Boder: Well, that wasn’t too long. Five weeks, six weeks.

00:12:10.752 --> 00:12:20.300
Arthur Breslauer: Yes, but only three hundred people were taken away. The rest stayed there until December 7th.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.422
David Boder: Well?

00:12:21.422 --> 00:12:26.478
Arthur Breslauer: Excuse me? And on December 7th, they were also brought to Switzerland.

00:12:26.478 --> 00:12:37.891
David Boder: Alright. Shall we move on? You only waited in Belsen-Belsen. And how did your daughter get sick?

00:12:37.891 --> 00:12:40.780
Arthur Breslauer: She got the measles.

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:41.601
David Boder: The older daughter.

00:12:41.601 --> 00:12:42.865
Arthur Breslauer: The older daughter.

00:12:42.865 --> 00:12:43.738
David Boder: Well, where was she, then, err...

00:12:43.738 --> 00:12:54.218
Arthur Breslauer: And since, because she, err, couldn’t be properly cared for, complications arose...

00:12:54.218 --> 00:12:55.211
David Boder: Well. The lungs.

00:12:55.211 --> 00:13:12.346
Arthur Breslauer: Hungary. There, she couldn’t be cured either, as would have been necessary. She couldn’t get the nourishment that would have to be given to a very sick person.

00:13:12.346 --> 00:13:14.753
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:14.753 --> 00:13:17.552
Arthur Breslauer: So, she...

00:13:17.552 --> 00:13:23.519
David Boder: Was she in the infirmary or with you in the quarters? With your wife in the quarters?

00:13:23.519 --> 00:13:25.153
Arthur Breslauer: With my wife in the quarters.

00:13:25.153 --> 00:13:26.998
David Boder: And she died in the quarters?

00:13:26.998 --> 00:13:28.030
Arthur Breslauer: Yes.

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:30.287
David Boder: Were you allowed to bury her?

00:13:30.287 --> 00:13:42.182
Arthur Breslauer: No, they took her away. We brought her only as far as the gate.

00:13:42.182 --> 00:14:08.393
David Boder: Well? And then? Then, in August?

00:14:08.393 --> 00:14:16.857
David Boder: Well, in August? What happened then? [pause]

00:14:16.857 --> 00:14:21.943
David Boder: Then, in August, you were brought to Switzerland. How was this announced to you?

00:14:21.943 --> 00:14:35.041
Arthur Breslauer: An “Obergruppenführer” came and told us, and then decided who would come and who would stay.

00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:36.666
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:36.666 --> 00:14:41.691
Arthur Breslauer: And, we travelled again in livestock cargo train.

00:14:41.691 --> 00:14:44.159
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:44.159 --> 00:14:46.335
Arthur Breslauer: Just like from Hungary.

00:14:46.335 --> 00:14:48.751
David Boder: But you were brought there together with your family?

00:14:48.751 --> 00:14:49.684
Arthur Breslauer: Yes.

00:14:49.684 --> 00:14:52.212
David Boder: Yes, well?

00:14:52.212 --> 00:15:00.947
Arthur Breslauer: Then, on August 21st, we arrived here in Basel.

00:15:00.947 --> 00:15:33.229
David Boder: So, can you explain this a little bit to me? In America, if I understand you correctly, we have heard very little about this group. But I already talked to a boy, who studies here in the ORT, err—his father is also in this country—who also came with such a group. I think twenty-five people were chosen from somewhere and came here with this group. Who had organized all of this?

00:15:33.229 --> 00:15:38.164
Arthur Breslauer: The Zion—, err, the Zionists had.

00:15:38.164 --> 00:15:40.060
David Boder: Which Zionists?

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:46.298
Arthur Breslauer: The Kolozsvár-Zionists had.

00:15:46.298 --> 00:15:48.293
David Boder: What is Kolozsvár?

00:15:48.293 --> 00:15:52.936
Arthur Breslauer: That’s the capital of Transylvania.

00:15:52.936 --> 00:15:54.179
David Boder: Where is that?

00:15:54.179 --> 00:15:55.181
Arthur Breslauer: Hungary.

00:15:55.181 --> 00:15:59.845
David Boder: Oh! The Zionists of Hungary had done what?

00:15:59.845 --> 00:16:07.407
Arthur Breslauer: They, this group, the so-called “Alia-[unintelligible, possibly “Waren”?]-Group”.

00:16:07.407 --> 00:16:11.719
David Boder: Oh! It was the Alía. And they put this group together?

00:16:11.719 --> 00:16:13.233
Arthur Breslauer: Yes.

00:16:13.233 --> 00:16:16.131
David Boder: Were these mostly rich people?

00:16:16.131 --> 00:16:32.720
Arthur Breslauer: No. Partly. Partly it was rich people, who had paid a lot of money, to join this group. But there were, most of them were poor.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:38.175
David Boder: How much did you have to pay?

00:16:38.175 --> 00:16:39.800
Arthur Breslauer: I...[unintelligible]

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.786
David Boder: So...but you did pay?

00:16:41.786 --> 00:16:42.990
Arthur Breslauer: Yes.

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:45.135
David Boder: Also for your family.

00:16:45.135 --> 00:16:46.399
Arthur Breslauer: [unintelligible]

00:16:46.399 --> 00:17:00.030
David Boder: So, with this money, other, poorer people could be taken with this group as well. Well. And? How did you manage the risk to trust the Germans?

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:02.467
Arthur Breslauer: We had no other choice.

00:17:02.467 --> 00:17:02.979
David Boder: I see.

00:17:02.979 --> 00:17:13.249
Arthur Breslauer: We were dead certain, that if we stay we would get...

00:17:13.249 --> 00:17:13.980
David Boder: Annihilated.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:15.394
Arthur Breslauer: Annihilated.

00:17:15.394 --> 00:17:16.026
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:16.026 --> 00:17:27.310
Arthur Breslauer: So we calculated that our chances were around ten or twenty percent...

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:33.780
David Boder: Were the Germans paid for this? Was it a bribe?

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:40.920
Arthur Breslauer: It was an agreement. This group in exchange for goods...

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:41.643
David Boder: In exchange for what?

00:17:41.643 --> 00:17:43.096
Arthur Breslauer: For goods. For goods, [they] were taken.

00:17:43.096 --> 00:17:43.337
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:43.337 --> 00:17:47.941
Arthur Breslauer: War-relevant goods. But I don’t know any details.

00:17:47.941 --> 00:17:57.428
David Boder: Yes, well? Tell me, what did the other Jews do, when they learned about the formation of this special group?

00:17:57.428 --> 00:18:14.006
Arthur Breslauer: It was, the organization wasn’t really well known. And as we, even before we left, a second group was formed.

00:18:14.006 --> 00:18:14.346
David Boder: Yes.

00:18:14.346 --> 00:18:18.438
Arthur Breslauer: With the goal to free...

00:18:18.438 --> 00:18:20.725
David Boder: To free more people in this way.

00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:21.146
Arthur Breslauer: Free more people in this way.

00:18:21.146 --> 00:18:22.892
David Boder: Did it work out?

00:18:22.892 --> 00:18:24.466
Arthur Breslauer: Unfortunately not.

00:18:24.466 --> 00:18:28.989
David Boder: So, you left, about three hundred people. They were...

00:18:28.989 --> 00:18:29.780
Arthur Breslauer: Where?

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.074
David Boder: Belsen-Belsen.

00:18:31.074 --> 00:18:31.496
Arthur Breslauer: Yes.

00:18:31.496 --> 00:18:36.319
David Boder: They were put into these livestock carriages and where were they taken? To Basel?

00:18:36.319 --> 00:18:37.252
Arthur Breslauer: To Basel.

00:18:37.252 --> 00:18:42.277
David Boder: Who received you on the Swiss border?

00:18:42.277 --> 00:18:46.069
Arthur Breslauer: In Switzerland, the, err, the Red Cross received us.

00:18:46.069 --> 00:18:47.793
David Boder: They already knew about it.

00:18:47.793 --> 00:18:50.020
Arthur Breslauer: Yes. We had been announced.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:53.820
David Boder: So, how far did the Germans go with you?

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.318
Arthur Breslauer: To the border.

00:18:56.318 --> 00:18:57.982
David Boder: Were you [frisked] there?

00:18:57.982 --> 00:19:00.248
Arthur Breslauer: Oh yes! Very thoroughly.

00:19:00.248 --> 00:19:01.762
David Boder: How?

00:19:01.762 --> 00:19:04.750
Arthur Breslauer: They rummaged through everything. Everything.

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:07.016
David Boder: Why? What did they want now?

00:19:07.016 --> 00:19:17.165
Arthur Breslauer: Papers, letters, books, valuables?

00:19:17.165 --> 00:19:20.084
David Boder: People still had valuables?

00:19:20.084 --> 00:19:23.484
Arthur Breslauer: Some might have rescued some things.

00:19:23.484 --> 00:19:29.563
David Boder: Yes. Well, and they took all that away? And then what did they do with the train?

00:19:29.563 --> 00:19:33.815
Arthur Breslauer: They cleared the train for customs and let it pass the border.

00:19:33.815 --> 00:19:35.660
David Boder: The locomotive pulled...

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:35.850
Arthur Breslauer: Yes.

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:40.673
David Boder: Pulled the train. Yes, well? And the Red Cross was already on the other side?

00:19:40.673 --> 00:19:50.633
Arthur Breslauer: They already welcomed us. The happiness that the group felt at that point is indescribable!

00:19:50.633 --> 00:19:52.379
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:52.379 --> 00:19:57.654
Arthur Breslauer: Switzerland received us very well. Right away, it...

00:19:57.654 --> 00:19:58.776
David Boder: A little louder!

00:19:58.776 --> 00:20:23.759
Arthur Breslauer: Right away, then, we were given soup and fruits; we were taken to a bathhouse. And afterwards, they accommodated us and after three days we were taken to different places in the country. We came to Montreux.

00:20:23.759 --> 00:20:29.004
David Boder: The Zionist organization, the representatives were there?

00:20:29.004 --> 00:20:31.300
Arthur Breslauer: Only those who had come with us.

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.663
David Boder: Only those who had come with you.

00:20:32.663 --> 00:20:32.753
Arthur Breslauer: Yes.

00:20:32.753 --> 00:20:35.251
David Boder: So, now Zionists from Switzerland received...

00:20:35.251 --> 00:20:37.457
Arthur Breslauer: No, they didn’t meet us then yet.

00:20:37.457 --> 00:20:38.339
David Boder: Well?

00:20:38.339 --> 00:20:46.954
Arthur Breslauer: Only later the group leaders met with the organizations.

00:20:46.954 --> 00:21:04.145
David Boder: Yes. So, you...altogether Belsen-Belsen wasn’t that bad for you, except the tragic incident with your daughter. Personally, how were you treated?

00:21:04.145 --> 00:21:08.668
Arthur Breslauer: Oh! We were treated very strictly.

00:21:08.668 --> 00:21:11.084
David Boder: Were fights rare?

00:21:11.084 --> 00:21:25.166
Arthur Breslauer: There were, err, no fights in our, our group. But next door, we saw how the people were beaten. They were Jews from Holland.

00:21:25.166 --> 00:21:25.889
David Boder: From Holland?

00:21:25.889 --> 00:21:26.590
Arthur Breslauer: Yes.

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:27.493
David Boder: Well?

00:21:27.493 --> 00:21:30.902
Arthur Breslauer: They were, they did hard...

00:21:30.902 --> 00:21:31.053
David Boder: Labor.

00:21:31.053 --> 00:21:32.567
Arthur Breslauer: Labor.

00:21:32.567 --> 00:21:33.479
David Boder: Hmm.

00:21:33.479 --> 00:21:37.279
Arthur Breslauer: And were very much abused.

00:21:37.279 --> 00:21:41.221
David Boder: Well? But that didn’t happen in your barracks?

00:21:41.221 --> 00:21:41.943
Arthur Breslauer: No.

00:21:41.943 --> 00:21:45.223
David Boder: And the Blockältester was elected by you or by the...?

00:21:45.223 --> 00:21:48.783
Arthur Breslauer: Yes, the so-called “Jewish Elder.”

00:21:48.783 --> 00:21:49.334
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:49.334 --> 00:21:51.690
Arthur Breslauer: Was...by us.

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:58.400
David Boder: Well? And then, what happened in Switzerland? What did you do then?

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:06.163
Arthur Breslauer: We then came into an “Auffangsaal” and after six weeks they...

00:22:06.163 --> 00:22:07.187
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:07.187 --> 00:22:17.607
Arthur Breslauer: Brought us to a home. And I have been here since six months and am doing the embroidery training.

00:22:17.607 --> 00:22:20.526
David Boder: I see. You’ve lived here since six months and why...[unintelligible]

00:22:20.526 --> 00:22:21.188
Arthur Breslauer: Yes.

00:22:21.188 --> 00:22:26.845
David Boder: [unintelligible] Well, as you say, you were a businessman before?

00:22:26.845 --> 00:22:27.366
Arthur Breslauer: Yes.

00:22:27.366 --> 00:22:32.129
David Boder: Didn’t you have any plans to go back to the same profession?

00:22:32.129 --> 00:22:40.946
Arthur Breslauer: Well, if I had the opportunity to emigrate, to be able to emigrate to America, I could find a job in it.

00:22:40.946 --> 00:22:42.971
David Boder: Do you have relatives there?

00:22:42.971 --> 00:22:55.218
Arthur Breslauer: Unfortunately we don’t have relatives, only acquaintances. My father-in-law—God bless him—was a very famous scholar.

00:22:55.218 --> 00:22:56.190
David Boder: Where?

00:22:56.190 --> 00:23:05.738
Arthur Breslauer: In Hungary. And he is also well known in America, and very renowned and respected.

00:23:05.738 --> 00:23:07.282
David Boder: So you do have relatives!

00:23:07.282 --> 00:23:10.240
Arthur Breslauer: Relatives, no, only acquaintances, and err...

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.355
David Boder: So, the father-in-law is already dead.

00:23:12.355 --> 00:23:14.401
Arthur Breslauer: Dead, since 10 years.

00:23:14.401 --> 00:23:21.382
David Boder: Oh! And now? What is your plan, after you’ve learned the trade? What do you want to do?

00:23:21.382 --> 00:23:24.121
Arthur Breslauer: Either to Erez.

00:23:24.121 --> 00:23:25.454
David Boder: So, to Israel...

00:23:25.454 --> 00:23:45.533
Arthur Breslauer: Yes, or, which is something I’d rather do, to America, because in America I would have better chances. I am after all an experienced businessman and experienced stock broker.

00:23:45.533 --> 00:23:49.866
David Boder: Did you not think of South America?

00:23:49.866 --> 00:23:53.252
Arthur Breslauer: If necessary. It’s not out of the question.

00:23:53.252 --> 00:24:12.128
David Boder: Because, you see, in America they don’t want, at least that’s what I think, don’t want the businessmen right away, but in South America, most of those people, most of the craftsmen who later became businessmen have established themselves very well.

00:24:12.128 --> 00:24:30.251
Arthur Breslauer: Yes indeed! After I have learned this new trade, I do not view myself only as a businessman, but also as a craftsman. And I could sustain myself very nicely with my new profession.

00:24:30.251 --> 00:24:32.719
David Boder: And what does your wife do?

00:24:32.719 --> 00:24:35.191
Arthur Breslauer: [unintelligible]

00:24:35.191 --> 00:24:37.629
David Boder: Your wife, your wife does the same job?

00:24:37.629 --> 00:24:39.374
Arthur Breslauer: My wife is also learning a new trade.

00:24:39.374 --> 00:24:40.848
David Boder: Is she here now?

00:24:40.848 --> 00:24:46.596
Arthur Breslauer: Unfortunately not, she is with the kids.

00:24:46.596 --> 00:24:48.401
David Boder: Where is the kid? Out in the country?

00:24:48.401 --> 00:24:47.386
Arthur Breslauer: Yes.
