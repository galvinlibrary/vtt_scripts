The interviewee is Mr. Abram Perl, twenty-seven years old, who has a number of aliases: Perl, Baruch, and he intends to call himself in Palestine Abram Shlomi, which is a translation of his former name, Friedman.

00:01:54.298 --> 00:02:00.873
David Boder: [In German] And so, Mr. Perl, would you come a little closer. Yes. And talk into here or here, right?

00:02:00.873 --> 00:02:01.998
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] Either here or here.

00:02:01.998 --> 00:02:06.415
David Boder: [In German] Yes, not quite so...but so that the light should go on now and then. It shows...

00:02:06.415 --> 00:02:06.883
Baruch Friedman: Yes.

00:02:06.883 --> 00:02:16.999
David Boder: . . . that you are talking properly [that the volume is all right]. Come on here. Mr. Perl, would you tell us again your name, how old you are and from where...where you were when the war began.

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:18.860
Baruch Friedman: [In German] It was...[in Yiddish] it was...

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.279
David Boder: Your name?

00:02:19.279 --> 00:00:00.776
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] My name is Friedman, Baruch.

00:00:00.776 --> 00:02:23.543
David Boder: Yes, Baruch Friedman, yes.

00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:27.808
Baruch Friedman: Yes. It is...Born on Slovakia, in Kurima.

00:02:27.808 --> 00:02:28.636
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:28.636 --> 00:02:37.011
Baruch Friedman: During the war I was....In the year ’42, when there had begun the Slovakian transports [deportations] against the Jews...

00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:39.842
David Boder: [In German] But....Wait a moment. When did war with Slovakia begin?

00:02:39.842 --> 00:02:42.819
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] Slovakia experienced no war at all.

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:43.254
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:43.254 --> 00:02:45.431
Baruch Friedman: Because she was under German occupation.

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:46.221
David Boder: Aha.

00:02:46.221 --> 00:02:50.403
Baruch Friedman: Only the Slovakian government was so influenced by the German...

00:02:50.403 --> 00:02:50.977
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:50.977 --> 00:02:59.879
Baruch Friedman: . . . that in the year ’42 began the large transports [deportations] of Jews. It was still in the beginning of April.

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:00.634
David Boder: Yes?

00:03:00.634 --> 00:03:08.125
Baruch Friedman: And there began the transportation of Jews, around seventy thousand. This lasted the entire...entire summer until about September.

00:03:08.125 --> 00:03:16.514
David Boder: [In German/Yiddish] Tell me, how were the Jews gathered together, how were they transported, what did your family do, and what happened to your family?

00:03:16.514 --> 00:03:30.844
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] Yes. And so, it was about in...about July. Even before I knew that the transports will start going, I hid with my brother in the forest.

00:03:30.844 --> 00:03:31.852
David Boder: How old were you?

00:03:31.852 --> 00:03:35.663
Baruch Friedman: I was then...that is with four...

00:03:35.663 --> 00:03:37.244
David Boder: What was it?

00:03:37.244 --> 00:03:38.790
Baruch Friedman: It was in the year ’42.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:39.342
David Boder: Yes, nu?

00:03:39.342 --> 00:03:40.184
Baruch Friedman: Yes.

00:03:40.184 --> 00:03:41.150
David Boder: How old were you?

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.425
Baruch Friedman: It is four...four years. That means twenty-three.

00:03:43.425 --> 00:03:44.890
David Boder: You were twenty-three.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:45.123
Baruch Friedman: Twenty-three years old.

00:03:45.123 --> 00:03:46.696
David Boder: Your brother was older or younger?

00:03:46.696 --> 00:03:49.672
Baruch Friedman: The other one was a younger brother by two years.

00:03:49.672 --> 00:03:52.071
David Boder: [In German] What was the occupation of your parents?

00:03:52.071 --> 00:03:55.795
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] A merchant in agriculture, in a...in...in a small village.

00:03:55.795 --> 00:03:56.698
David Boder: In a small village.

00:03:56.698 --> 00:03:57.072
Baruch Friedman: Yes.

00:03:57.072 --> 00:04:01.890
David Boder: Aha. Nu, and so, so you had hidden with your brother in the forest...

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:02.529
Baruch Friedman: In the forest.

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:03.043
David Boder: . . . before transports.

00:04:03.043 --> 00:04:03.651
Baruch Friedman: Even before the transports began.

00:04:03.651 --> 00:04:05.722
David Boder: So you did do it. And how did you hide yourself?

00:04:05.722 --> 00:04:38.612
Baruch Friedman: I had a premonition that the...the plan...Hitler’s plan was so strong that...I knew that something bad will come unto the Jews. I wanted that at least a part of the family should save itself. Because of that I said, although my parents were not too much for it, that I should hide, because they wanted...that what will happen to everybody will happen to me. But I said, ‘No. A part of the family must remain so that...at least somebody should remain [survive].’ And so I went with the brother and hid in the forest.

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:40.887
David Boder: Tell me, from a philosophical standpoint...

00:04:40.887 --> 00:04:41.463
Baruch Friedman: Yes.

00:04:41.463 --> 00:04:43.162
David Boder: . . . I am [not] talking about somebody else [in general]...

00:04:43.162 --> 00:04:43.910
Baruch Friedman: Yes.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.668
David Boder: What does it mean, ‘a part of the family should remain’?

00:04:46.668 --> 00:04:51.046
Baruch Friedman: There should remain, so to speak, a memory [a living seed] of the family.

00:04:51.046 --> 00:04:51.638
David Boder: What should remain?

00:04:51.638 --> 00:04:54.225
Baruch Friedman: What [astonished]? What does that mean?

00:04:54.225 --> 00:04:55.113
David Boder: [In German] Well yes [why?].

00:04:55.113 --> 00:05:01.543
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] Yes, it is. That there should remain at least a...a....Every family wants that there should remain a descendant of the family.

00:05:01.543 --> 00:05:02.167
David Boder: Aha.

00:05:02.167 --> 00:05:06.109
Baruch Friedman: Also from that point, I wanted it. And so at least someone should remain from our family.

00:05:06.109 --> 00:05:10.112
David Boder: Didn’t you think that if you remain with your parents you perhaps could save them?

00:05:10.112 --> 00:05:13.083
Baruch Friedman: I begged them to come. They...

00:05:13.083 --> 00:05:14.186
David Boder: Aha. You did...

00:05:14.186 --> 00:05:27.765
Baruch Friedman: I did not ask them once, many times I have asked them. But they could not conceive that all those people are led simply into...into...into the crematories. And they did not want to know it. And I have foreseen...

00:05:27.765 --> 00:05:28.296
David Boder: Aha.

00:05:28.296 --> 00:05:29.966
Baruch Friedman: . . . that it can happen.

00:05:29.966 --> 00:05:32.838
David Boder: [In German/Yiddish] And so first you asked your parents that all should go.

00:05:32.838 --> 00:05:33.338
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] All should go.

00:05:33.338 --> 00:05:34.118
David Boder: Nu, but the parents did not want to.

00:05:34.118 --> 00:05:34.806
Baruch Friedman: The parents did not want to.

00:05:34.806 --> 00:05:36.539
David Boder: [In German/Yiddish] So then you said that...

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:44.695
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] So I said, ‘At least one should go.’ So I myself...at first I went by myself. Then I dragged along the brother. I was so persistent that the brother also came.

00:05:44.695 --> 00:05:45.663
David Boder: How old was he?

00:05:45.663 --> 00:05:47.208
Baruch Friedman: He was two years younger.

00:05:47.208 --> 00:05:49.002
David Boder: So your brother was twenty-one years old?

00:05:49.002 --> 00:05:50.001
Baruch Friedman: Twenty-one years.

00:05:50.001 --> 00:05:56.151
David Boder: And so how does one go away into the forest? Tell all the details. I will tell you, Mr....Mr. Perl...

00:05:56.151 --> 00:05:56.557
Baruch Friedman: Yes.

00:05:56.557 --> 00:05:59.397
David Boder: [In German]. . . about generalities [In Yiddish] enough books had been written.

00:05:59.397 --> 00:06:00.006
Baruch Friedman: Yes, yes.

00:06:00.006 --> 00:06:03.329
David Boder: [In Yiddish/English] We want to know what happened to you personally.

00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:03.596
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] Yes.

00:06:03.596 --> 00:06:04.751
David Boder: From day to day...

00:06:04.751 --> 00:06:05.142
Baruch Friedman: Yes

00:06:05.142 --> 00:06:06.016
David Boder: . . . as one may report it [?].

00:06:06.016 --> 00:06:06.640
Baruch Friedman: Yes.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.952
David Boder: Nu.

00:06:06.952 --> 00:06:12.384
Baruch Friedman: And so this is how it was exactly. The...the...also at the beginning of...

00:06:12.384 --> 00:06:14.257
David Boder: The dates you don’t have to give.

00:06:14.257 --> 00:06:14.944
Baruch Friedman: Not the dates.

00:06:14.944 --> 00:06:15.319
David Boder: Nu?

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:29.072
Baruch Friedman: In an hour of night I decided with the brother, we are going to the forest, simply to the forest. Transports were going continuously. And so we had been hiding for a while at home. And so we are going.

00:06:29.072 --> 00:06:30.931
David Boder: [In German] And so, what does it mean, ‘transports were going’?

00:06:30.931 --> 00:06:43.332
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] Transports were going. They took...from the whole region they took Jews, masses of Jews, loaded into RR-cars, eighty to a RR-car, and sent them right away to Poland, to Majdanek, Treblinka, there in...

00:06:43.332 --> 00:06:45.164
David Boder: What happened to them there?

00:06:45.164 --> 00:06:47.534
Baruch Friedman: There, naturally, into crematories.

00:06:47.534 --> 00:06:48.081
David Boder: And so.

00:06:48.081 --> 00:06:48.628
Baruch Friedman: All.

00:06:48.628 --> 00:07:20.363
David Boder: [In English] Eh, I want to state that since Spool about number 100 we have replaced the ‘absolutely’ non-directive interview by slightly directive [methods]. That is, we are suggesting that they are talking [should talk] about the high points of their, eh...experiences. This is, of course, not exactly the best method because it has shown that if one gives them perfectly free reign, the...certain experiences come out very freely. It’s kind of a mixture [of methods], and we are experimenting with it.

00:07:20.363 --> 00:07:24.658
David Boder: [In German/Yiddish] And so tell me, how did you leave for the forest?

00:07:24.658 --> 00:07:35.809
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] I gathered the rucksack which I had ready, which every Jew had ready, and went to the forest.

00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:38.464
David Boder: Where was the forest? Where...where...

00:07:38.464 --> 00:07:43.883
Baruch Friedman: At first we were hidden in kind of a cellar [cave]. We had taken along a tent.

00:07:43.883 --> 00:07:45.508
David Boder: A tent. Who was along?

00:07:45.508 --> 00:07:46.616
Baruch Friedman: The brother and I.

00:07:46.616 --> 00:07:47.381
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:07:47.381 --> 00:07:54.034
Baruch Friedman: A tent. We put up a tent in the forest, and there under the free sky we lived. We took along food for a week’s time.

00:07:54.034 --> 00:07:54.377
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:54.377 --> 00:08:00.733
Baruch Friedman: Bread and various...canned milk and so forth. And thus we lived there temporarily, for a week.

00:08:00.733 --> 00:08:03.500
David Boder: Were there other people with you?

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.809
Baruch Friedman: No. Just I and the brother.

00:08:04.809 --> 00:08:06.543
David Boder: How far was the forest from your home?

00:08:06.543 --> 00:08:09.089
Baruch Friedman: It was around five kilometers.

00:08:09.089 --> 00:08:11.300
David Boder: Five kilometers. Did you go in at night?

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:17.820
Baruch Friedman: At night, into the forest. And there we were alone for about a week. Entirely alone without communication, without anything.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.400
David Boder: Where did you find [something] to drink?

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.974
Baruch Friedman: It is...in the forest there are various brooks. There are little springs there.

00:08:23.974 --> 00:08:24.397
David Boder: Yes.

00:08:24.397 --> 00:08:25.100
Baruch Friedman: And that is what we had.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:25.725
David Boder: Hm.

00:08:25.725 --> 00:09:03.384
Baruch Friedman: And also for washing. Later we began making connection there...with a Gentile of our acquaintance, with whom we came in closer contact...with whom...And we began making a closer connection with him. Quite close, since we began to realize that alone one cannot exist in the forest. The thing might drag on for very long, so we decided to come together a little closer with him. He took us in. He gave us there, at the beginning with difficulties, but we promised that we will give him money and various articles which were still in the house.

00:09:03.384 --> 00:09:04.821
David Boder: The mother promised him?

00:09:04.821 --> 00:09:06.727
Baruch Friedman: No, we promised him.

00:09:06.727 --> 00:09:07.039
David Boder: Yes.

00:09:07.039 --> 00:09:08.023
Baruch Friedman: We promised him.

00:09:08.023 --> 00:09:08.507
David Boder: Yes?

00:09:08.507 --> 00:09:18.708
Baruch Friedman: And thus....Then we sent a note to...there...to the parents that they should give him some things from the house, and in return he should hide us there.

00:09:18.708 --> 00:09:19.317
David Boder: Hm.

00:09:19.317 --> 00:09:28.242
Baruch Friedman: With this arrangement we asked that the parents, too, come there, to that Gentile, that they should come there, too, because now we had already some sort of place for them to hide.

00:09:28.242 --> 00:09:28.961
David Boder: Hm.

00:09:28.961 --> 00:09:33.517
Baruch Friedman: But they did not want to come. They said what will happen to all Jews shall happen to them, too.

00:09:33.517 --> 00:09:34.797
David Boder: Hm.

00:09:34.797 --> 00:09:45.076
Baruch Friedman: And thus the Gentile began to hi-...he hid us. And for a time it was...was quite comfortable.

00:09:45.076 --> 00:09:45.076
David Boder: What did you do the whole day?

00:09:45.076 --> 00:10:13.803
Baruch Friedman: The whole day we spent with Hebrew. We studied. we had taken along books and we were studying Hebrew. Even though the nerves were very tense, we knew that today we have to live like cattle. We make up our minds to think [about] nothing, even though the situation was difficult, to think nothing. Only to live. We know we have a task to live through the war here, and...and in order...I mean, so it will come to an end.

00:10:13.803 --> 00:10:17.571
David Boder: [In German/Yiddish] Nu, when one studies Hebrew one does think, one studies. What did you study [?]?

00:10:17.571 --> 00:10:24.398
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] [Words not clear.] What did we study? And so we studied Hebrew. Well, like I said, Hebrew. Tanach [abridged designation for the Old Testament].

00:10:24.398 --> 00:10:25.117
David Boder: Yes.

00:10:25.117 --> 00:10:28.257
Baruch Friedman: Just to pass the time and not to think about the present.

00:10:28.257 --> 00:10:37.527
David Boder: Aha. Tell me, how much Yiddish, how much Hebrew had you learned while you were a young man? Did you....How much did you know?

00:10:37.527 --> 00:10:46.082
Baruch Friedman: I knew little. I knew just what I had learned in Cheder, but there I learned the real Sephardic.

00:10:46.082 --> 00:10:47.425
David Boder: [In German] What does that mean?

00:10:47.425 --> 00:10:51.871
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] That means the real...I mean, the modern Hebrew, not the Jewish [word not clear]...

00:10:51.871 --> 00:10:52.425
David Boder: Aha.

00:10:52.425 --> 00:10:53.331
Baruch Friedman: . . . Loshon Hakodesh [the holy language]...

00:10:53.331 --> 00:10:53.643
David Boder: Yes.

00:10:53.643 --> 00:10:54.253
Baruch Friedman: . . . but Sephardic.

00:10:54.253 --> 00:10:55.597
David Boder: [In German/Yiddish] What is spoken as Yiddish?

00:10:55.597 --> 00:10:56.190
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] No.

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:56.987
David Boder: No? Modern Hebrew?

00:10:56.987 --> 00:10:58.282
Baruch Friedman: Modern Hebrew, yes.

00:10:58.282 --> 00:10:58.939
David Boder: [In German] One speaks...

00:10:58.939 --> 00:10:59.548
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] Yes, yes.

00:10:59.548 --> 00:11:00.469
David Boder: Nu?

00:11:00.469 --> 00:11:05.875
Baruch Friedman: We had for that a certain [amount of] preparation. Now we continued.

00:11:05.875 --> 00:11:07.657
David Boder: Were you Zionists?

00:11:07.657 --> 00:11:09.469
Baruch Friedman: Yes, we were all Zionists.

00:11:09.469 --> 00:11:11.438
David Boder: All were. The father, too?

00:11:11.438 --> 00:11:18.870
Baruch Friedman: The father was an old...I mean, from a Hassidic viewpoint....He was not for and he was not against.

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:20.604
David Boder: [In English] He was a Hassid, your father.

00:11:20.604 --> 00:11:23.307
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] Half a Hassid. Not a whole Hassid, but half a Hassid.

00:11:23.307 --> 00:11:23.713
David Boder: Nu?

00:11:23.713 --> 00:11:25.119
Baruch Friedman: Yes.

00:11:25.119 --> 00:11:26.103
David Boder: Go on.

00:11:26.103 --> 00:11:33.867
Baruch Friedman: And so then the time had come so far that....We had received information that the parents were gone.

00:11:33.867 --> 00:11:34.929
David Boder: Oh, they were taken away.

00:11:34.929 --> 00:11:46.489
Baruch Friedman: They were taken away with a transport. And now we had a still harder task. We remained helpless, because by now they were not sending from home any more gifts for that Gentile. And after that we had no more...

00:11:46.489 --> 00:11:48.125
David Boder: Who went along with the parents?

00:11:48.125 --> 00:11:50.265
Baruch Friedman: The whole town. [Words not clear.]

00:11:50.265 --> 00:11:52.662
David Boder: Yes, but you had still another brother?

00:11:52.662 --> 00:11:59.389
Baruch Friedman: Yes. I had there still two more sisters and two more brothers.

00:11:59.389 --> 00:12:01.517
David Boder: And you know anything more about your parents?

00:12:01.517 --> 00:12:23.667
Baruch Friedman: Nothing. Not a....I know that much, that they had arrived at Majdanek. Afterwards I still had a certain contact, not with them, but through a Rabbi Freeder [?], the chairman of the Slovak...Slovakian Rabbinat [ College of Rabbis], and he informed me that they perished, in fact [in] about September, October, in Majdanek.

00:12:23.667 --> 00:12:24.979
David Boder: [In German/Yiddish] And the brothers?

00:12:24.979 --> 00:12:26.697
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] Too. Everybody, everybody, also.

00:12:26.697 --> 00:12:28.947
David Boder: Hm. And so?

00:12:28.947 --> 00:12:49.241
Baruch Friedman: After that...so far...it was already....Thus I sat there by that Gentile till around February, ’43. For material and financial reasons I had to get away from there. I could not pay him any more, so I had reported voluntarily to a Slovakian labor lager....

00:12:49.241 --> 00:12:49.897
David Boder: Hm.

00:12:49.897 --> 00:12:59.213
Baruch Friedman: . . . because the Slovakian labor lagers were not being transported any more. They remained....That means, in the year ’43 Jews from Slovakia were not being transported any more.

00:12:59.213 --> 00:12:59.697
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:59.697 --> 00:13:04.134
Baruch Friedman: But Slovakian Jews remained in Slovakian labor lagers.

00:13:04.134 --> 00:13:06.294
David Boder: So in which year were they transporting?

00:13:06.294 --> 00:13:07.680
Baruch Friedman: In the year ’42.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.055
David Boder: How do you explain it that they stopped?

00:13:10.055 --> 00:13:23.616
Baruch Friedman: They stopped it....First of all, there were no more Jews. There were only....Seventy thousand Jews had left and the rest had remained because of protection [graft], because it was possible to buy off with money the Slovakian government.

00:13:23.616 --> 00:13:25.225
David Boder: How many do you estimate did remain?

00:13:25.225 --> 00:13:28.131
Baruch Friedman: There had remained about fifteen thousand Jews.

00:13:28.131 --> 00:13:34.068
David Boder: You mean to say that...you mean to say that Czechoslovakia did not have more than a hundred thousand Jews?

00:13:34.068 --> 00:13:41.480
Baruch Friedman: No. It is just the Slovakian government, just Slovakia. Because Slov-...Czechia was a protectorate.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.123
David Boder: Aha.

00:13:42.123 --> 00:13:45.430
Baruch Friedman: This was Slovakia only.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:46.698
David Boder: Aha. Not the Sudeten.

00:13:46.698 --> 00:13:47.833
Baruch Friedman: No, no, no, no.

00:13:47.833 --> 00:13:48.240
David Boder: Aha.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.333
Baruch Friedman: This was not Sudeten[?].

00:13:49.333 --> 00:13:50.176
David Boder: And so?

00:13:50.176 --> 00:13:54.395
Baruch Friedman: Yes. So I came, together with the brother...

00:13:54.395 --> 00:14:22.252
David Boder: [In English] One moment. This concludes Spool 107. We really should have started a new spool. We are going over now to the new one, and we will splice the ten minutes of Spool 107 to 108 eventually. Illinois Institute of Technology wire recording taken at Tradate, bewteen Como and Milano in Italy on September 2nd, 1946. Abram [ends abruptly]...

00:14:22.252 --> 00:14:54.452
David Boder: Italy, September the 2nd, 1946. Tradate, a community place for the Kibbutzim, displaced young persons, men and women, who strive by all means, legal or illegal, to achieve their goal, and that is to locate themselves in Palestine. The, eh...person reporting is Abram Perl, [age] twenty-seven, from Czechoslovakia, who eh...is here in one of the Kibbutzim.

00:14:54.452 --> 00:14:56.232
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] Later on I arrived...

00:14:56.232 --> 00:15:09.024
David Boder: [In German/Yiddish] And so, Mr. Perl, you told me that you had reported to that voluntary, Czechoslovakian labor lager. What was that Slovakian labor lager. because around ’43 they stopped sending transports...

00:15:09.024 --> 00:15:09.224
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] Transports.

00:15:09.224 --> 00:15:16.217
David Boder: . . . that is, [they stopped] sending people to Treblinka, to Majdanek, from Slovakia...from Slovakia...

00:15:16.217 --> 00:15:17.623
Baruch Friedman: Slovakia.

00:15:17.623 --> 00:15:22.341
David Boder: And you told that there had remained altogether about fifteen, twenty thousand Jews...

00:15:22.341 --> 00:15:22.747
Baruch Friedman: Yes.

00:15:22.747 --> 00:15:33.183
David Boder: . . . out of the hundred thousand in Slovakia, and these were mostly rich people who had connections and money. And in another sense they were who? People who had hidden themselves.

00:15:33.183 --> 00:15:33.714
Baruch Friedman: Yes.

00:15:33.714 --> 00:15:34.870
David Boder: [In German] Yes. Nu, go on.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:51.649
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] And so I arrived on the 3rd of February, ’44...’43. I arrived in Lager
                        Vyhne. This is in Slovakia. Together with the brother with whom I had been hidden.

00:15:51.649 --> 00:15:52.875
David Boder: And the family was already deported?

00:15:52.875 --> 00:15:56.914
Baruch Friedman: And the family had...had already been exterminated a long time ago.

00:15:56.914 --> 00:15:59.882
David Boder: And that was our father, your mother, and...

00:15:59.882 --> 00:16:01.648
Baruch Friedman: And the siblings. All the siblings.

00:16:01.648 --> 00:16:01.898
David Boder: How many?

00:16:01.898 --> 00:16:09.490
Baruch Friedman: We had been about fifteen. The brother...one brother was already married and with children. And so out of a family of fifteen persons we two had remained.

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:13.079
David Boder: Did you later return...Have you tried to look for them later?

00:16:13.079 --> 00:16:27.769
Baruch Friedman: Yes. As I have mentioned, through a certain Rabbi Freeder, the chairman of...of [the community or Rabbinat of] Slovakia at that time, and he tried much. Someone said they are in Sobibor, but all had already been exterminated. Almost all. All.

00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:29.206
David Boder: Nu?

00:16:29.206 --> 00:16:29.925
Baruch Friedman: And so...

00:16:29.925 --> 00:16:32.144
David Boder: You said ‘almost’ all. Have you found anybody?

00:16:32.144 --> 00:16:37.213
Baruch Friedman: Some were still looking...not now, but...some had died there afterwards.

00:16:37.213 --> 00:16:37.504
David Boder: Aha.

00:16:37.504 --> 00:16:38.068
Baruch Friedman: It is...it is...

00:16:38.068 --> 00:16:38.560
David Boder: [In German] Nu, yes.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:44.783
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] It is...it is....This is now immaterial [?]. And so now I have...we arrived there in Lager
                        Vyhne.

00:16:44.783 --> 00:16:45.861
David Boder: Who is we?

00:16:45.861 --> 00:16:47.361
Baruch Friedman: I and the brother.

00:16:47.361 --> 00:16:47.830
David Boder: Yes.

00:16:47.830 --> 00:17:00.110
Baruch Friedman: We lived there pretty well in the beginning. We worked a little, And...and the Slovakian Jews who were on the outside [of the lager] supported us, so that living was quite good.

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:02.636
David Boder: Was it a Jewish lager?

00:17:02.636 --> 00:17:05.987
Baruch Friedman: A purely Jewish lager but under Gentile management.

00:17:05.987 --> 00:17:06.343
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:06.343 --> 00:17:06.787
Baruch Friedman: Under Slovakian management.

00:17:06.787 --> 00:17:08.516
David Boder: How many people, Jews, were there?

00:17:08.516 --> 00:17:09.670
Baruch Friedman: About three hundred.

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:11.372
David Boder: How did you live there?

00:17:11.372 --> 00:17:16.197
Baruch Friedman: We, boys, lived five boys in one room. Then...

00:17:16.197 --> 00:17:17.798
David Boder: Where [how come] did you get a room? What was that?

00:17:17.798 --> 00:17:22.488
Baruch Friedman: It was a former hotel, a...a...spa...a watering place it is...

00:17:22.488 --> 00:17:23.570
David Boder: [In English] Yes. [In German/Yiddish] A health resort.

00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:24.789
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] Health resort Vyhne, yes.

00:17:24.789 --> 00:17:25.320
David Boder: Yes?

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:30.413
Baruch Friedman: And out of that lager was made, and we lived there rather well. There were beds...

00:17:30.413 --> 00:17:32.538
David Boder: Hm.

00:17:32.538 --> 00:17:34.522
Baruch Friedman: . . . and decent...blankets still. Not like a lager in Auschwitz, no.

00:17:34.522 --> 00:17:35.584
David Boder: Nu?

00:17:35.584 --> 00:17:45.698
Baruch Friedman: I only want to bring out this. Seeing that that whole area is surrounded by tall mountains, the entire area is mountainous...with...

00:17:45.698 --> 00:17:46.644
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:46.644 --> 00:17:57.305
Baruch Friedman: . . . so we began looking for a contact with the partisans. And we talked over the possibilities in case some day the transports will start moving again, so we should be sure of not going to Auschwitz or Treblinka.

00:17:57.305 --> 00:18:01.659
David Boder: [In German/Yiddish] Now tell me a little about the partisans. Did you...did you later go over to them?

00:18:01.659 --> 00:18:02.181
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] Later we...

00:18:02.181 --> 00:18:03.955
David Boder: Well, we will come to it later. We will come to it.

00:18:03.955 --> 00:18:12.994
Baruch Friedman: At the beginning we made our own plans. We went into the woods, made undergraound bunkers with...[we] procured weapons.

00:18:12.994 --> 00:18:15.470
David Boder: How could you go into the woods? Were you allowed to leave the lager?

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:31.765
Baruch Friedman: We would go...it was not far from the forest. And sometimes on a Sunday, when we did not work, we would tear ourselves away. We tried various possibilities...employed...in order to save our lives because it will [could] come again to a transportation!

00:18:31.765 --> 00:18:32.328
David Boder: Hm.

00:18:32.328 --> 00:18:34.827
Baruch Friedman: Now it was...

00:18:34.827 --> 00:18:35.967
David Boder: What did you work at there?

00:18:35.967 --> 00:18:39.547
Baruch Friedman: People worked there mostly at trades.

00:18:39.547 --> 00:18:40.530
David Boder: What did you do?

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:47.853
Baruch Friedman: I am by trade a letter painter and sign painter. So I worked at painting. There was a production of toys.

00:18:47.853 --> 00:18:48.524
David Boder: Aha.

00:18:48.524 --> 00:18:49.711
Baruch Friedman: Toy production.

00:18:49.711 --> 00:18:50.071
David Boder: Yes?

00:18:50.071 --> 00:18:54.970
Baruch Friedman: Yes. So I worked there at it. It was not bad. I cannot say that it was bad all the time.

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:55.407
David Boder: Nu, go on.

00:18:55.407 --> 00:18:58.292
Baruch Friedman: This happend [?]...

00:18:58.292 --> 00:18:59.460
David Boder: This was under the Slovaks.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:00.282
Baruch Friedman: Under the Slovaks, yes.

00:19:00.282 --> 00:19:00.592
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:00.592 --> 00:19:09.235
Baruch Friedman: The Germans had absolutely no access there. They were only...the Slovaks were only influenced by the Germans, but they were not that bad.

00:19:09.235 --> 00:19:09.564
David Boder: Nu?

00:19:09.564 --> 00:19:17.500
Baruch Friedman: Now we...yes, and so, this....Thus we had been living till the 25th of August, ’44.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:18.500
David Boder: Hm.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:33.096
Baruch Friedman: Then had...yes, then we already had a contact with the partisans, and we already had our own weapons, pistols. So that if it should come to a transport we were organized to offer resistance.

00:19:33.096 --> 00:19:35.654
David Boder: Aha. And those partisans were Jews or Christians?

00:19:35.654 --> 00:19:38.499
Baruch Friedman: No, the partisans were mostly Russians.

00:19:38.499 --> 00:19:39.654
David Boder: Oh. Russian partisans?

00:19:39.654 --> 00:19:42.587
Baruch Friedman: Russian partisans who had crossed over to Slovakia.

00:19:42.587 --> 00:19:43.197
David Boder: Aha.

00:19:43.197 --> 00:20:08.560
Baruch Friedman: And with them we came into contact, with the one who had the main contact through Bratislava. And with him we were in contact. And so there came the 25th of August. The Slovakian uprising was organized. There came a host of partisans and liberated us, the whole lager, that is in connection with the uprising.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.286
David Boder: In ’44.

00:20:09.286 --> 00:20:29.333
Baruch Friedman: In the year ’44, in August. And they took us right away...everyone free, that means everyone was released. One could go wherever one wanted. And many of our youngsters voluntarily joined the fight against the Germans. The Germans put up many divisions against that. He made...that brought about the occupation of Slovakia by the Germans.

00:20:29.333 --> 00:20:29.894
David Boder: Yes?

00:20:29.894 --> 00:20:42.714
Baruch Friedman: And, yes, and after the...the...the Jews have...large contingents of Jews who had come together, not only from our lager, also from Lager
                        Novaki...

00:20:42.714 --> 00:20:43.182
David Boder: Hm

00:20:43.182 --> 00:20:55.106
Baruch Friedman: There were hundreds of Jews, four, five hundreds of Jews got together, and we went against the thrust of the Germans, and also of the Slovaks who were...sided with...Tisa...

00:20:55.106 --> 00:20:55.490
David Boder: The Germans.

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:57.626
Baruch Friedman: With the Tisa and Tuka government.

00:20:57.626 --> 00:20:57.827
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:57.827 --> 03:07:38.325
Baruch Friedman: And so...

03:07:38.325 --> 00:20:58.885
David Boder: One moment.

00:20:58.885 --> 00:20:59.352
Baruch Friedman: Yes.

00:20:59.352 --> 00:21:02.187
David Boder: [In German/Yiddish] That happened on the 25th of August?

00:21:02.187 --> 00:21:04.851
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] August. At that time came the...the thrust.

00:21:04.851 --> 00:21:05.567
David Boder: And so...

00:21:05.567 --> 00:21:05.956
Baruch Friedman: Yes.

00:21:05.956 --> 00:21:15.764
David Boder: Would you describe to me, from the 24th to the 26th of August, everything that happened there in all the details, from the [word not clear].

00:21:15.764 --> 00:21:16.237
Baruch Friedman: Yes.

00:21:16.237 --> 00:21:18.722
David Boder: Nu?

00:21:18.722 --> 00:21:20.968
Baruch Friedman: The...that means from the crucial [?] moment when [words not clear].

00:21:20.968 --> 00:21:22.265
David Boder: Everything, everything, everything.

00:21:22.265 --> 00:21:22.958
Baruch Friedman: Yes.

00:21:22.958 --> 00:21:25.053
David Boder: What did you do on that morning? What happened there?

00:21:25.053 --> 00:21:38.124
Baruch Friedman: Happened. Well, so I will begin with a day earlier. On the 23rd of August I was in Bratislava. I was to bring various pistols and munitions from Bratislava.

00:21:38.124 --> 00:21:40.333
David Boder: Were you there legally?

00:21:40.333 --> 00:21:45.186
Baruch Friedman: Yes. I had received a permit from...from the leader of the lager...

00:21:45.186 --> 00:21:45.623
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:45.623 --> 00:21:48.586
Baruch Friedman: . . . but for a different reason. He did not know what the reason was.

00:21:48.586 --> 00:21:50.606
David Boder: [In German/Yiddish] Yes. What reason did you give him?

00:21:50.606 --> 00:21:55.635
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] I declared [the purpose of] shopping, to shop for caps and so forth. For commercial reasons.

00:21:55.635 --> 00:21:56.291
David Boder: Hm.

00:21:56.291 --> 00:21:57.572
Baruch Friedman: And so far we could receive permits.

00:21:57.572 --> 00:22:00.623
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:00.623 --> 00:22:02.194
Baruch Friedman: Where was I?

00:22:02.194 --> 00:22:03.927
David Boder: And so you were in Bratislava...

00:22:03.927 --> 00:22:04.114
Baruch Friedman: Yes.

00:22:04.114 --> 00:22:04.292
David Boder: . . . on the 23rd of August.

00:22:04.292 --> 00:22:52.880
Baruch Friedman: Yes. During my journey home [back], I had heard in the meantime that the German is occupying Slovakia. Now I did not know whether I should return to the lager, or not to return. What if I return to the lager [and] the German arrives there too? I was in an undecided ‘mood’ of mind. I did not know what to do. I came to the conclusion, I have there a brother and I must go to him. And what will happen further I do not know. And on the train still I had heard that the Slovaks were rendering resistance. And coming as far as the lager at night, it was around twelve o’clock, the whole lager is awake. No one sleeps, and there is a stirring mood.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:53.588
David Boder: [In German] An excitement.

00:22:53.588 --> 00:22:54.432
Baruch Friedman: Excitement.

00:22:54.432 --> 00:22:55.088
David Boder: [In Yiddish] Yes.

00:22:55.088 --> 00:24:30.599
Baruch Friedman: And we were waiting. What was to happen? Some said, ‘Kaput. It is already kaput [the bitter end]. Our lives are already lost.’ Some still had a little hope because we thought that we shall offer resistance, or that we will decide to join the partisans. But something different was happening here. The uprising which had been organized so that the whole of Slovakia should be liberated had partly succeeded. That means in the region of Banska-Bystrica. There came all the partisans who had been organized from before, together with Russians, and they have disarmed the troops of the surrounding region, and...and...and after, generally there surrendered one garrison after another, of the towns. In Banska-Bystrica they captured the radio station and announced that there is a free Czechoslovakia. This was on about the 24th. On the 25th again there came partisans from all those groups to our lager, Vyhne, and liberated us, too. And they took immediately a part of the entire youth on a forced march. That means for occupation and for the forward push against the other part of Slovakia who sided with the Germans. To fight against them. [Pause.]

00:24:30.599 --> 00:24:31.476
David Boder: Nu, go on.

00:24:31.476 --> 00:24:44.412
Baruch Friedman: Yes. Now there was the...the....We again have...the brother and I did not join at first. We thought there is still time. We do not know yet. Maybe there will come a more difficult moment.

00:24:44.412 --> 00:24:45.629
David Boder: Where did you remain?

00:24:45.629 --> 00:24:49.331
Baruch Friedman: We left then for Zwolen, to live there in the town.

00:24:49.331 --> 00:24:50.331
David Boder: Yes.

00:24:50.331 --> 00:25:03.125
Baruch Friedman: Hundreds of youths fell as burned offering for the reason that they threw themselves straight into the fire in the fight against the...against the...against the Germans, and against the Hlinkawites who were also fighting...

00:25:03.125 --> 00:25:04.624
David Boder: What do you call the, Glinkvites?

00:25:04.624 --> 00:25:11.477
Baruch Friedman: Hlinkavites. It was the Hlinka party which fought against Czechoslovakia.

00:25:11.477 --> 00:25:12.355
David Boder: Linka?

00:25:12.355 --> 00:25:14.479
Baruch Friedman: Hlinka. Andrei Hlinka.

00:25:14.479 --> 00:25:15.885
David Boder: Linka. How do you spell it?

00:25:15.885 --> 00:25:18.915
Baruch Friedman: H-L-I-N-K-A.

00:25:18.915 --> 00:25:23.335
David Boder: That Hlinka was, so to say, a...a traitor?

00:25:23.335 --> 00:25:25.551
Baruch Friedman: He was the traitor to Czechoslovakia, yes.

00:25:25.551 --> 00:25:26.177
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:26.177 --> 00:25:30.715
Baruch Friedman: And later they went in his spirit. That means an independent Slovakian government [the statement is, of course, somewhat confused. D.P.B.]

00:25:30.715 --> 00:25:31.589
David Boder: Hm.

00:25:31.589 --> 00:25:32.354
Baruch Friedman: Yes.

00:25:32.354 --> 00:25:35.942
David Boder: And the youngsters were killed because they were on his, on Hlinka’s, side?

00:25:35.942 --> 00:25:40.724
Baruch Friedman: No. They were on our side. They fought against them. They were not trained.

00:25:40.724 --> 00:25:41.089
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:41.089 --> 00:25:49.620
Baruch Friedman: They just received a weapon in the hand and nothing...They were hardly shown how to shoot. They were not trained. So they all fell like flies. A very great number.

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:53.143
David Boder: And so you think they fell like flies because they had had no training.

00:25:53.143 --> 00:26:28.367
Baruch Friedman: No training, real training. While they were in the lager there were no possibilities for proper training. And the Slovaks themselves, a part [of them] did a lot of betraying in that uprising. In Pressburg, for instance, the bridge was supposed to have been blown up and because of that [failure to do so] the uprising did not succeed. In...in Preskow again, in eastern Slovakia, the uprising did not succeed either, also because of the treachery of the Slovaks. So that the center remained just in...in the area of Banska-Bystrica. And the terrain [he uses the Hebrew term] was a small one, and it was difficult to keep in the open.

00:26:28.367 --> 00:26:29.616
David Boder: What is a small one?

00:26:29.616 --> 00:26:31.287
Baruch Friedman: The terrain...the space.

00:26:31.287 --> 00:26:31.693
David Boder: Yes.

00:26:31.693 --> 00:26:32.144
Baruch Friedman: A small terrain.

00:26:32.144 --> 00:26:33.550
David Boder: The land was...

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:37.862
Baruch Friedman: The land...the land in which we could...in which the rebels could operate.

00:26:37.862 --> 00:26:38.674
David Boder: Hm.

00:26:38.674 --> 00:26:46.231
Baruch Friedman: So that there...there was again a painful situation. And with every week...

00:26:46.231 --> 00:26:48.112
David Boder: By ‘space’ you mean the piece [In English] of land.

00:26:48.112 --> 00:26:49.080
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] Yes, yes, yes, that is what I mean.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.215
David Boder: Yes.

00:26:50.215 --> 00:27:27.501
Baruch Friedman: The piece of the land. Yes. And now the Germans drew away troops from the east, from the far east in order to crush the uprising, because the uprising as a whole lasted about two months. And now is...We still did not know what to do. And so anyway, I and the brother decided to join the army and...and we enter...in Zwolen we, too, joined the 20th regiment. Now we fought simply the way we could fight. The...the brother really fell there, one of them.

00:27:27.501 --> 00:27:28.220
David Boder: Yes?

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:28.621
Baruch Friedman: Yes.

00:27:28.621 --> 00:27:29.334
David Boder: Which one?

00:27:29.334 --> 00:27:31.598
Baruch Friedman: That...that...my younger brother who...

00:27:31.598 --> 00:27:32.541
David Boder: Who was with you in the forest.

00:27:32.541 --> 00:28:30.964
Baruch Friedman: With me together. He fell. Yes. And I did not know what to do. And so I saw the...the Slovaks do not fight for themselves. They just want to send them, so that Jewish blood is spilled. And they themselves....And the great anti-Semitism was present. So I was of the opinion [that] I should not fight. What shall I fight for. I see that the anti-Semitism is as it was. And so what did I do? I saw that more and more the uprising is failing and failing. Within two months the...the entire uprising went completely to naught. So that people, those Jews who had concentrated there from all the corners of Slovakia, who had wanted to save themselves there, remained helpless and did not know what to do. What everybody did I did too. I still had arms, so we went into the forest and began a...a partisan life.

00:28:30.964 --> 00:28:31.846
David Boder: How many people?

00:28:31.846 --> 00:28:36.563
Baruch Friedman: We went in...we went in around fifty Jews...

00:28:36.563 --> 00:28:36.922
David Boder: Yes?

00:28:36.922 --> 00:28:38.806
Baruch Friedman: . . . and around thirty Gentiles.

00:28:38.806 --> 00:28:39.368
David Boder: Yes.

00:28:39.368 --> 00:28:44.306
Baruch Friedman: And we formed a group of eighty persons, organized, with weapons.

00:28:44.306 --> 00:28:48.587
David Boder: Yes. And who was the commander?

00:28:48.587 --> 00:28:54.306
Baruch Friedman: The commander was a...a...not a Jew, a Gentile.

00:28:54.306 --> 00:28:54.962
David Boder: Yes.

00:28:54.962 --> 00:28:57.555
Baruch Friedman: A certain Mayer. Lieutenant Mayer.

00:28:57.555 --> 00:28:58.011
David Boder: Yes?

00:28:58.011 --> 00:29:01.790
Baruch Friedman: He was in command of us. [Pause.] Yes.

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:04.212
David Boder: Did you know that he was loyal, that he was honest?

00:29:04.212 --> 00:29:14.618
Baruch Friedman: As long as he was going to hide with us we figured that we can trust him. Were he a traitor, I think he would not have gone to hide.

00:29:14.618 --> 00:29:16.181
David Boder: And how did it show up later?

00:29:16.181 --> 00:29:18.353
Baruch Friedman: That he really was, indeed straight.

00:29:18.353 --> 00:29:18.712
David Boder: Yes.

00:29:18.712 --> 00:29:48.739
Baruch Friedman: Yes. And so...I also want to mention here, after that come...again began large transports. The German had come and occupied...occupied the whole of Slovakia. And the transports which had...again started to go. Of that part, of the fifteen thousand Jews who had remained, he dragged out another ten and sent again...in the year ’44, in...in Septem-...around the time of October...

00:29:48.739 --> 00:29:49.770
David Boder: Another ten thousand?

00:29:49.770 --> 00:30:00.129
Baruch Friedman: Another ten thousand. He sent these, too, to Auschwitz, who, too....Of them a part did remain alive. Because at that time the crematories were already a little weaker.

00:30:00.129 --> 00:30:01.238
David Boder: In what year was that?

00:30:01.238 --> 00:30:02.723
Baruch Friedman: It was in the year ’44.

00:30:02.723 --> 00:30:03.551
David Boder: [In German] Towards the end.

00:30:03.551 --> 00:30:05.238
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] Towards the end of the year ’44, yes.

00:30:05.238 --> 00:30:07.217
David Boder: Yes. [Testing the microphone by tapping.]

00:30:07.217 --> 00:30:07.533
Baruch Friedman: Yes.

00:30:07.533 --> 00:30:07.794
David Boder: Nu?

00:30:07.794 --> 00:31:29.676
Baruch Friedman: And so in...in...this is....We had come to that forest around the time of November. And it began to snow. At first it was little. We did not know what we should do. We began making preparations. We made holes for ourselves, underground. Bunkers guarded on all four sides...with weapons, and there we settled. [We] picked out a suitable point so that when the German comes we should be able to attack him and save our lives through...at least through arms. I mean to offer resistance. Thus we were living. Some...many times it happened [that] there had passed a German patrol...patrol which noticed us. What did we do? And so immediately alarm was sounded. [We] surrounded them and immediately shot them all. The German eventually knew that there are still partisans there. For many months after he constantly, constantly searched all the woods that were there. But he did not trust himself to go directly in. He knew that a lot of partisans can fall upon him suddenly and do a lot of damage to him.

00:31:29.676 --> 00:31:31.988
David Boder: Then how did they search the woods?

00:31:31.988 --> 00:31:35.495
Baruch Friedman: They search[ed] all over the woods. Patrols of Germans were passing through...

00:31:35.495 --> 00:31:36.073
David Boder: Yes?

00:31:36.073 --> 00:31:38.229
Baruch Friedman: . . . and simply searched all over.

00:31:38.229 --> 00:31:39.439
David Boder: And did you see it?

00:31:39.439 --> 00:31:40.683
Baruch Friedman: We noticed it ourselves.

00:31:40.683 --> 00:31:41.199
David Boder: Yes.

00:31:41.199 --> 00:31:46.855
Baruch Friedman: Yes. But many times, as I said, a patrol would come close to us, too. So we had to surround them and shoot them all.

00:31:46.855 --> 00:31:50.199
David Boder: Did they not try to beg you not to shoot them?

00:31:50.199 --> 00:31:52.292
Baruch Friedman: We challenged them: ‘Hands up.’

00:31:52.292 --> 00:31:53.105
David Boder: Nu?

00:31:53.105 --> 00:31:55.246
Baruch Friedman: And they did not want to surrender.

00:31:55.246 --> 00:31:55.778
David Boder: Yes?

00:31:55.778 --> 00:32:04.903
Baruch Friedman: They did not want to surrender. They began...then we...because we knew the type of the German. The German knew well that if he falls into the hands of a partisan, he is dead.

00:32:04.903 --> 00:32:05.434
David Boder: Nu?

00:32:05.434 --> 00:32:12.793
Baruch Friedman: So that they fought for life and death. They did not want to surrender because they knew that if they fell into our hands they are kaput [done for].

00:32:12.793 --> 00:32:14.692
David Boder: Nu?

00:32:14.692 --> 00:32:17.470
Baruch Friedman: And...yes. So....We were living...

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:20.415
David Boder: Nu, if they would surrender, what would you have done?

00:32:20.415 --> 00:32:22.290
Baruch Friedman: [Hesitating] I do not know.

00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:23.013
David Boder: You do not know. It did not...

00:32:23.013 --> 00:32:23.263
Baruch Friedman: I do not know.

00:32:23.263 --> 00:32:23.571
David Boder: . . . happen?

00:32:23.571 --> 00:32:24.618
Baruch Friedman: It did not happen.

00:32:24.618 --> 00:32:25.430
David Boder: Yes.

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:37.173
Baruch Friedman: There were many cases [in which] they were...that...that Germans were captured. That, let us say, a group of ten people were captured, not by our group, by other groups.

00:32:37.173 --> 00:32:37.621
David Boder: Yes?

00:32:37.621 --> 00:32:41.382
Baruch Friedman: So nine were ex-...killed...

00:32:41.382 --> 00:32:41.751
David Boder: Yes.

00:32:41.751 --> 00:32:55.409
Baruch Friedman: . . . but with a brutal death, and one was released so that he should see how brutally they had been killed, and he should be able to tell his remaining comrades how they...what ugly deaths they had died.

00:32:55.409 --> 00:32:57.284
David Boder: What do you call a ‘brutal death’?

00:32:57.284 --> 00:33:08.395
Baruch Friedman: For instance, to take...a man was taken and a nail was driven between the two eyes while still alive.

00:33:08.395 --> 00:33:08.893
David Boder: Nu?

00:33:08.893 --> 00:33:13.270
Baruch Friedman: And...or other ugly, brutal deaths.

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:13.727
David Boder: Hm.

00:33:13.727 --> 00:33:20.580
Baruch Friedman: They were all tormented. Because of that they were very much afraid to get...to fall into partisan hands.

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:21.705
David Boder: Hm.

00:33:21.705 --> 00:34:28.741
Baruch Friedman: Eating. That means we lived on that, that, that every night, or every second night, we went around into the villages there, into the neighboring villages, which the Germ-...there, into those villages in which the Germans did not trust themselves to enter because they knew that there they may be attacked by the local partisans. And the population received us very well. They gave us [something] to eat and to drink, and meat, and to wash, and sometimes we would even risk staying overnight, too. And it is not...the population was not too bad because they knew that it is also in their interest, because there were many Gentiles, too, not only Jews. Thus we lived on a pretty long time, until there happened once an event. The Russians were approaching. The front was very close. This was already in the year ’45, around January.

00:34:28.741 --> 00:34:29.358
David Boder: Nu.

00:34:29.358 --> 00:35:06.878
Baruch Friedman: And we were waiting for the Russians to come and liberate us. Finished. But now it happened [that] the Russians had stopped in Brezno-on-Rona [?], twenty kilometers from us, and did not move forward. We did not know what to do. The front there was a very difficult one. The German patrons were constantly passing and walking about. They sensed already that there are partisans. They knew it. Occasionally they used mortars [?] on us. And...and they did not know....We were in a very difficult position.

00:35:06.878 --> 00:35:09.300
David Boder: [In German/Yiddish] How many partisans were there now?

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.596
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] About eighty.

00:35:10.596 --> 00:35:11.065
David Boder: Eighty.

00:35:11.065 --> 00:35:11.458
Baruch Friedman: Fifty Jews...

00:35:11.458 --> 00:35:13.221
David Boder: Did you communicate with the Russians?

00:35:13.221 --> 00:35:14.486
Baruch Friedman: Later.

00:35:14.486 --> 00:35:15.017
David Boder: Aha.

00:35:15.017 --> 00:35:29.199
Baruch Friedman: Then we went....It had happened that a German patrol, a strong patrol which was close to the front, had passed by and noticed us. And now it had happened that we had not surrounded them.

00:35:29.199 --> 00:35:29.777
David Boder: Hm.

00:35:29.777 --> 00:35:39.197
Baruch Friedman: But what then? We had shot at them, and the majority had run away.

00:35:39.197 --> 00:35:46.978
David Boder: [In German/Yiddish] Now then, would you describe it to me? You were eighty people. What armaments, what sort of weapons did you have?

00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:51.806
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] Yes. The weapons were mostly automatics. The rest...

00:35:51.806 --> 00:35:53.087
David Boder: Automatic pistols.?

00:35:53.087 --> 00:35:55.717
Baruch Friedman: Automatic pistols. Russian ones.

00:35:55.717 --> 00:35:56.309
David Boder: Yes.

00:35:56.309 --> 00:35:56.873
Baruch Friedman: Russian ones.

00:35:56.873 --> 00:35:58.352
David Boder: [In German/Yiddish] Those had been received from the Russians.

00:35:58.352 --> 00:36:01.833
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] Yes. By the uprising. The Russians had supported the uprising...

00:36:01.833 --> 00:36:02.168
David Boder: Yes.

00:36:02.168 --> 00:36:19.034
Baruch Friedman: . . . at that time. And gre-...handgrenades. And there were also about six machine guns, light machine guns. And one heavy...heavy machine gun which could not be used readily, because it was heavy to carry.

00:36:19.034 --> 00:36:19.502
David Boder: Yes?

00:36:19.502 --> 00:36:22.946
Baruch Friedman: Mostly we used just the light machine guns. Yes.

00:36:22.946 --> 00:36:24.789
David Boder: And where did one get ammunition?

00:36:24.789 --> 00:36:27.792
Baruch Friedman: Ammunition we still had from the uprising. Everything from the uprising.

00:36:27.792 --> 00:36:35.258
David Boder: And so what did happen then? Let us go back to the uprising. Who had started the uprising? Did the Russians come in?

00:36:35.258 --> 00:36:45.011
Baruch Friedman: No. Those were Russian partisans or they had supported it. Officially it was organized as a Slovakian uprising.

00:36:45.011 --> 00:36:46.631
David Boder: Yes? Aha.

00:36:46.631 --> 00:36:47.986
Baruch Friedman: But it did not succeed.

00:36:47.986 --> 00:36:47.986
David Boder: Yes.

00:36:47.986 --> 00:36:53.190
Baruch Friedman: There had been a great betrayal. And afterwards it was crushed. The German arrived and crushed the uprising.

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:57.179
David Boder: But during the uprising you partisans, you were set free from the lager...

00:36:57.179 --> 00:36:57.756
Baruch Friedman: Yes.

00:36:57.756 --> 00:36:58.877
David Boder: . . . and you took along weapons.

00:36:58.877 --> 00:37:01.152
Baruch Friedman: Took along weapons. We joined the uprising. Yes.

00:37:01.152 --> 00:37:02.539
David Boder: Nu, go on.

00:37:02.539 --> 00:37:09.676
Baruch Friedman: Yes. I want to come now to how we went over to the Russians.

00:37:09.676 --> 00:37:10.190
David Boder: Yes.

00:37:10.190 --> 00:38:21.602
Baruch Friedman: And so it had happened when that patrol had come, that German patrol. And we had not been able to surround all of them, and many of them had escaped back. And there they told that here there is a great host of partisans and something has to be done to clear them out. So they began with mortars to...because they did not trust themselves to come close. They did not know how large a force there was. So they began to shoot at us with mortars in order to chase us away. Immediately our commander had a conference with the headquarters and...it was at eleven, forenoon...and at four in the afternoon we made a decision to cross the border. He worked out a plan...he worked out a plan, and...and at four in the afternoon we went and circled the entire front. There were Rumanians, too, who were fighting against...against the Germans. And we found them. And at about two at night we crossed the front line, together with the cables, with everything. But we were also prepared to...

00:38:21.602 --> 00:38:22.522
David Boder: What does it mean, ‘with the cables’?

00:38:22.522 --> 00:38:27.074
Baruch Friedman: The...the cables which had been strung. The telephone wires from one front to the other front.

00:38:27.074 --> 00:38:27.505
David Boder: Yes.

00:38:27.505 --> 00:38:33.598
Baruch Friedman: And...and...and at four in the morning we went over to the Russians.

00:38:33.598 --> 00:38:35.895
David Boder: Did they Russians know that you were coming?

00:38:35.895 --> 00:38:40.111
Baruch Friedman: They asked, ‘Who is it?’ So we said, ‘Washy’ [yours], our own.

00:38:40.111 --> 00:38:40.578
David Boder: Yes.

00:38:40.578 --> 00:38:44.817
Baruch Friedman: Nu, they received us at once and we became free.

00:38:44.817 --> 00:38:45.285
David Boder: Nu?

00:38:45.285 --> 00:38:57.024
Baruch Friedman: Yes. To this I still want to....We had been prepared for a battle. Had it come, naturally, we would have offered resistance.

00:38:57.024 --> 00:38:58.048
David Boder: [In German/Yiddish] Against whom?

00:38:58.048 --> 00:38:59.328
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] Against the German who...

00:38:59.328 --> 00:38:59.937
David Boder: Yes.

00:38:59.937 --> 00:39:01.076
Baruch Friedman: . . . in that crossing over.

00:39:01.076 --> 00:39:01.731
David Boder: Yes.

00:39:01.731 --> 00:39:18.491
Baruch Friedman: It was accompanied with great difficulties. The snow was deep, about two meters. And added to the high mountains to go up and down....But in spite of that we did not pay attention, and we....There were also many women among us who suffered greatly. But still we did cross over successfully.

00:39:18.491 --> 00:39:20.785
David Boder: Oh, there were women among the partisans?

00:39:20.785 --> 00:39:21.023
Baruch Friedman: Yes.

00:39:21.023 --> 00:39:22.058
David Boder: How many women were there?

00:39:22.058 --> 00:39:25.202
Baruch Friedman: There were about eight, ten women, too. Jewish women.

00:39:25.202 --> 00:39:27.349
David Boder: Did they shoot...

00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:32.991
Baruch Friedman: They took part in everything the same as the men. There was no difference. How the men, so the women, too.

00:39:32.991 --> 00:39:33.277
David Boder: Hm.

00:39:33.277 --> 00:39:37.701
Baruch Friedman: And so we had crossed. It was on the 12th of February, ’45, we went over...

00:39:37.701 --> 00:39:38.030
David Boder: To the Russians.

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:38.689
Baruch Friedman: . . . to the Russians.

00:39:38.689 --> 00:39:40.535
David Boder: Nu, what happened then?

00:39:40.535 --> 00:39:42.601
Baruch Friedman: Everybody was set free.

00:39:42.601 --> 00:39:45.777
David Boder: What does that mean? Were you brought before an officer? Were you brought...

00:39:45.777 --> 00:39:46.687
Baruch Friedman: Yes, we had come there...

00:39:46.687 --> 00:39:47.837
David Boder: Tell about it.

00:39:47.837 --> 00:40:08.685
Baruch Friedman: We arrived there at the chief commander, at headquarters. And we were questioned about where we came from. We gave some....The officer gave a summary...a glance over the front, how...how the Germans were located. And everyone received a confirmation from the Russians that he is at liberty to go home. And everyone went home—free. Volunteers who wanted...

00:40:08.685 --> 00:40:12.477
David Boder: Oh, the Russians already had your town, that you call home.

00:40:12.477 --> 00:40:14.085
Baruch Friedman: Yes, they already had my home [town].

00:40:14.085 --> 00:40:14.522
David Boder: Aha.

00:40:14.522 --> 00:40:15.084
Baruch Friedman: Yes, they had [it] already. Yes.

00:40:15.084 --> 00:40:15.443
David Boder: Nu?

00:40:15.443 --> 00:40:21.551
Baruch Friedman: And thus everybody was able to go home free. Volunteers who wanted had...

00:40:21.551 --> 00:40:22.114
David Boder: Remained with the Russians?

00:40:22.114 --> 00:40:26.448
Baruch Friedman: . . . remained with the Russians. They had voluntarily...or reported to the Czechoslovakian army.

00:40:26.448 --> 00:40:28.118
David Boder: Oh, there was already a Czechoslovakian army.

00:40:28.118 --> 00:40:32.488
Baruch Friedman: At that time it had come from Russia and one had to report in Kosice.

00:40:32.488 --> 00:40:33.347
David Boder: Aha.

00:40:33.347 --> 00:40:33.972
Baruch Friedman: Yes.

00:40:33.972 --> 00:40:46.711
David Boder: Nu, tell me this. In your partisan...partisan group how many were officers, how many...how was all that carried out?

00:40:46.711 --> 00:40:51.446
Baruch Friedman: There was a...there were three officers.

00:40:51.446 --> 00:40:53.890
David Boder: [In English] Yes? [In Yiddish] That means that Czech, Mayer?

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:57.418
Baruch Friedman: Mayer. Then there was one Byczanowski.

00:40:57.418 --> 00:40:57.871
David Boder: Hm.

00:40:57.871 --> 00:40:59.214
Baruch Friedman: Also a Slovak.

00:40:59.214 --> 00:40:59.854
David Boder: Aha.

00:40:59.854 --> 00:41:04.056
Baruch Friedman: Then there was another one. I cannot remember exactly what his name was.

00:41:04.056 --> 00:41:04.796
David Boder: A Jew or not a Jew?

00:41:04.796 --> 00:41:05.634
Baruch Friedman: No, not a Jew.

00:41:05.634 --> 00:41:06.884
David Boder: And so those three officers were...

00:41:06.884 --> 00:41:08.195
Baruch Friedman: Were Gentiles.

00:41:08.195 --> 00:41:08.841
David Boder: . . . Gentiles.

00:41:08.841 --> 00:41:17.510
Baruch Friedman: Why? Because they had the technique, the real training. Our...we, among ourselves, also had a leader. His name was...

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:18.129
David Boder: A Jew?

00:41:18.129 --> 00:41:19.008
Baruch Friedman: . . . Greenbaum. Yes.

00:41:19.008 --> 00:41:19.534
David Boder: Yes.

00:41:19.534 --> 00:41:22.783
Baruch Friedman: A Jewish leader, Greenbaum. We had a radio apparatus.

00:41:22.783 --> 00:41:24.720
David Boder: Yes. For sending or for receiving.

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:25.720
Baruch Friedman: No, for receiving.

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:26.891
David Boder: Yes.

00:41:26.891 --> 00:41:28.328
Baruch Friedman: That is how we knew all the news.

00:41:28.328 --> 00:41:28.781
David Boder: Yes?

00:41:28.781 --> 00:41:37.434
Baruch Friedman: And we also had a...a...what is it called, an apparatus for listening, an intercepting apparatus for listining, to listen in on telephone conversations.

00:41:37.434 --> 00:41:38.137
David Boder: Aha.

00:41:38.137 --> 00:41:39.168
Baruch Friedman: We had that.

00:41:39.168 --> 00:41:40.730
David Boder: How did it work?

00:41:40.730 --> 00:42:01.672
Baruch Friedman: That? We listened in on all the...the...the front communications between the Germans. And then the chief...the chief commander turned it over to higher authorities of the partisans, because higher up there, not far, was a high center, a place of a larger partisan group.

00:42:01.672 --> 00:42:02.102
David Boder: Oh.

00:42:02.102 --> 00:42:02.851
Baruch Friedman: Yes.

00:42:02.851 --> 00:42:03.478
David Boder: [In German/Yiddish] There were other groups.

00:42:03.478 --> 00:42:07.041
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] Other groups. Not just us. We were just a small section of that, a branch.

00:42:07.041 --> 00:42:07.880
David Boder: Yes.

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:11.145
Baruch Friedman: But there were hundreds and hundreds of partisans, in the whole area.

00:42:11.145 --> 00:42:11.958
David Boder: Aha.

00:42:11.958 --> 00:42:13.020
Baruch Friedman: Yes.

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:13.583
David Boder: Nu?

00:42:13.583 --> 00:42:22.376
Baruch Friedman: Sometimes there would be a task to blow up a bridge or...or to blow up a train.

00:42:22.376 --> 00:42:22.888
David Boder: Hm.

00:42:22.888 --> 00:42:30.779
Baruch Friedman: But all this was in this form. It was one’s duty. A...a task. This one and this one have to go. And we went.

00:42:30.779 --> 00:42:33.923
David Boder: Nu? How many partisans were killed?

00:42:33.923 --> 00:42:34.871
Baruch Friedman: About four.

00:42:34.871 --> 00:42:35.328
David Boder: Aha.

00:42:35.328 --> 00:42:37.718
Baruch Friedman: In the whole time about four people were killed. Not more.

00:42:37.718 --> 00:42:40.090
David Boder: [In German/Yiddish] How many Jews among them?

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:46.945
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] There were no Jews. One was wounded. One died, died a normal death.

00:42:46.945 --> 00:42:47.430
David Boder: Yes?

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:47.430
Baruch Friedman: Yes.

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:49.008
David Boder: Nu, go on.

00:42:49.008 --> 00:42:56.195
Baruch Friedman: Yes. [Pause.] Nu, what else?

00:42:56.195 --> 00:42:57.764
David Boder: [In German/Yiddish] So then you came home?

00:42:57.764 --> 00:43:07.340
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] Home. But this is...yes. This is what happened. Coming home I found nothing. One alone of the family.

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:07.979
David Boder: No one?

00:43:07.979 --> 00:43:08.850
Baruch Friedman: No one.

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:09.183
David Boder: Nu?

00:43:09.183 --> 00:43:11.136
Baruch Friedman: From the whole family only myself. What does one do here?

00:43:11.136 --> 00:43:13.271
David Boder: And who was in the house?

00:43:13.271 --> 00:43:19.237
Baruch Friedman: Nobody. Everything was deserted. The windows broken, the house broken. Everything, everything in ruins.

00:43:19.237 --> 00:43:20.694
David Boder: What does it mean? Had it been bombed?

00:43:20.694 --> 00:43:24.850
Baruch Friedman: Not....This was because...because the house had been standing empty, uninhabited.

00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:25.210
David Boder: Yes?

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:33.283
Baruch Friedman: People had gone there and tossed everything around, broken up everything. So that the whole house had remained completely, totally empty.

00:43:33.283 --> 00:43:34.827
David Boder: Whose house was it? Your own house?

00:43:34.827 --> 00:43:35.844
Baruch Friedman: Our own house.

00:43:35.844 --> 00:43:36.359
David Boder: Nu?

00:43:36.359 --> 00:43:38.878
Baruch Friedman: We had fields there, too.

00:43:38.878 --> 00:43:39.607
David Boder: [In German] Horses?

00:43:39.607 --> 00:43:40.575
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] Fields. Fields.

00:43:40.575 --> 00:43:41.387
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:43:41.387 --> 00:44:08.666
Baruch Friedman: All the time the Gentiles cultivated the fields. So we wanted some sort of a....Coming home I thought that we will enjoy a little more consideration where we are. Coming home already liberated, we will have a little more consideration. In the meantime, I see nothing [of the sort]. I considered some [of the people] who I knew had committed misdeeds on transports against the Jews. I wanted to avenge myself on them. I had been....I thought I had some right because of having been some sort of a partisan...

00:44:08.666 --> 00:44:09.183
David Boder: Yes.

00:44:09.183 --> 00:44:36.277
Baruch Friedman: So I was laughed at. Why? Because among the leaders of the Slovakian government were these same anti-Semites who were before, before that. So that I did not trust myself, and I decided on that: I leave everything. I leave the house. I leave the field, and I go to my goal. I am going Home. And so I decided. I go. I crossed over....Later yet, after having been the whole time...

00:44:36.277 --> 00:44:37.573
David Boder: Did you not sell the house?

00:44:37.573 --> 00:45:12.489
Baruch Friedman: No. One cannot sell because they have not returned. The Slovaks have not returned to this day to the Jews their properties. And for everything is still as it used to be. So I decided what will I wait for. There may come some more evil, or....And many times we heard about the pogroms against the jews. Here one was beaten, and there one was beaten. If one wanted to get some justice, people would pay many times with their lives, too. So I went and crossed into Germany and from there on to the goal, towards Eretz.

00:45:12.489 --> 00:45:18.547
David Boder: Tell me, how did you go to Germany and how did you arrive in Italy?

00:45:18.547 --> 00:45:31.090
Baruch Friedman: This was...with a transport I crossed. Arriving in Prague I received certain directions. At that and that time a transport is leaving. And at that and that time...

00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:32.488
David Boder: A transport of what?

00:45:32.488 --> 00:45:33.274
Baruch Friedman: Of Jews...

00:45:33.274 --> 00:45:33.512
David Boder: Yes.

00:45:33.512 --> 00:45:44.894
Baruch Friedman: . . . which is going over to Germany. And with this transport there and there I have to report to what place. And there I will cross over. And it really was so. Exactly. At the right time, at the exact place [?].

00:45:44.894 --> 00:45:48.032
David Boder: [In German/Yiddish] Who gave those instructions, the...the Czechs or...

00:45:48.032 --> 00:45:49.492
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] No, everything the Jews. Everything by Jews.

00:45:49.492 --> 00:45:52.065
David Boder: Did the transport go by train?

00:45:52.065 --> 00:45:53.507
Baruch Friedman: No, on foot.

00:45:53.507 --> 00:45:56.840
David Boder: Oh, so it was a group. Not that you travelled...

00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:59.146
Baruch Friedman: No, no, no, no, no. As far as the border...

00:45:59.146 --> 00:46:00.259
David Boder: So how did you travel?

00:46:00.259 --> 00:46:02.298
Baruch Friedman: As far as the border by train.

00:46:02.298 --> 00:46:02.504
David Boder: Yes.

00:46:02.504 --> 00:46:03.016
Baruch Friedman: By train.

00:46:03.016 --> 00:46:03.234
David Boder: Nu?

00:46:03.234 --> 00:46:11.201
Baruch Friedman: And across the border....There was an assembly point and there we crossed the border. Entirely on foot. We walked about twelve kilometers.

00:46:11.201 --> 00:46:12.295
David Boder: Legally or illegally?

00:46:12.295 --> 00:46:12.951
Baruch Friedman: Illegally.

00:46:12.951 --> 00:46:17.900
David Boder: [In German/Yiddish] Nu, and how did you get the money to travel, and this and that? Did the Russians give you anything or what was done?

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:26.107
Baruch Friedman: [In Yiddish] No, not that. It was still so that the...the UNRRA was aiding. And we received help from the Joint.

00:46:26.107 --> 00:46:26.381
David Boder: Yes.

00:46:26.381 --> 00:46:30.030
Baruch Friedman: So that so far we still could go over.

00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:32.275
David Boder: Nu? And so?

00:46:32.275 --> 00:46:38.008
Baruch Friedman: And from there I have...In Germany I sat around for about three months, four months time.

00:46:38.008 --> 00:46:40.022
David Boder: What sort of things did you have along with you?

00:46:40.022 --> 00:46:47.811
Baruch Friedman: A rucksack with things which I had received. Some things I still had with me and some things which I had received from the UNRRA, from the Joint.

00:46:47.811 --> 00:46:48.826
David Boder: What did you receive?

00:46:48.826 --> 00:46:50.910
Baruch Friedman: Some pants, a jacket.

00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:51.293
David Boder: Yes.

00:46:51.293 --> 00:46:55.901
Baruch Friedman: And a shirt. And crossed the border. What does one need? Today one does not need any more.

00:46:55.901 --> 00:46:57.681
David Boder: Nu? What does it mean ‘one does not need any more’?

00:46:57.681 --> 00:47:02.261
Baruch Friedman: One does not need any more. What one has here....Today one does not need any more. The less one has the better...

00:47:02.261 --> 00:47:03.556
David Boder: Nu?

00:47:03.556 --> 00:47:05.053
Baruch Friedman: It is easier to walk.

00:47:05.053 --> 00:47:06.440
David Boder: Go on.

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:13.640
Baruch Friedman: And there in Germany I sat around three and a half months or...or about four. And on with a transport...

00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:14.965
David Boder: Where did you sit around in Germany?

00:47:14.965 --> 00:47:15.840
Baruch Friedman: In Fürth.

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:23.093
David Boder: And so do not call it a transport. They were groups which had decided to go. It was not officially, so to say, that the...

00:47:23.093 --> 00:47:23.543
Baruch Friedman: It was...

00:47:23.543 --> 00:47:25.088
David Boder: . . . UNRRA had given a transport.

00:47:25.088 --> 00:47:31.711
Baruch Friedman: No, the UNRRA did not give. There were Jews who organized special transports which were going every day.

00:47:31.711 --> 00:47:33.875
David Boder: Yes. And where did one go?

00:47:33.875 --> 00:47:36.850
Baruch Friedman: Everyone went into a German lager.

00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:38.328
David Boder: Yes. Into a German lager.

00:47:38.328 --> 00:47:38.675
Baruch Friedman: Yes.

00:47:38.675 --> 00:47:41.737
David Boder: Into which did....In the American Zone, in the English Zone, where...

00:47:41.737 --> 00:47:46.772
Baruch Friedman: Some....Coming over the German side everyone could go wherever he wanted.

00:47:46.772 --> 00:47:47.835
David Boder: Yes? Nu?

00:47:47.835 --> 00:47:53.865
Baruch Friedman: I went to Lager Fürth. There I had an acquaintance. And there...

00:47:53.865 --> 00:47:56.152
David Boder: Did you know you had an acquaintance there?

00:47:56.152 --> 00:48:01.100
Baruch Friedman: At first I was at Fürth for a visit.

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:01.538
David Boder: Aha.

00:48:01.538 --> 00:48:07.381

00:48:07.381 --> 00:48:11.005
David Boder: How does one walk around in Germany? Were you not stopped?

00:48:11.005 --> 00:48:17.551
Baruch Friedman: No, no one was stopped. Everything was free. No one was ever asked for documents. Without...without papers.

00:48:17.551 --> 00:48:18.207
David Boder: Nu, go on.

00:48:18.207 --> 00:48:22.785

00:48:33.499 --> 00:48:43.907

00:49:08.951 --> 00:49:11.873

00:49:11.873 --> 00:49:18.263
