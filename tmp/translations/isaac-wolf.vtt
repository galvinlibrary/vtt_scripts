00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.872
David Boder: Yes?

00:02:28.872 --> 00:02:35.715

00:02:35.715 --> 00:02:36.496
David Boder: Yes?

00:02:36.496 --> 00:02:42.245
Isaac Wolf: I was in the Polish army, and then I was...fought under Lemberg, too.

00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:43.010
David Boder: Yes?

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.042
Isaac Wolf: And then I was injured.

00:02:45.042 --> 00:02:46.652
David Boder: Wounded?

00:02:46.652 --> 00:02:47.542

00:02:53.026 --> 00:02:54.604
David Boder: You were wounded in the hand, nu?

00:02:54.604 --> 00:02:55.073
Isaac Wolf: Yes.

00:02:55.073 --> 00:02:55.729
David Boder: And?

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:59.838
Isaac Wolf: And then I was lying in the hospital, and then marched in the Russian army.

00:02:59.838 --> 00:03:00.291
David Boder: Yes?

00:03:00.291 --> 00:03:06.557
Isaac Wolf: And then I was already in Russia, that means, in Lemberg, since then the Russian army was already in Lemberg.

00:03:06.557 --> 00:03:07.088
David Boder: Yes?

00:03:07.088 --> 00:03:14.837
Isaac Wolf: And then I was lying in the hospital and became well. I was under the Russian government.

00:03:14.837 --> 00:03:17.806
David Boder: Yes, that was when there was no war yet.

00:03:17.806 --> 00:03:18.306
Isaac Wolf: In ’39.

00:03:18.306 --> 00:03:19.915
David Boder: Yes, Russia and the Germans...

00:03:19.915 --> 00:03:22.618
Isaac Wolf: When Poland and Germany were fighting, yes.

00:03:22.618 --> 00:03:23.665
David Boder: But not Russian with Germany.

00:03:23.665 --> 00:03:24.946
Isaac Wolf: No, there was so...that...

00:03:24.946 --> 00:03:25.931
David Boder: Not officially.

00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:31.259
Isaac Wolf: Not officially. It was so: When the Russians have...the Germans shelled Lemberg...

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:32.352
David Boder: Yes?

00:03:32.352 --> 00:03:37.477
Isaac Wolf: . . . the Russian...the Russians at Lemberg answered with...also, because there was also a kind of misunderstanding...

00:03:37.477 --> 00:03:38.102
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:38.102 --> 00:03:41.086
Isaac Wolf: . . . between the armies. There was also a certain...for a few hours there was also such...

00:03:41.086 --> 00:03:44.445
David Boder: But officially Russian and Germany were not at war.

00:03:44.445 --> 00:03:44.945
Isaac Wolf: Not at war.

00:03:44.945 --> 00:03:48.976
David Boder: And so, nu? So you were in the hospital. And what happened then?

00:03:48.976 --> 00:03:55.405
Isaac Wolf: And then I was lying...maybe six weeks I was in the hospital. Then I went home.

00:03:55.405 --> 00:03:59.546
David Boder: Yes. Whom did you have at home? Who was your father, your mother? How many were in the family?

00:03:59.546 --> 00:04:03.952
Isaac Wolf: I was...I had the mother, the father, sisters, a brother...

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:05.171
David Boder: How many sisters?

00:04:05.171 --> 00:04:06.421
Isaac Wolf: I had two sisters.

00:04:06.421 --> 00:04:07.686
David Boder: Older or younger?

00:04:07.686 --> 00:04:09.623
Isaac Wolf: One...two younger.

00:04:09.623 --> 00:04:10.248
David Boder: Aha.

00:04:10.248 --> 00:04:11.467
Isaac Wolf: And one brother, an older one. A brother.

00:04:11.467 --> 00:04:11.967
David Boder: Yes.

00:04:11.967 --> 00:04:13.186
Isaac Wolf: He lived in Radomsko.

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:13.811
David Boder: Yes. And your father and your mother?

00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:14.280
Isaac Wolf: Yes.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.249
David Boder: And? You came home.

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:16.765
Isaac Wolf: Yes.

00:04:16.765 --> 00:04:17.374
David Boder: What did you do then?

00:04:17.374 --> 00:04:23.390
Isaac Wolf: Then I started working. The Russians did not allow [one] to go around without work.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.921
David Boder: Yes.

00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:27.968
Isaac Wolf: Because if one did not work they asked, ‘On what do you live?’

00:04:27.968 --> 00:04:28.562
David Boder: Hm.

00:04:28.562 --> 00:04:31.015
Isaac Wolf: So everybody had to go to work.

00:04:31.015 --> 00:04:31.797
David Boder: Hm.

00:04:31.797 --> 00:04:36.906
Isaac Wolf: Then I started working. I worked on the railroad. I was learning...

00:04:36.906 --> 00:04:37.360
David Boder: Yes?

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.095
Isaac Wolf: I was learning to be a train machinist. [Pause.]

00:04:40.095 --> 00:04:51.361
David Boder: And so you were learning to be a train machinist. Nu?

00:04:51.361 --> 00:05:03.985
Isaac Wolf: Nu, and then I worked throught the whole time. Nu, it was so. When one day I didn’t work—not, I but others—then the Russians asked why he didn’t come that day to work.

00:05:03.985 --> 00:05:04.656
David Boder: Yes?

00:05:04.656 --> 00:05:09.593
Isaac Wolf: When...One had to have a certain reason why he didn’t come to work.

00:05:09.593 --> 00:05:10.968
David Boder: Did they pay for the work?

00:05:10.968 --> 00:05:12.561
Isaac Wolf: For the work they paid, yes.

00:05:12.561 --> 00:05:14.186
David Boder: Was one able to live on it?

00:05:14.186 --> 00:05:21.248
Isaac Wolf: Nu, like in Russia, there was the arrangement that when one earned a hundred and fifty rubles, he also could live on the hundred...

00:05:21.248 --> 00:05:22.342
David Boder: Yes.

00:05:22.342 --> 00:05:35.451
Isaac Wolf: . . . rubles, because it was so, that they ate in the [community] kitchen. And in the kitchen it cost sixty rubles for a dinner, and fifty rubles, and hundred rubles, approximately so [he apparently wanted to say kopeks].

00:05:35.451 --> 00:05:36.873
David Boder: Hundred and fifty rubles per day?

00:05:36.873 --> 00:05:37.576
Isaac Wolf: Per day.

00:05:37.576 --> 00:05:38.388
David Boder: Yes, yes. And?

00:05:38.388 --> 00:05:42.807
Isaac Wolf: Nu, and so one could...No! A hundred and fifty rubles a month!

00:05:42.807 --> 00:05:43.807
David Boder: Nu, that means only kopeks.

00:05:43.807 --> 00:05:44.978
Isaac Wolf: Thirty kopeks [word not clear].

00:05:44.978 --> 00:05:46.071
David Boder: Oh, yes. [Word not clear].

00:05:46.071 --> 00:05:46.602
Isaac Wolf: Yes, yes.

00:05:46.602 --> 00:05:46.946
David Boder: Nu?

00:05:46.946 --> 00:05:51.382
Isaac Wolf: Nu, one could come out so...to save money one...

00:05:51.382 --> 00:05:52.116
David Boder: One could not?

00:05:52.116 --> 00:05:58.670
Isaac Wolf: Could not in Russia. But one could come out very well in Russia for this money, for this money that one got.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.700
David Boder: Nu?

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:09.820
Isaac Wolf: And then when I already worked as machinist, then I already earned thousand, thousand five hundred rubles. That was already very much. On this two families could live already a whole month.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.536
David Boder: Nu? You worked as a machinist on a railroad?

00:06:12.536 --> 00:06:13.367
Isaac Wolf: Railroad, and I drove...

00:06:13.367 --> 00:06:14.804
David Boder: With a parovoz [locomotive]?

00:06:14.804 --> 00:06:15.773
Isaac Wolf: With a parovoz.

00:06:15.773 --> 00:06:16.492
David Boder: With a locomotive.

00:06:16.492 --> 00:06:17.164
Isaac Wolf: With a locomotive, yes.

00:06:17.164 --> 00:06:18.070
David Boder: Nu, go on.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.663
Isaac Wolf: And...

00:06:20.663 --> 00:06:22.507
David Boder: How long did one study to be a machinist?

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:38.350
Isaac Wolf: In Russia were courses. One could study six months, and eight months, and a year. But after three months one finished the course. And during the time of the course they received exactly as much as if they were working—a little less, but they could manage, too, with this money.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.116
David Boder: Nu, go on.

00:06:39.116 --> 00:06:42.709
Isaac Wolf: And then I worked until the time of the war.

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:43.584
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:43.584 --> 00:06:48.459
Isaac Wolf: At the time of the war, when the German fliers already were bombing Lemberg, I was still...

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:48.459
David Boder: When the war started between the Russians and the Germans.

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:50.803
Isaac Wolf: Between the Russians and the Germans, yes.

00:06:50.803 --> 00:06:50.803
David Boder: Nu.

00:06:50.803 --> 00:06:52.021
Isaac Wolf: And then I also worked on the railroad.

00:06:52.021 --> 00:06:53.911
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:53.911 --> 00:06:59.473
Isaac Wolf: And until the...up to two days before the Germans entered...

00:06:59.473 --> 00:07:00.395
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:00.395 --> 00:07:07.458
Isaac Wolf: . . . I worked on the railroad, under the bombs, under everything. Everybody had to go to work. He couldn’t leave the work.

00:07:07.458 --> 00:07:08.521
David Boder: Nu?

00:07:08.521 --> 00:07:14.005
Isaac Wolf: And then, when the Germans were already at Lemberg, then I couldn’t go to take leave of my parents [to say goodbye].

00:07:14.005 --> 00:07:14.567
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:14.567 --> 00:07:15.927
Isaac Wolf: And till the...

00:07:15.927 --> 00:07:16.817
David Boder: You could not go with your parents.

00:07:16.817 --> 00:07:35.848
Isaac Wolf: No, I couldn’t throw away the work. And I couldn’t go with them. And I have not seen my parents till this day. And I was...and then I ran away with the Russian Army farther, and I ran as far as Woloczysk. And there, near Kiev...on the other side, we were surrounded by the Germans.

00:07:35.848 --> 00:07:37.754
David Boder: On the other side?

00:07:37.754 --> 00:07:39.010
Isaac Wolf: On the other side [of the river]...already near the Russian border.

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:39.409
David Boder: Yes?

00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:42.183
Isaac Wolf: There was Podwoloczysk and Woloczysk.

00:07:42.183 --> 00:07:42.769
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:42.769 --> 00:07:44.315
Isaac Wolf: It was already near the...in the Ukraine.

00:07:44.315 --> 00:07:44.815
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:44.815 --> 00:07:49.971
Isaac Wolf: And then we entered...the Russians had already captured...surrounded the forest, and the...

00:07:49.971 --> 00:07:50.690
David Boder: The Germans.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:08:02.940
Isaac Wolf: The Germans. And we were...we organized as partisans, by ourselves, on our own, because we knew what...what he does with the Jews because we had read the book Unser...the Unser...Mein Kampf.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:03.597
David Boder: Yes?

00:08:03.597 --> 00:08:15.175
Isaac Wolf: Then we knew what the meaning is of the Judenfrage [Jewish question]. Therefore, we knew that voluntarily we will not go to death. As long as we will be able to save the [our] life we will save it.

00:08:15.175 --> 00:08:17.095
David Boder: But, yes, you said that you went with the partisans. Why didn’t...

00:08:17.095 --> 00:08:17.579
Isaac Wolf: But yes.

00:08:17.579 --> 00:08:19.081
David Boder: . . . you go with the regular army?

00:08:19.081 --> 00:08:31.940
Isaac Wolf: They didn’t want to accept us then, because they didn’t know who we were. They did take into the Russian army...from ’39 till ’41, until the time of the war, the younger ones were taken.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.065
David Boder: In Poland, yes.

00:08:33.065 --> 00:08:44.884
Isaac Wolf: Of the Poles. There was no difference, Jews, Poles, Ukrainians, everybody. But when he knew that...In the time of the war they [the Russians] didn’t want to take us without...that means, I should say, without endorsement it is in Russian.

00:08:44.884 --> 00:08:45.931
David Boder: Without guarantees...

00:08:45.931 --> 00:08:47.150
Isaac Wolf: Yes. And then...

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:47.775
David Boder: . . . sponsorship.

00:08:47.775 --> 00:09:18.004
Isaac Wolf: Yes. Then we were taken. And we were told that we should go farther into Russia. There we will be taken under a commission, and then we will be accepted [?]. We ourselves saw how bad...bad the situation was. And we had nothing in our hands. We can’t protect our lives. And we took to the forest. Then many people had been shot, Russian soldiers. We took from the dead the weapons into our hands. Rifles and automatics and everything was there, and then we were...I lived eight days in the trees.

00:09:18.004 --> 00:09:18.504
David Boder: In the trees?

00:09:18.504 --> 00:09:25.332
Isaac Wolf: In the trees I lived. With the straps that I kept till this day as a souvenir, I tied myself, one strap around the legs...

00:09:25.332 --> 00:09:25.801
David Boder: A strap [belt]?

00:09:25.801 --> 00:09:36.457
Isaac Wolf: A strap, yes. And with one I tied myself around the body, entirely, so that I shouldn’t fall down. And so I ate. I had in my pocket perhaps a half a kile of bread.

00:09:36.457 --> 00:09:37.144
David Boder: Hm.

00:09:37.144 --> 00:09:49.253
Isaac Wolf: And then with this half a kilo of bread...and there was also a friend who had about two kilos of dry bread. And with that...we were throwing it from one tree to another. And on this we lived a few days. Then...

00:09:49.253 --> 00:09:50.456
David Boder: Why did you have to be in a tree?

00:09:50.456 --> 00:09:51.487
Isaac Wolf: What?

00:09:51.487 --> 00:09:52.675
David Boder: Why did you have to be...

00:09:52.675 --> 00:09:58.206
Isaac Wolf: Why? Because the Germans were walking around. They were calling, ‘Here are...Jews and Russians are around here.’

00:09:58.206 --> 00:09:58.722
David Boder: Nu?

00:09:58.722 --> 00:10:05.526
Isaac Wolf: And we were afraid, because they were walking around looking for us in the forest. Then we saw that death is already before our eyes. You understand?

00:10:05.526 --> 00:10:06.112
David Boder: Yes.

00:10:06.112 --> 00:10:13.033
Isaac Wolf: We already have nothing to lose. We said, ‘If we go do it this way, maybe we will be able to save our lives.’

00:10:13.033 --> 00:10:13.236
David Boder: Yes.

00:10:13.236 --> 00:10:15.017
Isaac Wolf: And then we went across waters.

00:10:15.017 --> 00:10:16.892
David Boder: Yes.

00:10:16.892 --> 00:10:20.720
Isaac Wolf: So...across forests, and we met a Russian patrol.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.377
David Boder: Yes?

00:10:21.377 --> 00:10:25.049
Isaac Wolf: Then we said that we are going to defend ourselves as partisans.

00:10:25.049 --> 00:10:25.689
David Boder: Hm.

00:10:25.689 --> 00:10:29.392
Isaac Wolf: Voluntarily, because we don’t want to go to the Germans, because we know what he does with the Jews...

00:10:29.392 --> 00:10:29.861
David Boder: Hm.

00:10:29.861 --> 00:11:12.429
Isaac Wolf: . . . that when he catches a Jew then [he] cuts off hands, legs, ears. He cuts out...that the...the...He didn’t know himself what he should do. This barbarism was so terrible against the Jews that we have said that we don’t want to go to death voluntarily. And then we went on till the Russians met us. We banded together with the Russian people, with Jews, and we went again into the forest. We also killed many Germans, because they ‘started on us.’ We kept the pistol thus in the hand. He shouldn’t notice. And when he came close, said that we should hold our hands up, we held the hands thus. And at the same time we killed him. And we went on. There were a few [?] people with us. There were eight people.

00:11:12.429 --> 00:11:12.992
David Boder: Yes?

00:11:12.992 --> 00:11:47.498
Isaac Wolf: We killed fifteen Germans then...at that time. And before they could get ready to kill us, to search us, we killed them right away, and we went on. At that time we met a Russian patrol. And the Russians stopped us. They asked who we were. We showed that we have papers that we are Russian railroad workers, and we are Jews. [So] they let us live. They didn’t say anything. They believed us. And then they asked where we wanted to go. We said that to us it was all the same. We want to go into the Russian army or to join the Partisans, because we don’t want to go to death voluntarily.

00:11:47.498 --> 00:11:48.248
David Boder: Hm.

00:11:48.248 --> 00:11:54.342
Isaac Wolf: And we were taken into the Russian army. And then I went into the Russian army. I was in the Russian army. I have fought at Stalingrad.

00:11:54.342 --> 00:11:56.014
David Boder: Hm.

00:11:56.014 --> 00:12:01.936
Isaac Wolf: And I still have decorations from the Russian army. And I have fought till the last day of the war.

00:12:01.936 --> 00:12:02.670
David Boder: All right...

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:04.107
Isaac Wolf: I was three times injured...

00:12:04.107 --> 00:12:04.904
David Boder: Wounded?

00:12:04.904 --> 00:12:05.248
Isaac Wolf: Wounded.

00:12:05.248 --> 00:12:05.716
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:05.716 --> 00:12:06.154
Isaac Wolf: Yes.

00:12:06.154 --> 00:12:09.123
David Boder: In which part of the body had you been wounded?

00:12:09.123 --> 00:12:11.623
Isaac Wolf: Again in the hand, the second time. And then in the leg.

00:12:11.623 --> 00:12:12.561
David Boder: Hm.

00:12:12.561 --> 00:12:17.318
Isaac Wolf: I was...and I have fought. I said that voluntarily I don’t want to go to death.

00:12:17.318 --> 00:12:17.834
David Boder: Hm.

00:12:17.834 --> 00:12:23.303
Isaac Wolf: For my own sake, for vengeance, that [because] they took and killed my parents, sisters...

00:12:23.303 --> 00:12:24.647
David Boder: Did you know about it?

00:12:24.647 --> 00:12:32.158
Isaac Wolf: I knew about it, because I had heard. I had been told. People saw what was done to our parents. And at the same time when Lemberg was liberated, Lwow...

00:12:32.158 --> 00:12:33.408
David Boder: Oh, afterwards?

00:12:33.408 --> 00:13:05.467
Isaac Wolf: I asked around. And in Rawa-Ruska, too, from my friends...They answered that the Germans had killed them with a terrible death. They were taken and burned in crematories. They had their breasts cut off, the Jewish women, and the girls. They acted so terribly. So I said, if they did this to my parents, then I have nothing to lose. Then I...this [is] revenge for my parents. Here I see a chance of killing Germans. When I have killed them, then they can do to me what they want. Then I went on already, one can say, like a blind man.

00:13:05.467 --> 00:13:06.623
David Boder: Yes?

00:13:06.623 --> 00:13:17.801
Isaac Wolf: I went to the front. I fought. And the Russian army has recognized that I am...have fought well. I received these decorations. I received as follows: Krasnaya Zwiezda [Red Star].

00:13:17.801 --> 00:13:18.488
David Boder: Yes

00:13:18.488 --> 00:13:19.269
Isaac Wolf: You understand? A...

00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.457
David Boder: Yes, I understand.

00:13:19.457 --> 00:13:23.051
Isaac Wolf: The Red Star. And I received for Stalingrad a medal.

00:13:23.051 --> 00:13:25.145
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:25.145 --> 00:13:29.669
Isaac Wolf: The Good Fighter, that is in Russian Boyeviye Zaslugi.

00:13:29.669 --> 00:13:30.075
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:30.075 --> 00:13:33.996
Isaac Wolf: And I have received the Oboronyi Kavkas [Defense of the Causcasus]

00:13:33.996 --> 00:13:34.621
David Boder: What?

00:13:34.621 --> 00:14:06.574
Isaac Wolf: Kavkas...yes? And the Obronyi...Pobiedyi nad Germanyi [Victory over Germany]. That I already got towards the end, too. I have fought well, and I have...seen that...the...the...every moment stood before me the body of [my] father, mother, sisters, and brother whose picture I still have to this day. That was with me, with every man, with every Jew, that the blood was so boiling, that I know that I have nothing to lose. And then I went. I have taken very much revenge on these Germans.

00:14:06.574 --> 00:14:06.965
David Boder: Oh.

00:14:06.965 --> 00:14:12.684
Isaac Wolf: And then at the end of the war it was said that one can go to Lemberg. I went...during the time of the war I travelled to Lemberg.

00:14:12.684 --> 00:14:16.824
David Boder: Where were you?

00:14:16.824 --> 00:14:25.027
Isaac Wolf: I have been everywhere. In Rumania, Hungary, and Austria, and Chechia, Czechoslovakia. You know where that is...

00:14:25.027 --> 00:14:26.152
David Boder: Yes, I know.

00:14:26.152 --> 00:14:38.730
Isaac Wolf: And I was in Hungary and in Carpatho-Ukraine. There I fought. In that part there were Russians. The Ukrainian partisans were there, those ‘Banderovtzi,’ [the followers of the Ukranian leader Stepan Bandera]...those who were helping the Germans.

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:39.339
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:39.339 --> 00:15:06.106
Isaac Wolf: Because the Ukranians were indeed much worse than the Germans. The Germans did not do as much as the Ukranians. This was such kind of people. When they took in Lemberg the Jewish Community Council, they hanged them in the streets, and they said, ‘These are Jews. They have helped the Jews, and now we have to kill them.’ Alive, they cut off their eyes, cut our their ears. The noses...here they have burned out numbers with hot...like horses. Have you noticed? Sometimes numbers are made on horses, the military horses.

00:15:06.106 --> 00:15:07.481
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:07.481 --> 00:15:14.441
Isaac Wolf: That is what they did. They cut out pieces of flesh from the legs. Every Jew had to carry a...a...

00:15:14.441 --> 00:15:15.043
David Boder: A star?

00:15:15.043 --> 00:15:41.922
Isaac Wolf: A star. And then when I was in Lemberg, I have seen...I had come home. And strange people [strangers] were there, by us, in the dwelling where I had lived. I stopped still. The...the heart became so...turned to stone, that I couldn’t speak. I fell down, so...I was simply without strength. And I was revived. Then I went on. I went around. Where shall I go to look? I went to the cemetery...

00:15:41.922 --> 00:15:42.485
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:42.485 --> 00:15:44.063
Isaac Wolf: . . . on the Beth Hakodesh [The Sacred Abode].

00:15:44.063 --> 00:15:44.501
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:44.501 --> 00:16:35.758
Isaac Wolf: There I met an old man who told me,’Here lies your mother. She had been killed and here I have buried her.’ And then...at the same time I returned to the Russian army. And in the Russian army I again went to fight. And towards the end, when we had already heard that the war was ended, I was in Budapest. And then I was told that I can go home. Here I saw, if I come home, whom will I find there? Not a father, nobody. And it may come to it that I may commit suicide. It seemed thus: During the six years that I had lost so much health...and now I should come home and find nobody...that...how can I stay there home? Not anyone. We saw the...the Jewish homes. They had thrown bombs into them, that they shouldn’t even exist. And we still saw the blood that...

00:16:35.758 --> 00:16:36.851
David Boder: That was in Lemberg?

00:16:36.851 --> 00:16:46.829
Isaac Wolf: In Lemberg. The blood was still in the streets not dried...of the Jews. And there was still a Beth Hakodesh where the people had been burned when I was there. I still saw how the earth was still quivering.

00:16:46.829 --> 00:16:47.954
David Boder: Hm.

00:16:47.954 --> 00:16:50.516
Isaac Wolf: During the war...that people had just been put in.

00:16:50.516 --> 00:16:52.641
David Boder: Now wait a moment. Tell me that again.

00:16:52.641 --> 00:16:53.126
Isaac Wolf: Yes.

00:16:53.126 --> 00:16:54.626
David Boder: When did you see that the earth was quivering?

00:16:54.626 --> 00:16:56.579
Isaac Wolf: As soon as Lemberg was liberated.

00:16:56.579 --> 00:16:58.016
David Boder: Nu?

00:16:58.016 --> 00:17:01.516
Isaac Wolf: You understand? And then it was so...when the people were...the...the Ukranians...

00:17:01.516 --> 00:17:01.906
David Boder: Yes?

00:17:01.906 --> 00:17:01.906
Isaac Wolf: When they met a Jew on the street they killed him.

00:17:01.906 --> 00:17:05.156
David Boder: Nu?

00:17:05.156 --> 00:17:05.781
Isaac Wolf: You understand?

00:17:05.781 --> 00:17:06.109
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:07.234
Isaac Wolf: They weren’t able to exactly kill him.

00:17:07.234 --> 00:17:08.515
David Boder: Yes?

00:17:08.515 --> 00:17:17.168
Isaac Wolf: They...still living...dug a grave for him, and thus covered him with earth. I wasn’t far with the army, you understand? We entered a village, a town.

00:17:17.168 --> 00:17:17.721
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:17.721 --> 00:17:19.167
Isaac Wolf: As soon as we entered, you understand...

00:17:19.167 --> 00:17:19.440
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:47.480
Isaac Wolf: . . . the Ukranians ran away, and the Jews were still...the...this...the blood of the people was still warm...whom they had killed. Because they said...there were some Jews who had hidden themselves with Christians. They had given gold. They gave away all their possesions to the Christian so that he should hide them. So he took the gold and said: ‘I will hide you.’ He hid them, you understand? On the other side he told his other colleagues, the Ukranians. The Ukranians themselves have killed many more Jews than the Germans...

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.772
David Boder: But, yes, but, what do you say about the graves having moved?

00:17:49.772 --> 00:17:50.418
Isaac Wolf: Self...

00:17:50.418 --> 00:17:51.449
David Boder: Have you yourself seen it?

00:17:51.449 --> 00:17:52.956
Isaac Wolf: Myself. I saw it with my own eyes! Because...

00:17:52.956 --> 00:17:54.632
David Boder: How long ago had the people been buried?

00:17:54.632 --> 00:17:56.785
Isaac Wolf: A couple of hours before[Footnote: In Eastern Europe the sagging of a grave or the breaking of the grave hill was often superstitiously attributed to the movements or even struggle of the buried body. The inferences were that the buried person was not completely dead. Such rumors were specially persistent when the body was of an executed or murdered person, or of a person buried without religious right. Greater credence could be given to the stories of mass executions which nearly always carried the assertion that the machine gunned or gassed victims were not all completely dead at the moment of burial or cremation.]...

00:17:56.785 --> 00:17:58.354
Isaac Wolf: Yes.

00:17:58.354 --> 00:17:58.908
David Boder: Nu?

00:17:58.908 --> 00:18:11.029
Isaac Wolf: And then there was a Rumanian, also a doctor, who worked in a work-lager, you understand? And he was a young doctor. They retained him also with them, and then came a...

00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:13.551
David Boder: Who kept him with them? The Ukranians?

00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:34.878
Isaac Wolf: The Ukranians had kept...then they learned that he was a Jew so they took him, with the Germans together, you understand? He was told that he should dig for himself a grave and should lie down in it, you understand? They covered him with earth. And at the same time the Russian army made an attack, and he was...it was seen that the earth is quivering...

00:18:34.878 --> 00:18:35.493
David Boder: Hm.

00:18:35.493 --> 00:18:47.952
Isaac Wolf: . . . and he was dug up. He still was, one may say, twenty per cent alive. And then he was given injections. There was a medico who gave him injections, gave him camphor and thus his life was saved.

00:18:47.952 --> 00:18:53.504
David Boder: Tell me, how deep has one to be buried in order to see the earth moving?

00:18:53.504 --> 00:18:56.554
Isaac Wolf: Oh well, it was maybe a half a meter...half a meter, or something...

00:18:56.554 --> 00:18:57.242
David Boder: A half...

00:18:57.242 --> 00:18:58.455
Isaac Wolf: . . . like that. They didn’t...

00:18:58.455 --> 00:18:59.334
David Boder: Oh!

00:18:59.334 --> 00:19:02.001
Isaac Wolf: Yes, they didn’t...

00:19:02.001 --> 00:19:02.437
David Boder: Hm.

00:19:02.437 --> 00:19:03.994
Isaac Wolf: . . . bury too deep. He was told to dig himself, you understand?

00:19:03.994 --> 00:19:04.524
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:04.524 --> 00:19:08.884
Isaac Wolf: He was so covered with stones, with such...and thus have they exactly...they didn’t kill hundred per cent so that he should be dead, you understand?

00:19:08.884 --> 00:19:09.820
David Boder: Yes, I understand.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:24.728
Isaac Wolf: They did so, that he should suffer, the vengeance. When they me a woman, she had the breasts cut off. A Russian Star was made or a Jewish design. And then, when he met a young girl, he had relations with her.

00:19:24.728 --> 00:19:26.178
David Boder: Who? The Ukrainians?

00:19:26.178 --> 00:19:31.137
Isaac Wolf: The Ukranians, the Germans. The he says, ‘Have a souvenir, that the Germans and the Ukranians had you!’

00:19:31.137 --> 00:19:31.791
David Boder: Nu?

00:19:31.791 --> 00:19:48.136
Isaac Wolf: And then there were such cases, that a man had a woman. Then he had enough of her. He took vengeance. He broke off a stick, you understand? And the stick he pushed into her. He said, ‘Have that so you will have as a souvenir that the Germans had intercourse with you! So...so...

00:19:48.136 --> 00:19:49.416
David Boder: To a man?

00:19:49.416 --> 00:19:53.085
Isaac Wolf: To the woman. [Whispers with feeling.] Thus they did to a woman! You understand?

00:19:53.085 --> 00:19:55.241
David Boder: Say that again. They had not with the woman...

00:19:55.241 --> 00:19:56.085
Isaac Wolf: Themselves have with the woman...

00:19:56.085 --> 00:19:56.335
David Boder: . . . relations.

00:19:56.335 --> 00:19:56.772
Isaac Wolf: . . . had not relations with the body...

00:19:56.772 --> 00:19:57.099
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:57.099 --> 00:20:00.328
Isaac Wolf: . . . but with a stick. You understand?

00:20:00.328 --> 00:20:00.891
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:00.891 --> 00:20:05.225
Isaac Wolf: Pushed it in, and so they [treated] a young girl who never had had relations with anybody.

00:20:05.225 --> 00:20:06.412
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:06.412 --> 00:20:10.238
Isaac Wolf: Thus with such brutality have they behaved themselves towards Jewish girls.

00:20:10.238 --> 00:20:12.580
David Boder: Did you see that or...

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.469
Isaac Wolf: With my own eyes, personally I have met a girl...

00:20:14.469 --> 00:20:14.938
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:14.938 --> 00:20:22.139
Isaac Wolf: . . . a young girl who had that done to her, but you know how that came about. The Russian partisans walked always into the towns...

00:20:22.139 --> 00:20:23.373
David Boder: Yes? Into the towns.

00:20:23.373 --> 00:20:27.621
Isaac Wolf: Into the towns, or into the villages, and they were dressed in civilian clothes.

00:20:27.621 --> 00:20:28.183
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:28.183 --> 00:20:31.228
Isaac Wolf: At the same time they had communication with the Russian army...

00:20:31.228 --> 00:20:31.634
David Boder: Yes?

00:20:31.634 --> 00:20:56.668
Isaac Wolf: . . . or Russian patrols. Then they telephoned or gave a signal so that the Russian should enter. And they were caught. I was in a Russian village, that means in Bessarabia. Kamina is name of it.

00:20:56.668 --> 00:20:57.839
David Boder: What does it mean, ‘they were caught’?

00:20:57.839 --> 00:21:02.461
Isaac Wolf: The Ukranians, in the instant of the ‘attempt’ that they carried out against the Jews.

00:21:02.461 --> 00:21:03.008
David Boder: Yes?

00:21:03.008 --> 00:21:03.664
Isaac Wolf: You understand?

00:21:03.664 --> 00:21:04.367
David Boder: I understand.

00:21:04.367 --> 00:21:06.085
Isaac Wolf: At the same time I was present.

00:21:06.085 --> 00:21:12.862
David Boder: I understand, but one must be very careful of what one is saying. It must be the purest truth, not what somebody has told you.

00:21:12.862 --> 00:21:15.705
Isaac Wolf: No! I saw [it] with my own eyes, because I was for six years in the war.

00:21:15.705 --> 00:21:16.641
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:16.641 --> 00:21:20.420
Isaac Wolf: And I myself up to this day, up to the end of the war...

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.107
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:21.107 --> 00:21:22.778
Isaac Wolf: . . . I have experienced and have seen very much.

00:21:22.778 --> 00:21:24.808
David Boder: Yes. Nu? Go on.

00:21:24.808 --> 00:21:30.086
Isaac Wolf: And...at the same time I was...in Bessarabia it was...

00:21:30.086 --> 00:21:30.757
David Boder: Hm.

00:21:30.757 --> 00:21:32.710
Isaac Wolf: . . . we had liberated...it it called Kaminka...

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:33.663
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:33.663 --> 00:21:38.185
Isaac Wolf: . . . a...that is a large village, or a small town. It was a health resort...

00:21:38.185 --> 00:21:38.771
David Boder: Yes?

00:21:38.771 --> 00:21:44.614
Isaac Wolf: . . . we were liberated. We encountered Rumanian officers. It was near Bystrica [Bystrica Banska in Czechoslovakia or Bystrzyca in Poland].

00:21:44.614 --> 00:21:45.239
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:45.239 --> 00:21:46.271
Isaac Wolf: We had...

00:21:46.271 --> 00:21:47.583
David Boder: That is a river? [There is also a town by the same name.]

00:21:47.583 --> 00:21:47.973
Isaac Wolf: Yes.

00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:48.365
David Boder: Go on.

00:21:48.365 --> 00:21:55.285
Isaac Wolf: We met a Jewish woman with a young girl, a mother with a daughter. The girl was sixteen years old.

00:21:55.285 --> 00:21:55.800
David Boder: Hm.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:02.377
Isaac Wolf: And a Rumanian officer had lived with her. One with the mother and a colleague lived with the girl of the...

00:22:02.377 --> 00:22:02.830
David Boder: Lived with her?

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:03.705
Isaac Wolf: Lived, yes, and in one room.

00:22:03.705 --> 00:22:05.657
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:05.657 --> 00:22:18.110
Isaac Wolf: You understand? And when we came in we didn’t know...I asked whether any Jews still are living here. Because I did not believe that after that, what the German had done, that such a thing is possible that a Jew should remain alive. You understand?

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:18.829
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:18.829 --> 00:22:25.062
Isaac Wolf: Then they said that...when we had caught these Rumanian officers, the Rumanians had been yet with the Germans together.

00:22:25.062 --> 00:22:25.547
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:25.547 --> 00:22:32.077
Isaac Wolf: And they were still a little drunk, in that room. And at that time we entered as a patrol, and we caught these Rumanians...

00:22:32.077 --> 00:22:33.170
David Boder: And the women were there?

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:42.043
Isaac Wolf: With them together in that room! Then we put up the pistols and the automatics. So the Rumanians said, ‘Ask...ask the Frui...the Frui! [the woman].

00:22:42.043 --> 00:22:42.542
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:42.542 --> 00:22:46.423
Isaac Wolf: I said, ‘Are you Jewish?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, because the Rumanians [he probably means the Rumanian Jews] speak Jewish well.

00:22:46.423 --> 00:22:47.431
David Boder: Yes?

00:22:47.431 --> 00:22:58.975
Isaac Wolf: So I spoke to them. Say I, ‘Are you Jewish?’ Says she, ‘Yes.’ Say I, ‘What are you doing here?’ They say, ‘To survive. We wanted to save our lives, and the Rumanians told us, “If you want to save your lives you have to live with me.” They were wonderfully beautiful.

00:22:58.975 --> 00:23:00.709
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:00.709 --> 00:23:04.224
Isaac Wolf: And the girl was already pregnant from the Rumanian officer.

00:23:04.224 --> 00:23:04.865
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:04.865 --> 00:23:20.879
Isaac Wolf: And at the same time the mother, too. When I heard that, I began...the tears ran from my eyes, because for a long time I hadn’t seen any Jews. And so she told me this. So I immediately asked our doctor that he should give them help. He shouldn’t be too late for the young girl.

00:23:20.879 --> 00:23:21.410
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:31.221
Isaac Wolf: And at the same time they were established in living quarters. Those officers we took along with us, and we asked them why they did it. And it was given over to the court...

00:23:31.221 --> 00:23:31.627
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:31.627 --> 00:23:41.032
Isaac Wolf: And I have put that woman in a room, and I gave them food, and then I also put some clothes on the girl.

00:23:41.032 --> 00:23:43.688
David Boder: And so, what did you ask the doctor to do for the girl, an abortion?

00:23:43.688 --> 00:23:50.594
Isaac Wolf: Nu, of course. A sixteen year old...a fifteen, sixteen year old girl. What can one...from a Rumanian, a...

00:23:50.594 --> 00:23:51.672
David Boder: To have a baby.

00:23:51.672 --> 00:24:14.968
Isaac Wolf: Yes. And at the same time the mother, too. I have asked the mother about it. So soon she began to cry. She fell down to my feet, to thank us that we saved her life. She said she will never forget what I have done for her. And she requested that I should give her my name so that she may remember what I have done for her. And I left them there and we went forward with the front...

00:24:14.968 --> 00:24:18.046
David Boder: You don’t believe that the woman lived with him voluntarily?

00:24:18.046 --> 00:24:27.217
Isaac Wolf: They have told me that they had forced them into it. He told them that he will take them...throw them into the Bystrica, like he had thrown many thousands of Jews into the Bystrica. You understand?

00:24:27.217 --> 00:24:29.217
David Boder: Yes.

00:24:29.217 --> 00:24:33.291
Isaac Wolf: Because not far from the house which they lived in, perhaps a few hundred meters, was the...

00:24:33.291 --> 00:24:34.264
David Boder: The river.

00:24:34.264 --> 00:24:34.670
Isaac Wolf: . . . the river.

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:39.529
David Boder: Yes? Nu, how long were you in Stalingrad?

00:24:39.529 --> 00:24:41.154
Isaac Wolf: I can’t [words not clear].

00:24:41.154 --> 00:24:46.717
David Boder: Until Stalingrad was freed?

00:24:46.717 --> 00:24:52.185
Isaac Wolf: Until...until Stalingrad was freed I was the whole time there.

00:24:52.185 --> 00:24:57.122
David Boder: Would you tell us something about the last ten days in Stalingrad, or the last two weeks?

00:24:57.122 --> 00:24:57.434
Isaac Wolf: Yes.

00:24:57.434 --> 00:24:58.309
David Boder: Please.

00:24:58.309 --> 00:24:59.027
Isaac Wolf: I can tell you exactly...

00:24:59.027 --> 00:24:59.777
David Boder: Nu?

00:24:59.777 --> 00:25:06.308
Isaac Wolf: Towards the end, in Stalingrad, the Russian army concentrated all...the entire strength at Stalingrad...

00:25:06.308 --> 00:25:07.777
David Boder: The Germans?

00:25:07.777 --> 00:25:12.370
Isaac Wolf: The Russian army. Because they said, ‘Stalingrad, that is the question of life for Russia.’

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:13.151
David Boder: Yes?

00:25:13.151 --> 00:25:30.040
Isaac Wolf: ‘If Stalingrad is lost, then Russia is lost.’ The German army made a very strong attack and had prepared so much. And at the same time Russia had also prepared. When we were at Stalingrad we heard the news that-what is it called? -Japan...

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:30.899
David Boder: Japan.

00:25:30.899 --> 00:25:34.789
Isaac Wolf: . . . Japan, too, stands prepared to attack Russia...

00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:35.446
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:35.446 --> 00:25:50.007
Isaac Wolf: . . . and Turkey, too. That is what we were told in the newspaper. Then we knew that every Russian, and every Jew had nothing to lose, because death is before the eyes.

00:25:50.007 --> 00:25:50.507
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:50.507 --> 00:26:07.413
Isaac Wolf: And when one has been in the war a long time, you understand, then no fliers nor anything else makes an impression. One [it] becomes like a kind of music. And then the whole army was concentrated there. And one day there were placed many thousands, on one kilometer, many thousands of those Russian Katyushas and those...

00:26:07.413 --> 00:26:09.242
David Boder: What is a Katyusha?

00:26:09.242 --> 00:26:15.459
Isaac Wolf: The Katyusha is a...such, let us say, a weapon on top of an automobile, you understand?

00:26:15.459 --> 00:26:16.365
David Boder: Yes. A cannon?

00:26:16.365 --> 00:26:24.115
Isaac Wolf: A cannon. But it has very many...it has twenty-two, and the small ones are for twelve...for twenty-four, you understand? For continuous shooting.

00:26:24.115 --> 00:26:24.396
David Boder: Yes.

00:26:24.396 --> 00:26:25.615
Isaac Wolf: One...one after another. You understand?

00:26:25.615 --> 00:26:26.005
David Boder: Yes.

00:26:26.005 --> 00:26:28.193
Isaac Wolf: That is very...it helped very much.

00:26:28.193 --> 00:26:29.287
David Boder: [Words not clear.]

00:26:29.287 --> 00:26:51.609
Isaac Wolf: Very bad. The Germans became scared of these Katyushas. When they heard that the Katyushas start they would say, ‘Oh! Now comes...Ivan is coming!’ You understand? Then they became very scared. And then the Russian fliers started. Everything concentrated on them. And on a certain day there started the attack, and there the Russian army was surrounded.

00:26:51.609 --> 00:26:52.828
David Boder: The German army.

00:26:52.828 --> 00:26:53.718
Isaac Wolf: The German army.

00:26:53.718 --> 00:26:54.281
David Boder: Yes.

00:26:54.281 --> 00:27:01.093
Isaac Wolf: The Russians had surrounded the Germans. And then we lived in trenches. You understand? There were made against the...the German tanks...

00:27:01.093 --> 00:27:01.437
David Boder: Yes?

00:27:01.437 --> 00:27:15.093
Isaac Wolf: . . . there were made large pits, and there we lived. The cold was so terrible, that it was very hard. To make a little fire, one couldn’t because the German fliers flew around and patrolled. You understand?

00:27:15.093 --> 00:27:15.468
David Boder: Yes.

00:27:15.468 --> 00:27:38.514
Isaac Wolf: They watched. Perhaps there is an ack-ack. The bombs were so that one fell near the other, and many Germans were shot down and remained on the spot. I had a friend who fell near my hand. And I lay down next to his body, and he was killed, and I was...I still have a suit that has holes from these...shreds from the bomb...

00:27:38.514 --> 00:27:39.780
David Boder: From the fragments.

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:47.546
Isaac Wolf: . . . fragments from the bomb. And to me nothing happened. I had a book. It cut through my book, and nothing happened to me, and...

00:27:47.546 --> 00:27:47.984
David Boder: What kind of book was it?

00:27:47.984 --> 00:27:50.999
Isaac Wolf: What? It was a book, a Yiddish book.

00:27:50.999 --> 00:27:52.233
David Boder: Yes, nu?

00:27:52.233 --> 00:28:06.420
Isaac Wolf: And then I was at Stalingrad. It began again. It was seen that the Germans noticed that site. We were again moved half a kilometer. And there we sat again. The frosts were beyond endurance.

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:07.686
David Boder: Which site did the Germans notice?

00:28:07.686 --> 00:28:09.343
Isaac Wolf: That is near [words not clear]...

00:28:09.343 --> 00:28:10.858
David Boder: [Words not clear].

00:28:10.858 --> 00:28:57.584
Isaac Wolf: . . . there in the pits. They were covered, and there we lived. It could not be heated. The water was terribly frozen. There were terrible winds. And then an attack was made, and the Germans were surrounded, and then began the street fights in Stalingrad. I had been in Stalingrad also in the beginning of the war. It was a beautiful city. And during the war, Stalingrad was so ruined that you can’t find any houses. Very few houses...you could count them. And there were street fights. The street fights were most terrible! I can...I can...it is not possible for a man to describe it. The terrible fights that were there. I entered a bunker. You know what that is, an air-raid shelter.

00:28:57.584 --> 00:28:58.272
David Boder: Yes?

00:28:58.272 --> 00:29:14.897
Isaac Wolf: We had dug them ourselves. You found there civilians and Germans. When you jumped in...when you were unable to throw in a grenade so that you should kill only Germans, you jumped in there, so the Germans killed you. It was so terrible till Stalingrad was ta-...ta-...taken.

00:29:14.897 --> 00:29:17.054
David Boder: Hm.

00:29:17.054 --> 00:29:34.570
Isaac Wolf: And when Stalingrad was taken, there were very many German prisoners, SS men. And so we fought well. And then we went forward after Stalingrad. And then we were allowed to rest up a little and took over other companies, you understand?

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:35.070
David Boder: Yes.

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:38.149
Isaac Wolf: And then we have again...I was also in Korsa Szewczenka [?].

00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:39.539
David Boder: What is that?

00:29:39.539 --> 00:29:45.055
Isaac Wolf: Taht is also near...Korsa Szewzenka [?]. That is near Czerkassy...Smielo...farther up there.

00:29:45.055 --> 00:29:48.727
David Boder: Hm. Now tell me, what did one eat in Stalingrad while Stalingrad was besieged?

00:29:48.727 --> 00:30:01.280
Isaac Wolf: Eat? What shall I tell you? We had nothing to eat, nothing to drink, nothing. One ate a dry piece of bread, because it was impossible to get through. We were surrounded, thus. You understand?

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:01.749
David Boder: Yes.

00:30:01.749 --> 00:30:48.588
Isaac Wolf: With a dry piece of bread, with a little hot water or cold water. Without sugar. To smoke we didn’t have. We took leaves if we found some, no matter what kind of leaves. And one smoked, and the other opened...and caught the smoke into the mouth. With that, so have we...it was astonishingly terrible. It is not possible for every man. I myself had the...the...the feet were so swollen. And the...the...the...he told me, a doctor, that...that I got it from a weakening of the heart.

00:30:48.588 --> 00:30:49.463
David Boder: Nu.

00:30:49.463 --> 00:30:50.323
Isaac Wolf: You understand?

00:30:50.323 --> 00:30:50.823
David Boder: Yes.

00:30:50.823 --> 00:30:57.854
Isaac Wolf: We had gotten those...when we were given fungi [bacteria? infections? innoculations?], then as if the fungi got into the food. Like they say in Russian porok serdsa [heart disease]...

00:30:57.854 --> 00:30:58.916
David Boder: Porok serdsa, yes.

00:30:58.916 --> 00:31:11.807
Isaac Wolf: . . . one said, you understand? That I had. Many more had that. Those people who were at Stalingrad, one can say, there is one per cent who are healthy, because three months, six months, we lay wet and crowded...

00:31:11.807 --> 00:31:12.229
David Boder: Hm.

00:31:12.229 --> 00:31:14.197
Isaac Wolf: . . . the frost and the snow and everything together.

00:31:14.197 --> 00:31:15.494
David Boder: Hm. How do you feel now?

00:31:15.494 --> 00:31:25.666
Isaac Wolf: And now I am, too, in a very weak condition. When...when rain comes I can tell you a few days in advance. And now the hand also...I still have an injured hand.

00:31:25.666 --> 00:31:27.385
David Boder: A wounded hand, yes.

00:31:27.385 --> 00:31:28.697
Isaac Wolf: A wounded hand. I can’t hold it.

00:31:28.697 --> 00:31:29.712
David Boder: Hm.

00:31:29.712 --> 00:31:31.618
Isaac Wolf: That I had...

00:31:31.618 --> 00:31:33.149
David Boder: What does it mean, you can’t hold...

00:31:33.149 --> 00:31:34.165
Isaac Wolf: I can’t straighten out...

00:31:34.165 --> 00:31:36.884
David Boder: Which hand? The other one? Yes. You are not able to stretch it out, yes?

00:31:36.884 --> 00:31:42.443
Isaac Wolf: And then we went into battles. Then I was again in Vienna, too.

00:31:42.443 --> 00:31:43.537
David Boder: Yes?

00:31:43.537 --> 00:31:55.922
Isaac Wolf: I fought. And in Vienna I worked on rail...with a ship-detail, because I could not fight any more, because I was injured. But I was already in the engineer detail.

00:31:55.922 --> 00:31:56.703
David Boder: Hm.

00:31:56.703 --> 00:32:03.688
Isaac Wolf: I worked in an engineer detail, and then I was already in Hungary. And I was in Hungary till the last days of the war.

00:32:03.688 --> 00:32:06.625
David Boder: Hm. And then the Russians demobilized you?

00:32:06.625 --> 00:32:18.515
Isaac Wolf: They said...yes...that we remain till the demobilization. We were taken...that I should go home to Lemberg. I said, ‘I have nothing to look for in Lemberg, because...I can’t go there. Lemberg is a Jewish cemetery.’

00:32:18.515 --> 00:32:19.889
David Boder: Hm.

00:32:19.889 --> 00:32:20.232
Isaac Wolf: You understand?

00:32:20.232 --> 00:32:20.498
David Boder: Yes.

00:32:20.498 --> 00:32:44.779
Isaac Wolf: And I refused. ‘I don’t want to go.’ And then I said, ‘I have to take the historic staff [walking stick], like one says, the...the Eternal Wanderer’s and must begin to wander. Because I can’t come home to that house, after six years, and not find my parents...nobody at home. Then I would have to commit suicide.’ Then I went...I began again to wander.

00:32:44.779 --> 00:32:45.904
David Boder: Where did you go then?

00:32:45.904 --> 00:33:34.467
Isaac Wolf: Then I went to...from Hungary I went to Austria. In Austria I was...there were many of those I met who were in concentration camps. Many people who...when the concentration [camps] were liberated by the English and the Americans, the Jews started wandering. This one heard that he had nobody at home. What shall I go home for, said he. He began to run, to go. And many also died in the streets, because one didn’t have to eat. Then there were established Jewish commitees, that the Americans...thanks to the Americans’ aid. That was given for the...for the Jews of the lagers. They began to establish kitchens. They began to distribute shoes and suits. And hospitals and the Red Crosses. And then they began to help the Jews a little, and there were established lagers. Jewish lagers.

00:33:34.467 --> 00:33:36.014
David Boder: Hm.

00:33:36.014 --> 00:33:38.436
Isaac Wolf: The Jewish lagers were not bad where the American army was.

00:33:38.436 --> 00:33:41.124
David Boder: Where what?

00:33:41.124 --> 00:33:50.740
Isaac Wolf: Were not too bad, you understand? Were quite good. Because the Americans, when they saw the terrible...because the Germans had cut off the hair from the Jews, from the Jewish girls...

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:51.687
David Boder: Yes?

00:33:51.687 --> 00:34:12.750
Isaac Wolf: And they saw how they looked, so very bad, so there were some people who gave money, and they gave injections, and lagers were made and the Jews were put into the lagers. I myself was in Austria in a lager, where the English were. It was very bad. Why? They did not sympathize that much with the Jews.

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:13.081
David Boder: Yes?

00:34:13.081 --> 00:34:13.895
Isaac Wolf: You understand?

00:34:13.895 --> 00:34:14.540
David Boder: No compassion?

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:22.564
Isaac Wolf: Compassion, very little. There were such...there was even one who was a Jew. We knew that he was a Jew, but he did not want to admit that he is a Jew.

00:34:22.564 --> 00:34:23.257
David Boder: An Englishman?

00:34:23.257 --> 00:34:47.131
Isaac Wolf: An Englishman...a Jew. He took us to work, into the forest. We should go and chop. We told him, many of us are coming now from the army, from the lagers, we are still sick. He doesn’t care about that. We should go to work. We went to work. Then we saw that we...that death is before our eyes too [again]. We began to wander. Then we wanted to go to Italy. So the English caught us...

00:34:47.131 --> 00:34:47.975
David Boder: Hm.

00:34:47.975 --> 00:35:01.210
Isaac Wolf: . . . and we were...just like...just like the Germans, the SS. Led us with the automatics, and we were led to...back. Then we were...we were imprisoned. We sat imprisoned. That was near Villach.

00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:01.915
David Boder: Hm.

00:35:01.915 --> 00:35:17.319
Isaac Wolf: We were imprisoned, and there we sat. They wanted to return us to...concentration...there was a lager of Jews who...they took, the English...under Austrian guard we were kept by the English...

00:35:17.319 --> 00:35:18.325
David Boder: Hm.

00:35:18.325 --> 00:35:19.439
Isaac Wolf: . . . and that was...

00:35:19.439 --> 00:35:20.885
David Boder: What do you mean by ‘Austrian guards’?

00:35:20.885 --> 00:35:22.933
Isaac Wolf: Austrian sold-...police.

00:35:22.933 --> 00:35:23.927
David Boder: Were guarding the Jewish?

00:35:23.927 --> 00:35:27.180
Isaac Wolf: Were guarding the Jewish! Together with the English...

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:27.753
David Boder: Nu?

00:35:27.753 --> 00:35:45.898
Isaac Wolf: . . . and at the same time the English took, and gave the Ukranians, because they had run away from Poland, because they didn’t want to return home, because they knew that the Poles will kill them, and...and the Russians, because they were bandits, because they had killed many Jews, many Russians. So those Ukranians...

00:35:45.898 --> 00:35:46.151
David Boder: Hm.

00:35:46.151 --> 00:35:52.567
Isaac Wolf: . . . those Ukranians were the guards over the Jews. In Judenburg, too...

00:35:52.567 --> 00:35:53.302
David Boder: Where...where is that?

00:35:53.302 --> 00:36:00.091
Isaac Wolf: Austria [blank piece of wire]. That was...Judenburg is in Austria. That was the English zone, in the English...

00:36:00.091 --> 00:36:00.272
David Boder: Yes.

00:36:00.272 --> 00:36:29.605
Isaac Wolf: . . . section. The English took the Ukranians and appointed them as policemen, as police-guards. And they guarded the Jews. They didn’t let the Jews eat. When a Jew came over hungry, he wants to eat a second time, they chased him away. Because he wants another piece of bread...because they had here, under the mantle of the English, who had given them a...the authority as police, here, too, they were taking revenge. Now they took stones and threw at the Jews...

00:36:29.605 --> 00:36:30.328
David Boder: Who?

00:36:30.328 --> 00:36:31.262
Isaac Wolf: The Ukranians...

00:36:31.262 --> 00:36:31.666
David Boder: Yes?

00:36:31.666 --> 00:36:34.780
Isaac Wolf: . . . when they stood as police, as guards.

00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:34.931
David Boder: Yes.

00:36:34.931 --> 00:36:45.865
Isaac Wolf: You understand? Then they were taken as chauffeurs, and the Jews were not admitted to any jobs. The English...and then came...we were in Tropaiech [?]...Tropaya [he spells it later Trofaiach].

00:36:45.865 --> 00:36:46.570
David Boder: Where?

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:48.600
Isaac Wolf: That was a Jewish lager, too. So we...

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:49.805
David Boder: What was it called?

00:36:49.805 --> 00:36:50.660
Isaac Wolf: Trofaiach.

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:51.504
David Boder: Tropaya[?].

00:36:51.504 --> 00:36:53.203
Isaac Wolf: Yes, that isn’t far from...

00:36:53.203 --> 00:36:54.781
David Boder: Trofaiach, is that in Yiddish?

00:36:54.781 --> 00:00:00.000
Isaac Wolf: No, there is a German...that is the name of it, Trofaiach. That is a village...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:36:58.115
David Boder: Yes.

00:36:58.115 --> 00:36:59.330
Isaac Wolf: . . . not far from Judenburg.

00:36:59.330 --> 00:36:59.854
David Boder: Yes.

00:36:59.854 --> 00:37:03.777
Isaac Wolf: There was...we had a director, a Jew, a director of UNRRA.

00:37:03.777 --> 00:37:04.922
David Boder: Also a Jew?

00:37:04.922 --> 00:37:06.330
Isaac Wolf: An American.

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:06.902
David Boder: And?

00:37:06.902 --> 00:37:15.788
Isaac Wolf: He was already...he sympathized with the Jews. He did for the Jews very much. What did he do? He taught Jews to be chauffeurs.

00:37:15.788 --> 00:37:16.458
David Boder: Hm.

00:37:16.458 --> 00:37:37.735
Isaac Wolf: He taught Jews...he exerted himself to teach the Jews. He clothed them. He erected a Jewish Synagogue. He made a cinema for the Jews in the lager. And he took pains...that we immediately recognized that he is not an Englishman, he is not an English Jew, but he is an American, you understand?

00:37:37.735 --> 00:37:38.036
David Boder: Yes.

00:37:38.036 --> 00:37:47.090
Isaac Wolf: He aided the Jews a hundred per cent. So that we...I am lacking words to tell. When we came from Judenburg to Trofaiach...

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:48.690
David Boder: Yes?

00:37:48.690 --> 00:38:18.934
Isaac Wolf: . . . that was in...in...that was in November, December in the year ’45. He did so much. He clothed us. He went to Graz. He brought himself...when the Jews arrived he himself came over with the maching, himself as chauffeur. He brought the Jews over. He couldn’t see them cold. And he brought many doctors, medicines. The sick Jews were saved. The Jews were aided very much...

00:38:18.934 --> 00:38:47.423
David Boder: [In English] This concludes Spool number 100, taken at Tradate, between Milano and Como in Italy, on September 1, 1946. The interviewee is Mr. Isaac Wolf, in the Hachshara in Tradate, and we will continue with him on Spool number 101. An Illinois Institute of Technology wire recording.

00:38:47.423 --> 00:39:06.021
David Boder: [In English] September 1, 1946, Italy, camp for cooperative in Castello Tradate, between Milano and Como. Spool number 101. Mr. Isaac Wolf, interviewee, is continuing.

00:39:06.021 --> 00:39:11.292
David Boder: [In German] And so, Mr. Wolf, what are you saying about Trofaiach? Who was there in...

00:39:11.292 --> 00:39:12.004
Isaac Wolf: Trofaiach?

00:39:12.004 --> 00:39:13.091
David Boder: Trofaiach? [an interrupetd word].

00:39:13.091 --> 00:39:12.475
Isaac Wolf: In Trofaiach were the...

00:39:12.475 --> 00:39:17.727
David Boder: One moment. How do you spell Trofaiach? T...

00:39:17.727 --> 00:39:19.635
Isaac Wolf: . . . O...

00:39:19.635 --> 00:39:21.132
David Boder: Yes. F...

00:39:21.132 --> 00:39:21.905
Isaac Wolf: . . . I...

00:39:21.905 --> 00:39:23.191
David Boder: . . . I...

00:39:23.191 --> 00:39:25.201
Isaac Wolf: . . . A...CH.

00:39:25.201 --> 00:39:26.770
David Boder: Trofaiach. [Words not clear].

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:28.642
David Boder: Yes. Is that a German town?

00:39:28.642 --> 00:39:29.656
Isaac Wolf: It is an Austrian.

00:39:29.656 --> 00:39:31.588
David Boder: An Austrian town. And so, go on.

00:39:31.588 --> 00:39:34.654
Isaac Wolf: In Trofaiach we had...we saw it was very terrible...

00:39:34.654 --> 00:39:35.952
David Boder: The English were in Trofaiach?

00:39:35.952 --> 00:39:37.159
Isaac Wolf: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:39:37.159 --> 00:39:37.823
David Boder: Nu? And so?

00:39:37.823 --> 00:39:54.664
Isaac Wolf: They did not permit a Jew to leave the lager without a permit from the English. One wasn’t permitted to travel. One wasn’t permitted to go. So we said, ‘What, will we sit here? After the war we are again in a concentration camp.’ We hit the road to Italy. We were caught...

00:39:54.664 --> 00:39:56.477
David Boder: What does it mean you hit the road to Italy?

00:39:56.477 --> 00:39:58.276
Isaac Wolf: We...we...ourselves...went to Italy...

00:39:58.276 --> 00:40:00.075
David Boder: How many...how many went?

00:40:00.075 --> 00:40:02.327
Isaac Wolf: A hundred and thirty people had gathered together.

00:40:02.327 --> 00:40:02.828
David Boder: Nu?

00:40:02.828 --> 00:40:03.643
Isaac Wolf: We went [an interrupted word].

00:40:03.643 --> 00:40:08.279
David Boder: What organization was it of the [hundred] thirty people? Was it already a Kibbutz?

00:40:08.279 --> 00:40:08.901
Isaac Wolf: A Kibbutz.

00:40:08.901 --> 00:40:09.342
David Boder: A Kibbutz.

00:40:09.342 --> 00:40:09.722
Isaac Wolf: Yes.

00:40:09.722 --> 00:40:10.930
David Boder: Who organized that Kibbutz?

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:12.155
Isaac Wolf: I myself.

00:40:12.155 --> 00:40:14.479
David Boder: Have you...were you a Zionist before?

00:40:14.479 --> 00:40:24.862
Isaac Wolf: Yes. I gathered my friends, who I knew, who were with me together in the army, and such. And I have...the Kibbutz Dror Habonim.

00:40:24.862 --> 00:40:25.876
David Boder: What was the name of it?

00:40:25.876 --> 00:40:27.083
Isaac Wolf: Kibbutz Dror Habonim.

00:40:27.083 --> 00:40:27.989
David Boder: Dror Habonim?

00:40:27.989 --> 00:40:28.158
Isaac Wolf: Yes.

00:40:28.158 --> 00:40:28.550
David Boder: What does it mean?

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:42.615
Isaac Wolf: That is...’dror’...that is, a ‘Dror’ existed before in Poland. And Habonim was a Hungarian organization, and we had...that is an organization which we combined together, you understand? The youth combined together in a democratic...

00:40:42.615 --> 00:40:43.146
David Boder: Organization.

00:40:43.146 --> 00:40:43.840
Isaac Wolf: . . . organization.

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:44.414
David Boder: One moment.

00:40:44.414 --> 00:40:46.877
Isaac Wolf: Yes.

00:40:46.877 --> 00:40:49.611
David Boder: Write it down for me in Yiddish.

00:40:49.611 --> 00:40:51.030
Isaac Wolf: Oh, I can write it down in German, too.

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.440
David Boder: Yes.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.040
Isaac Wolf: Dror, oh.

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:55.213
David Boder: Who gave it the name Dror Habonim?

00:40:55.213 --> 00:41:07.135
Isaac Wolf: Nu, that have the...united...these...youth have combined. Like there was, let us say, Kibbutz Hashomer, Kibbutz, let us say...

00:41:07.135 --> 00:41:07.515
David Boder: Hm.

00:41:07.515 --> 00:41:12.888
Isaac Wolf: Such various Kibbutz...such various. They named it Kibbutz Dror Habonim.

00:41:12.888 --> 00:41:13.268
David Boder: Yes.

00:41:13.268 --> 00:41:23.711
Isaac Wolf: And we started. We saw that we have nothing to lose. After six years of war we got again into a concentration camp. It was surrounded with wires.

00:41:23.711 --> 00:41:24.001
David Boder: Yes.

00:41:24.001 --> 00:41:38.476
Isaac Wolf: You understand? And the Austrians should stand guard! Just like in a concentration camp. We did not want to allow that, and we went to Italy. We were caught...the English. We were led with automatics back...

00:41:38.476 --> 00:41:39.913
David Boder: How many people? The whole hundred...

00:41:39.913 --> 00:41:45.484
Isaac Wolf: The whole hundred fifty. There were other Jews who went, too. So that we were led back three hundred people.

00:41:45.484 --> 00:41:47.929
David Boder: How far from Trofaiach was that?

00:41:47.929 --> 00:41:53.392
Isaac Wolf: That was from Trofaiach a hundred and eighty kilometers. That was about fifteen kilometers from Villach.

00:41:53.392 --> 00:41:56.670
David Boder: So far away you were found?

00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:57.020
Isaac Wolf: Yes.

00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:57.563
David Boder: And brought back?

00:41:57.563 --> 00:00:00.000
Isaac Wolf: Yes.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:41:57.805
David Boder: Nu?

00:41:57.805 --> 00:42:03.376
Isaac Wolf: The Austrians had said that Jews are passing, so the English brought us back with automatics.

00:42:03.376 --> 00:42:03.588
David Boder: Yes.

00:42:03.588 --> 00:42:06.594
Isaac Wolf: And we were led like...like criminals.

00:42:06.594 --> 00:42:07.077
David Boder: Yes.

00:42:07.077 --> 00:42:08.363
Isaac Wolf: And we were not permitted to go out...

00:42:08.363 --> 00:42:08.623
David Boder: On foot?

00:42:08.623 --> 00:42:09.637
Isaac Wolf: On foot...

00:42:09.637 --> 00:42:10.573
David Boder: [Word not clear].

00:42:10.573 --> 00:42:20.189
Isaac Wolf: No. We were led on foot to the railroad, not far away. We were taken by train. And we jumped out of the train, and we went on again. Then the English...

00:42:20.189 --> 00:42:21.505
David Boder: How many jumped out?

00:42:21.505 --> 00:42:26.986
Isaac Wolf: Nearly all. I had everybody...till the last. While the train was moving I pushed out everybody.

00:42:26.986 --> 00:42:27.487
David Boder: How slow was the train going?

00:42:27.487 --> 00:42:30.022
Isaac Wolf: It went slowly. The train was going slow.

00:42:30.022 --> 00:42:31.622
David Boder: The engineer was going slowly?

00:42:31.622 --> 00:42:34.507
Isaac Wolf: It was not far from Villach, from the station.

00:42:34.507 --> 00:42:34.900
David Boder: Yes?

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:39.415
Isaac Wolf: It was our luck then that the...the tracks were occupied.

00:42:39.415 --> 00:42:39.687
David Boder: Yes.

00:42:39.687 --> 00:42:43.206
Isaac Wolf: And he was going slowly until he arrived in Villach...

00:42:43.206 --> 00:42:43.659
David Boder: Yes.

00:42:43.659 --> 00:42:46.876
Isaac Wolf: Because in Villach the English police was already standing there. We couldn’t anymore...

00:42:46.876 --> 00:42:47.027
David Boder: Yes.

00:42:47.027 --> 00:42:49.864
Isaac Wolf: . . . and the Austrian. It was near Villach. Then we...

00:42:49.864 --> 00:42:51.675
David Boder: But you were under English guard?

00:42:51.675 --> 00:42:53.848
Isaac Wolf: The English guards were in the other wagons, you understand?

00:42:53.848 --> 00:42:54.271
David Boder: Hm. They...

00:42:54.271 --> 00:43:01.774
Isaac Wolf: And we opened...through the windows, through the doors, they went out. Because the English guards were not in these wagons. They were in the third, fourth wagon.

00:43:01.774 --> 00:43:01.985
David Boder: Yes.

00:43:01.985 --> 00:43:03.826
Isaac Wolf: Because there were three wagons. You understand?

00:43:03.826 --> 00:43:04.098
David Boder: Talk a little slower.

00:43:04.098 --> 00:43:06.832
Isaac Wolf: A few were caught, a few Jews.

00:43:06.832 --> 00:43:07.406
David Boder: Yes.

00:43:07.406 --> 00:43:18.983
Isaac Wolf: They imprisoned them. They sat three months, two months. And we went on. We didn’t want to go to...we knew that we are being led to...to a concentration camp.

00:43:18.983 --> 00:43:19.225
David Boder: Yes?

00:43:19.225 --> 00:43:26.758
Isaac Wolf: You understand? There were many Jews...many Jews were there already imprisoned. Then we ran away, on foot, to Coblenz [the name of the locality is obviously incorrect].

00:43:26.758 --> 00:43:27.181
David Boder: Hm.

00:43:27.181 --> 00:43:32.903
Isaac Wolf: There was a lager that was newly established. There was a Jewish Lager-fuehrer, Mr. Katz...

00:43:32.903 --> 00:43:33.658
David Boder: Hm.

00:43:33.658 --> 00:43:39.079
Isaac Wolf: . . . an American. He was a...a father, a father, one can say, for the Jews there.

00:43:39.079 --> 00:43:39.671
David Boder: Yes.

00:43:39.671 --> 00:43:46.299
Isaac Wolf: And he took pains to...and all the Jews...whatever he could...we arrived in the snow...

00:43:46.299 --> 00:43:48.792
David Boder: What was the first name of Mr. Katz?

00:43:48.792 --> 00:43:49.384
Isaac Wolf: That I can’t...

00:43:49.384 --> 00:43:49.825
David Boder: But yes...

00:43:49.825 --> 00:43:50.235
Isaac Wolf: . . . exactly...

00:43:50.235 --> 00:43:50.779
David Boder: That was in Coblenz? [Name apparently incorrect.]

00:43:50.779 --> 00:00:00.000
Isaac Wolf: In Coblenz...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:43:51.250
David Boder: Yes.

00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:56.339
Isaac Wolf: That was in...in...in...let us say in March. Let us say...

00:43:56.339 --> 00:43:56.689
David Boder: Yes.

00:43:56.689 --> 00:44:04.717
Isaac Wolf: And he had...whatever he could do he did for us. He gave us shoes. He clothed us.

00:44:04.717 --> 00:44:06.094
David Boder: Was that the UNRRA?

00:44:06.094 --> 00:44:08.647
Isaac Wolf: That was already taken or...that was from the UNRRA, yes.

00:44:08.647 --> 00:44:08.889
David Boder: Yes.

00:44:08.889 --> 00:44:36.188
Isaac Wolf: And he has...always...he came over. He met us with autos. When he was told that Jews have arrived...there were no chauffeurs. So he himself would get in the car, and he drove the Jews to the lager...to his place. He registered everybody. We were given immediately to eat, and the sick put into the hospital. And he did a hundred percent that was possible, that was in his power.

00:44:36.188 --> 00:44:36.520
David Boder: Nu, yes.

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:37.915
Isaac Wolf: That he did for the Jews.

00:44:37.915 --> 00:44:38.718
David Boder: Nu?

00:44:38.718 --> 00:44:49.722
Isaac Wolf: And then we were in Villach all the time. Then Villach began to be liquidated, because they didn’t want that the Jews should be...because the Austrians had attacked the Jews...

00:44:49.722 --> 00:44:50.567
David Boder: What? Austrians [interrupted words]?

00:44:50.567 --> 00:44:51.714
Isaac Wolf: Yes, Austrians, yes.

00:44:51.714 --> 00:44:52.487
David Boder: Have what?

00:44:52.487 --> 00:44:56.972
Isaac Wolf: Saw that Jews walk in the streets. They attacked the Jews. They were beaten.

00:44:56.972 --> 00:44:58.771
David Boder: The Austrians beat the Jews?

00:44:58.771 --> 00:45:05.248
Isaac Wolf: The Austrians. I myself stood when a...a Jew went over to take some wood. There was a factory...not a factory...

00:45:05.248 --> 00:45:05.477
David Boder: Yes.

00:45:05.477 --> 00:46:01.903
Isaac Wolf: . . . but a sawmill where wood was sawed for us. Boards to make the barracks for the Jews. It was a forest, not far from the town, about three kilometers. The Germans came over and beat up the Jews, because they were taking wood there. And that wood was for the lager. But he did...and then he beat up that Jew, and the Jew remained lying. Eight days he lay sick. And we took that German, and he was brought over the lager. And we said to the English, ‘If you don’t put this man in jail, then we will consider the English the same as the German’s, and we will...we have nothing to lose, is we make that all of us should be put to death. We will, for revenge, we will beat up this German, too.’ Then took...that Mr. Katz, and he turned him over to the English police. What they did with him, the English police, I don’t know. But eight days later we saw him in town, that same Austrian. He had been released.

00:46:01.903 --> 00:46:02.597
David Boder: Hm.

00:46:02.597 --> 00:46:06.750
Isaac Wolf: And he was not living there any more, in that flat because he was already afraid of the Jews. You understand?...

00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:06.883
David Boder: Yes.

00:46:06.883 --> 00:46:39.447
Isaac Wolf: And he lived in town. The English had released him too. Then we saw that the English are...either...I don’t know how to understand it...then I didn’t know how to understand that. Either they have an understanding that the Jews should be beaten or what...And then we saw that we have nothing to lose. Food was very hard. When that Mr. Katz was there it was very good. And then there were always more people. And the concentr...the lager was transferred to another place. We were told that we will be transferred, and into a forest, between mountains. That the Jews should be separated from the city.

00:46:39.447 --> 00:46:39.779
David Boder: Hm.

00:46:39.779 --> 00:46:52.395
Isaac Wolf: Nu, I observed thus: after six years of war, with what we went through and again go into a concentration camp. And there, they were not human, why should we do that?...So we decided to go again, to Salzburg, to the American side.

00:46:52.395 --> 00:46:52.727
David Boder: Hm.

00:46:52.727 --> 00:46:54.417
Isaac Wolf: Then we came to the American side.

00:46:54.417 --> 00:46:56.319
David Boder: Did you go with permission or without?

00:46:56.319 --> 00:46:57.092
Isaac Wolf: Without permission.

00:46:57.092 --> 00:46:58.529
David Boder: How many of you went?

00:46:58.529 --> 00:46:59.815
Isaac Wolf: We were going in groups...

00:46:59.815 --> 00:47:00.286
David Boder: Hm.

00:47:00.286 --> 00:47:03.201
Isaac Wolf: We were going...I took with me seventeen people.

00:47:03.201 --> 00:47:03.352
David Boder: Hm.

00:47:03.352 --> 00:47:07.336
Isaac Wolf: With pregnant women, with children. Led them on foot over the mountains.

00:47:07.336 --> 00:47:07.910
David Boder: Nu?

00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:25.222
Isaac Wolf: Then we went over and [unintelligible]. We went there and there were already Jews, that was quite good. We were already given to eat and to drink. The American almost didn’t want to register us, but still they registered us.

00:47:25.222 --> 00:47:25.874
David Boder: Yes?

00:47:25.874 --> 00:47:27.371
Isaac Wolf: And we were given...

00:47:27.371 --> 00:47:29.864
David Boder: What did they want to do, send you back?

00:47:29.864 --> 00:47:35.013
Isaac Wolf: To send back...no. If one is caught near the border, or not far, one is put in jail. The Americans, too...

00:47:35.013 --> 00:47:35.484
David Boder: Yes?

00:47:35.484 --> 00:47:58.802
Isaac Wolf: You understand? Because if one has illegally crossed the border. We said, ‘What borders are we crossing? We are going from one lager to another. Was it wrong? Nu, why do we deserve such wrong? After six years of war...what crimes have we committed? We have remained [alive] a few Jews?’ In lagers in the Austrian zone, where the English were, the Jew did not want to be, because it was worse, like...exactly like under the German.

00:47:58.802 --> 00:47:59.333
David Boder: Nu?

00:47:59.333 --> 00:48:09.172
Isaac Wolf: Without permission one couldn’t go. Food there was little. And then we came to Salzburg. From Salzburg we went to Italy.

00:48:09.172 --> 00:48:09.776
David Boder: Where to?

00:48:09.776 --> 00:48:10.186
Isaac Wolf: Italy.

00:48:10.186 --> 00:48:11.967
David Boder: Italy. Legally or illegally?

00:48:11.967 --> 00:48:12.541
Isaac Wolf: Illegally.

00:48:12.541 --> 00:48:13.585
David Boder: Speak louder.

00:48:13.585 --> 00:48:14.913
Isaac Wolf: Illegally we went.

00:48:14.913 --> 00:48:15.426
David Boder: Nu?

00:48:15.426 --> 00:48:21.191
Isaac Wolf: And from Italy we came here. We already received aid. Also from the [interrupted words].

00:48:21.191 --> 00:48:24.227
David Boder: How can so many people cross the border illegally?

00:48:24.227 --> 00:48:30.082
Isaac Wolf: We went at night over the mountains. Three broke a leg. One broke a hand, without...without...

00:48:30.082 --> 00:48:31.772
David Boder: Didn’t you have anybody to lead you? Or...

00:48:31.772 --> 00:48:34.247
Isaac Wolf: We had one...one was leading us.

00:48:34.247 --> 00:48:35.213
David Boder: Who? An Italian?

00:48:35.213 --> 00:48:37.537
Isaac Wolf: No, that was a Greek.

00:48:37.537 --> 00:48:38.080
David Boder: Yes?

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:47.847
Isaac Wolf: We paid him money and he led. One took a watch off the hand, one had a ring, whatever people had they gave him, and he led us over the mountains.

00:48:47.847 --> 00:48:48.239
David Boder: Yes.

00:48:48.239 --> 00:48:55.000
Isaac Wolf: And over the mountains we were led. We arrived in Italy. Arriving in Italy we came to Milan.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:55.845
David Boder: To Milan, yes?

00:48:55.845 --> 00:49:01.398
Isaac Wolf: Yes. In Milan the Jewish committee began to give us aid. We were placed into the Lager
                        Cremona.

00:49:01.398 --> 00:49:02.515
David Boder: Where is that?

00:49:02.515 --> 00:49:08.099
Isaac Wolf: That is the...from Milan eighty kilometers, I believe, no more.

00:49:08.099 --> 00:49:08.992
David Boder: Yes? Nu?

00:49:08.992 --> 00:49:12.825
Isaac Wolf: We were led into Milan and there we were in a lager.

00:49:12.825 --> 00:49:13.489
David Boder: Nu?

00:49:13.489 --> 00:49:17.745
Isaac Wolf: We came into the lager, like into a stable. Cement bricks...

00:49:17.745 --> 00:49:18.699
David Boder: What?

00:49:18.699 --> 00:49:20.166
Isaac Wolf: . . . bricks...stone bricks...

00:49:20.166 --> 00:49:20.335
David Boder: Eh...

00:49:20.335 --> 00:49:20.697
Isaac Wolf: . . . without wood...

00:49:20.697 --> 00:49:22.599
David Boder: . . . under the feet?

00:49:22.599 --> 00:49:23.221
Isaac Wolf: Yes.

00:49:23.221 --> 00:49:24.326
David Boder: I mean the floor out of stone.

00:49:24.326 --> 00:49:24.676
Isaac Wolf: The floor, yes.

00:49:24.676 --> 00:49:24.918
David Boder: Was out of stone.

00:49:24.918 --> 00:49:25.521
Isaac Wolf: Yes, yes.

00:49:25.521 --> 00:49:26.837
David Boder: What was it before?

00:49:26.837 --> 00:49:31.382
Isaac Wolf: It was before and armor...an armory for soldiers.

00:49:31.382 --> 00:49:31.744
David Boder: Nu?

00:49:31.744 --> 00:49:41.825
Isaac Wolf: Nu, it was without doors, without windows. Thus we lived. In one room we lived, eighty people. My entire kibbutz was there. Together...

00:49:41.825 --> 00:49:42.326
David Boder: Nu?

00:49:42.326 --> 00:49:48.272
Isaac Wolf: And we were there. And there we went through very hard [conditions]. Cold, hungry.

00:49:48.272 --> 00:49:49.377
David Boder: Which month was it in?

00:49:49.377 --> 00:49:56.397
Isaac Wolf: It was...there...I can tell you. Four...two months ago it was.

00:49:56.397 --> 00:49:57.031
David Boder: Oh! Only two months ago?

00:49:57.031 --> 00:49:58.890
Isaac Wolf: Two months ago we left...I left Cremona.

00:49:58.890 --> 00:49:59.222
David Boder: In...in...

00:49:59.222 --> 00:00:00.000
Isaac Wolf: I was there, in Cremona...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:50:01.969
David Boder: [Words not clear].

00:50:01.969 --> 00:50:03.207
Isaac Wolf: . . . six months.

00:50:03.207 --> 00:50:08.217
David Boder: Hm. But you came to Cremona when? Approximately in what month? September, October?

00:50:08.217 --> 00:50:11.718
Isaac Wolf: No, that [words not clear]...that was different.

00:50:11.718 --> 00:50:12.050
David Boder: Nu.

00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:13.740
Isaac Wolf: In March I came!

00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:14.797
David Boder: Oh! March.

00:50:14.797 --> 00:50:18.648
Isaac Wolf: In March, yes, yes, in March I arrived. In March I came to Cremona.

00:50:18.648 --> 00:50:18.829
David Boder: Nu?

00:50:18.829 --> 00:50:22.873
Isaac Wolf: And in Cremona was...when I came it was still a little cold. You understand?

00:50:22.873 --> 00:50:24.654
David Boder: Yes [words not clear].

00:50:24.654 --> 00:50:25.046
Isaac Wolf: Yes, yes.

00:50:25.046 --> 00:50:26.374
David Boder: So, you weren’t six months in Cremona.

00:50:26.374 --> 00:50:28.638
Isaac Wolf: No. It is already...it is already now from Italy...

00:50:28.638 --> 00:50:28.819
David Boder: Hm.

00:50:28.819 --> 00:50:29.725
Isaac Wolf: . . . in Italy already six months.

00:50:29.725 --> 00:50:30.347
David Boder: Yes.

00:50:30.347 --> 00:50:31.482
Isaac Wolf: Yes. I was...

00:50:31.482 --> 00:50:33.371
David Boder: But when did you leave Austria?

00:50:33.371 --> 00:50:33.794
Isaac Wolf: From Austria...

00:50:33.794 --> 00:50:35.382
David Boder: Six, eight months ago?

00:50:35.382 --> 00:50:36.819
Isaac Wolf: Yes, I wandered...

00:50:36.819 --> 00:50:37.169
David Boder: Oh!

00:50:37.169 --> 00:50:47.642
Isaac Wolf: . . . from one city to another. I was in Innsbruck. From Innsbruck again...you believe it is so easy? From...from Austria...from the American zone to the French zone...because Innsbruck is the French zone...

00:50:47.642 --> 00:50:49.954
David Boder: No, why do you skip that? Tell it so it...

00:50:49.954 --> 00:50:50.455
Isaac Wolf: I understand...

00:50:50.455 --> 00:50:51.059
David Boder: . . . can be understood clearly.

00:50:51.059 --> 00:50:55.061
Isaac Wolf: Hm. I had...we had gone over from the American zone into the French zone.

00:50:55.061 --> 00:50:55.333
David Boder: Yes?

00:50:55.333 --> 00:51:00.482
Isaac Wolf: From the French zone we already went [to Italy], and we crossed over and there...

00:51:00.482 --> 00:51:02.160
David Boder: Were the French better?

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:06.084
Isaac Wolf: The French were wonderful. They let us go. The did not bother us.

00:51:06.084 --> 00:51:07.913
David Boder: Hm, nu?

00:51:07.913 --> 00:51:12.126
Isaac Wolf: And they had...they had compassion with us.

00:51:12.126 --> 00:51:13.002
David Boder: Hm.

00:51:13.002 --> 00:51:19.720
Isaac Wolf: They understood what the Jews went through. So they let him go. But not so...One did not have a permit, but still...

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:21.531
David Boder: Were men and women with you?

00:51:21.531 --> 00:51:22.588
Isaac Wolf: Women and children...

00:51:22.588 --> 00:51:23.119
David Boder: All kind.

00:51:23.119 --> 00:51:24.266
Isaac Wolf: . . . were also with us, eighteen year old boys.

00:51:24.266 --> 00:51:25.866
David Boder: Did you cross the mountains together?

00:51:25.866 --> 00:51:28.842
Isaac Wolf: Together, with a sixteen year old. He was with us.

00:51:28.842 --> 00:51:32.029
David Boder: What does one do when one walks? Did people converse? Or...

00:51:32.029 --> 00:00:00.000
Isaac Wolf: No, nothing! We walked so silently. We put handkerchiefs into the mouth...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:51:37.256
David Boder: Hm.

00:51:37.256 --> 00:51:39.273
Isaac Wolf: . . . that one shouldn’t notice at the border that...

00:51:39.273 --> 00:51:39.804
David Boder: Hm.

00:51:39.804 --> 00:51:40.679
Isaac Wolf: . . . that someone was going.

00:51:40.679 --> 00:51:40.921
David Boder: Hm.

00:51:40.921 --> 00:51:42.840
Isaac Wolf: My wife was a pregnant woman.

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.578
David Boder: When did you get married?

00:51:44.578 --> 00:51:52.244
Isaac Wolf: I got married in...eh...I have been married one year. In Budapest.

00:51:52.244 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: You got married in Budapest?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:51:54.055
Isaac Wolf: In Budapest I got married.

00:51:54.055 --> 00:51:55.021
David Boder: After the war?

00:51:55.021 --> 00:51:55.595
Isaac Wolf: Yes.

00:51:55.595 --> 00:51:56.036
David Boder: Did you...

00:51:56.036 --> 00:51:56.356
Isaac Wolf: During the war...

00:51:56.356 --> 00:51:57.098
David Boder: . . . know your wife from before?

00:51:57.098 --> 00:52:01.626
Isaac Wolf: No, I met her while I was still in the Russian army.

00:52:01.626 --> 00:52:06.201
David Boder: Aha. And then, how long had you known her before you got married?

00:52:06.201 --> 00:52:07.318
Isaac Wolf: Oh, three months.

00:52:07.318 --> 00:52:07.529
David Boder: Hm.

00:52:07.529 --> 00:52:09.660
Isaac Wolf: I was in the Russian army there, in Budapest...

00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:09.920
David Boder: Yes.

00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:10.300
Isaac Wolf: . . . where I met her.

00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:12.383
David Boder: Nu? Is your wife Rumanian?

00:52:12.383 --> 00:52:13.548
Isaac Wolf: A Ruman-...I mean, a Hungarian [girl].

00:52:13.548 --> 00:52:14.894
David Boder: Hungarian. Nu?

00:52:14.894 --> 00:52:25.056
Isaac Wolf: And I went along with my wife, ourselves without anything. So we arrived naked. We took nothing along, nothing. It was cold. Snow was on the mountains.

00:52:25.056 --> 00:52:25.358
David Boder: Yes.

00:52:25.358 --> 00:52:26.484
Isaac Wolf: There are rock mountains.

00:52:26.484 --> 00:52:26.864
David Boder: Yes.

00:52:26.864 --> 00:52:31.047
Isaac Wolf: And in spite of that we went. We took off the...eh...

00:52:31.047 --> 00:52:31.651
David Boder: Clothes.

00:52:31.651 --> 00:52:44.013
Isaac Wolf: Clothes. It was very hot, and people had bruised the feet. Then we came to Italy. From Italy we went to Cremona, and in Cremona we stayed for a while. Then...

00:52:44.013 --> 00:52:45.975
David Boder: Did you walk or ride?

00:52:45.975 --> 00:52:53.206
Isaac Wolf: We were also afraid to ride, because on the train police were questioning. We didn’t know the Italian language.

00:52:53.206 --> 00:52:53.569
David Boder: Yes?

00:52:53.569 --> 00:53:01.253
Isaac Wolf: Until we had entered [penetrated] for about sixty or eighty kilometers from the border, there already we boarded the train.

00:53:01.253 --> 00:53:02.159
David Boder: Yes.

00:53:02.159 --> 00:00:00.000
Isaac Wolf: And then we...we had arrived in Merano.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:53:06.101
David Boder: Nu?

00:53:06.101 --> 00:53:10.586
Isaac Wolf: And in Merano we already boarded the train. We rode till Milan.

00:53:10.586 --> 00:53:11.087
David Boder: Yes.

00:53:11.087 --> 00:53:19.115
Isaac Wolf: From Milan, since we were sent to Cremona. So we were in Cremona. And there, too, we had it very bad. Because it was bad with the food.

00:53:19.115 --> 00:53:19.568
David Boder: Hm.

00:53:19.568 --> 00:53:23.993
Isaac Wolf: The UNRRA director did not sympathize much with the Jews, in a way...

00:53:23.993 --> 00:53:24.585
David Boder: Was he a Jew or...

00:53:24.585 --> 00:53:35.861
Isaac Wolf: No, he was a...an officer, an English officer. And the UNRRA was not yet there. There still the English government gave out the food. The police...

00:53:35.861 --> 00:53:36.634
David Boder: Yes?

00:53:36.634 --> 00:53:59.922
Isaac Wolf: And then we were...We pleaded with ‘Milan’ so that we should be put into a Kibbutz, because in a Kibbutz one receives perhaps a little more. If we are a Kibbutz that wants to go to Eretz...So we were taken into Tradate, and in Tradate we are working, and we are learning shoemaking and tailoring and barbering.

00:53:59.922 --> 00:54:02.687
David Boder: Who is teaching you here, since you don’t have here an ORT school?

00:54:02.687 --> 00:54:10.039
Isaac Wolf: No. We have...one teaches the other. We have, for instance, let us say, three shoemakers. So a youth is put with them. He should learn, you understand?

00:54:10.039 --> 00:54:10.462
David Boder: Hm.

00:54:10.462 --> 00:54:12.864
Isaac Wolf: With tailors it is also the same.

00:54:12.864 --> 00:54:13.770
David Boder: Hm. One is learning from another.

00:54:13.770 --> 00:54:25.770
Isaac Wolf: One from another. A special school we don’t have. And when I was in Austria, there I had...there was that Mr. Katz. He trained during my time about sixty Jewish chauffeurs. He produced.

00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:27.098
David Boder: He trained?

00:54:27.098 --> 00:54:30.889
Isaac Wolf: Trained, and he said that there should be three carpenters, you understand?

00:54:30.889 --> 00:54:31.571
David Boder: Hm, yes.

00:54:31.571 --> 00:54:38.332
Isaac Wolf: It is possible to train twenty others. Thus it was taught. And here, I don’t know why, people can’t learn. There is no possibility...

00:54:38.332 --> 00:54:39.195
David Boder: Here in Tradate?

00:54:39.195 --> 00:54:44.688
Isaac Wolf: Yes. You saw that we had no water for a time. Also the water was provided for us, so we had very little [?].

00:54:44.688 --> 00:54:47.374
David Boder: You have here now the UNRRA or the Joint?

00:54:47.374 --> 00:54:49.940
Isaac Wolf: Here it is so. The UNRRA and Joint together.

00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:51.014
David Boder: Yes.

00:54:51.014 --> 00:54:51.799
Isaac Wolf: And...

00:54:51.799 --> 00:54:57.534
David Boder: And...tell me this. When you had arrived, were there people already here in Tradate?

00:54:57.534 --> 00:54:58.035
Isaac Wolf: Yes.

00:54:58.035 --> 00:55:09.957
David Boder: Nu, tell me a little. We Americans, or in America we know nothing about these about these Kibbutzim. How do people live here? How is it all organized?

00:55:09.957 --> 00:55:16.615
Isaac Wolf: The organization is so. We recieve from the UNRRA three thousand liras a month [per person].

00:55:16.615 --> 00:55:22.368
David Boder: Yes. That is three...that is what? A hundred liras a day.

00:55:22.368 --> 00:55:23.956
Isaac Wolf: Hundred liras a day. [The dollar at that time was worth about 700 Liras.]

00:55:23.956 --> 00:55:24.065
David Boder: Yes.

00:55:24.065 --> 00:55:26.256
Isaac Wolf: On this we have to live.

00:55:26.256 --> 00:55:30.089
David Boder: Yes. To whom is the money given and who is in charge of it?

00:55:30.089 --> 00:55:33.771
Isaac Wolf: The money is brought...is given to us by...the UNRRA sends it for us to the bank...

00:55:33.771 --> 00:55:34.242
David Boder: Yes.

00:55:34.242 --> 00:55:35.558
Isaac Wolf: And here we have a committee.

00:55:35.558 --> 00:55:36.240
David Boder: Yes?

00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:39.319
Isaac Wolf: And the committee takes care of whatever we need.

00:55:39.319 --> 00:55:39.971
David Boder: Yes?

00:55:39.971 --> 00:55:46.810
Isaac Wolf: That is so...that for provisions we can’t permit to spent more than eighty liras...

00:55:46.810 --> 00:55:47.383
David Boder: A day?

00:55:47.383 --> 00:55:48.379
Isaac Wolf: A day.

00:55:48.379 --> 00:55:49.949
David Boder: What is done with the rest?

00:55:49.949 --> 00:55:57.422
Isaac Wolf: With the rest it is so. Something is given to a sick person. Something is given to someone without shoes. Because now we don’t have any shoes. Many need them. Leather we don’t get. We don’t get any...

00:55:57.422 --> 00:56:02.329
David Boder: Nu, and when the pregnant women have...have children, who takes care of that?

00:56:02.329 --> 00:56:04.834
Isaac Wolf: That we leave to the hospital.

00:56:04.834 --> 00:56:06.947
David Boder: Hm. Who pays for it?

00:56:06.947 --> 00:56:21.193
Isaac Wolf: The hospital. The UNRRA does not give more than...the doctor told me this week that, ‘To me come sick from you. I receive them very willingly. But we have nothing,’ because the UNRRA only pays for the room.

00:56:21.193 --> 00:56:21.573
David Boder: Yes.

00:56:21.573 --> 00:56:29.149
Isaac Wolf: But for the doctors or for...for...for them they don’t pay. For the room and for food, for the few days, and they get nothing.

00:56:29.149 --> 00:56:29.891
David Boder: Nu?

00:56:29.891 --> 00:56:40.334
Isaac Wolf: Nu, I answered him, ‘What can I do for you? I have no money so that we could compensate you.’ However, we received something then. We haved human feelings, you understand?

00:56:40.334 --> 00:56:40.757
David Boder: Yes.

00:56:40.757 --> 00:56:51.912
Isaac Wolf: Then, anything that is possible, we give for sisters [nurses] there so they should take good care. There are also now two pregnant women today, and a woman who had an operation for appendicitis.

00:56:51.912 --> 00:56:53.318
David Boder: In which hospital is that?

00:56:53.318 --> 00:56:54.827
Isaac Wolf: Here in Tradate. The conditions...

00:56:54.827 --> 00:56:56.367
David Boder: What kind of hospital is that?

00:56:56.367 --> 00:56:57.743
Isaac Wolf: The cond-...It belongs to the city...

00:56:57.743 --> 00:56:58.075
David Boder: Yes.

00:56:58.075 --> 00:57:06.616
Isaac Wolf: . . . but a little...it is partly private also. But that professor, he is a decent man. He is...he has compassion for Jews, you understand?

00:57:06.616 --> 00:57:07.824
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:57:07.824 --> 00:57:20.971
Isaac Wolf: And so he placed them in the hospital. And we can’t help any more, because we have nothing ourselves. Those eighty liras a day, up to ninety if we dare, so we have to give up other...eh...

00:57:20.971 --> 00:57:21.412
David Boder: Things?

00:57:21.412 --> 00:57:25.686
Isaac Wolf: Things. For instance let us say, going to the movies or some other thing.

00:57:25.686 --> 00:57:28.994
David Boder: How is that? If someone wants to go to the movies, he get the money from you [from the Kibbutz]?

00:57:28.994 --> 00:57:33.630
Isaac Wolf: From our...out of these hundred liras that we receive. From the three thousand liras per person, you understand?

00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:33.920
David Boder: Yes.

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:39.491
Isaac Wolf: We ourselves have to...if we want to go to the movies, we have to go ourselves, organized, so that it should come out cheaper.

00:57:39.491 --> 00:57:39.823
David Boder: Hm.

00:57:39.823 --> 00:57:40.487
Isaac Wolf: You understand?

00:57:40.487 --> 00:57:40.729
David Boder: Yes.

00:57:40.729 --> 00:57:43.795
Isaac Wolf: So we can’t that either...once in two weeks or once a week.

00:57:43.795 --> 00:57:46.180
David Boder: But why can’t you get a cinema here? [Reference to possible recreational activities of UNRRA or other voluntary agencies.]

00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:51.510
Isaac Wolf: Because we don’t get it. I don’t know why. That is, if we don’t get it, we can’t get it.

00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:52.102
David Boder: Nu?

00:57:52.102 --> 00:57:57.130
Isaac Wolf: I don’t know why. In Austria, there that Mr. Katz provided. And here I don’t know why...

00:57:57.130 --> 00:58:01.174
David Boder: Nu? And how long do you think will people sit here around?

00:58:01.174 --> 00:58:06.969
Isaac Wolf: That does not depend on us. [Chuckle.] We can [even] today if they let us, we would even go on foot. Because we...

00:58:06.969 --> 00:58:08.237
David Boder: What does it mean, ‘if they let you’?

00:58:08.237 --> 00:58:09.372
Isaac Wolf: Nu, you know that we are...

00:58:09.372 --> 00:58:10.326
David Boder: [Words not clear.]

00:58:10.326 --> 00:58:14.147
Isaac Wolf: Because we are impeded by the English, by the...by the Italians...

00:58:14.147 --> 00:58:14.950
David Boder: Where would you go?

00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:34.737
Isaac Wolf: . . . who don’t let us out. Well, in general to go to Palestine. We have no other home. We have no other place to go. Where can we go? Because who can give us a guarantee that in a year, or in half a year, the same won’t happen again, like here? There was a Russian...Ukranians were here, too, in a concentration camp. Maybe you have heard...

00:58:34.737 --> 00:58:35.147
David Boder: No.

00:58:35.147 --> 00:58:37.019
Isaac Wolf: . . . near Radzimilov [?]. You haven’t heard about it?

00:58:37.019 --> 00:58:37.490
David Boder: No, no.

00:58:37.490 --> 00:58:41.764
Isaac Wolf: There was a lager, and there were Jews and Ukranians...

00:58:41.764 --> 00:58:42.506
David Boder: In Italy?

00:58:42.506 --> 00:58:54.639
Isaac Wolf: In Italy. They attacked them and four Jews were beaten to death. Two were killed on the spot, and two died in the hospital...sick...that is, remained dead, and two more were injured when they were...

00:58:54.639 --> 00:58:55.092
David Boder: Wounded?

00:58:55.092 --> 00:58:56.529
Isaac Wolf: Wounded.

00:58:56.529 --> 00:58:58.509
David Boder: How? What happened there? What kind of a lager was that?

00:58:58.509 --> 00:59:02.843
Isaac Wolf: The Ukranians. Those were Ukranians. Those who don’t want to return...

00:59:02.843 --> 00:59:03.115
David Boder: Home?

00:59:03.115 --> 00:59:14.602
Isaac Wolf: Home. Because they are afraid, because they had beaten Jews, killed them. They had robbed the Jews. They are hiding here under the English power. And the English don’t send them home.

00:59:14.602 --> 00:59:15.194
David Boder: Hm.

00:59:15.194 --> 00:59:20.343
Isaac Wolf: The Russians have already demanded many times that they should return home, and the English don’t send them home.

00:59:20.343 --> 00:59:20.753
David Boder: Yes?

00:59:20.753 --> 00:59:41.277
Isaac Wolf: And the...they are free. They have many more conveniences than the Jews. Because the Jews, when they want to go some place, they don’t permit it. You know how it is with a Jew. And they go. They don’t have to ask. And then suddenly they saw...they said, ‘What? Here there are also Jews?’ And they attacked the Jewish lager and the Jews were beaten. That was in Radzimirov [possibly a name of a Ukranian DP camp in Italy].

00:59:41.277 --> 00:59:41.989
David Boder: And the English?

00:59:41.989 --> 00:59:55.631
Isaac Wolf: The English police also got inside as if to aid the Jews a little so they would not be beaten. So they yet arrested the Jews, and the Ukranians they drove away by car so that the Jews shouldn’t...shouldn’t be able to avenge themselves for the four dead that...

00:59:55.631 --> 00:59:57.382
David Boder: They took the Ukranians away?

00:59:57.382 --> 00:59:58.758
Isaac Wolf: Took away from there.

00:59:58.758 --> 00:59:59.875
David Boder: Aha.

00:59:59.875 --> 01:00:16.100
Isaac Wolf: And the Italian police intervened and the English...and...till this day...Then we saw that it is impossible for the Jew to be together with the Ukranians. The Joint saw it. The American Joint intervened, you understand?

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:16.312
David Boder: Yes.

01:00:16.312 --> 01:00:26.743
Isaac Wolf: And the Hachshara centers were established. The UNRRA in the beginning did not want to allow to establish Hachsharas. And then Hachsharas were established so that the Jews should be separated from the...

01:00:26.743 --> 01:00:28.331
David Boder: What does it mean Hachshara?

01:00:28.331 --> 01:00:33.238
Isaac Wolf: That is a work place where Jewish Halutzim learn to work.

01:00:33.238 --> 01:00:33.540
David Boder: Yes.

01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:35.442
Isaac Wolf: We have here a little field, too.

01:00:35.442 --> 01:00:40.168
Isaac Wolf: So one teaches the other field labor, he should know how to work...

01:00:40.168 --> 01:00:45.691
David Boder: Tell me, why do you have appells twice a day, just like in a concentration camp?

01:00:45.691 --> 01:00:50.007
Isaac Wolf: No. We have an appell for the reason that we tell about the work...

01:00:50.007 --> 01:00:50.611
David Boder: Nu?

01:00:50.611 --> 01:00:55.138
Isaac Wolf: The work...we assign it one day for the next, what should be done, when it should be...

01:00:55.138 --> 01:00:57.070
David Boder: Can’t that be done in the dining hall?

01:00:57.070 --> 01:01:06.203
Isaac Wolf: No, that is...we don’t have a big enough dining hall for all the people that we have here. You see how it is with the eating here. With the eating, one shift finishes eating then the others go in.

01:01:06.203 --> 01:01:06.281
David Boder: Hm.

01:01:06.281 --> 01:01:13.434
Isaac Wolf: So that it takes from one feeding to the other a half an hour till the dishes are washed and everything.

01:01:13.434 --> 01:01:15.366
David Boder: Hm. It takes time from one...

01:01:15.366 --> 01:01:15.988
Isaac Wolf: Then, naturally...

01:01:15.988 --> 01:01:17.726
David Boder: How many people are here altogether?

01:01:17.726 --> 01:01:20.835
Isaac Wolf: Nu, now we are about six, seven hundred people.

01:01:20.835 --> 01:01:22.042
David Boder: Six, seven hundred people?

01:01:22.042 --> 01:01:23.914
Isaac Wolf: Yes, around seven hundred people.

01:01:23.914 --> 01:01:25.320
David Boder: Hm.

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:30.391
Isaac Wolf: And that is why we make appells twice daily. People are given instructions, and for discipline, too.

01:01:30.391 --> 01:01:34.242
David Boder: If it rains how will you have appells? Where will you have appells when it rains?

01:01:34.242 --> 01:01:40.248
Isaac Wolf: Nu, when it rains...so...it doesn’t rain the entire day. When it rains, it is clear in an hour, in half an hour.

01:01:40.248 --> 01:01:40.490
David Boder: Hm.

01:01:40.490 --> 01:01:42.047
Isaac Wolf: Then we go out and we...

01:01:42.047 --> 01:01:42.319
David Boder: Yes.

01:01:42.319 --> 01:01:52.719
Isaac Wolf: . . . give instructions. And if not, then we say...because there are many Kibbutzim here. There is, for instance, a Kibbutz [name of Kibbutz not clear] and, for instance, Kibbutz
                        Partisans, various ones. They are informed. They enter [?]...

01:01:52.719 --> 01:01:55.194
David Boder: Why is it called Kibbutz
                        Partisans?

01:01:55.194 --> 01:02:04.218
Isaac Wolf: That is...those who were partisans, from the army, from the Austr-...from the Russian, from the Polish, all Jews...

01:02:04.218 --> 01:02:04.430
David Boder: Yes.

01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:06.531
Isaac Wolf: . . . who were in the forests.

01:02:06.531 --> 01:02:06.821
David Boder: Hm.

01:02:06.821 --> 01:02:21.598
Isaac Wolf: They had joined the partisans. And now they are discharged from the Polish army. And they don’t have anybody at home. There were many cases that they had run away from Poland, because the Poles had attacked the Jews. They said that they don’t want to have Jews in Poland.

01:02:21.598 --> 01:02:22.220
David Boder: Hm.

01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:24.351
Isaac Wolf: They want to have a pure Polish country.

01:02:24.351 --> 01:02:24.852
David Boder: Yes.

01:02:24.852 --> 01:02:44.470
Isaac Wolf: And the Russian government intervened, the Russian police, too. Nu, you know with the Russians, it is neither a hundred per cent democratic. Also many...there are many who are from the Ukraine, and don’t like Jews either. And they help the Poles, too. There were cases in Cracow...

01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:45.182
David Boder: What is that?

01:02:45.182 --> 01:03:04.257
Isaac Wolf: Cracow, that Jews were killed, too, in the streets. One would come in to a Jew and kill him and take everything away from him. They said they don’t take the money for themselves, but for the Polish organization against the Jews, and that is why they, the Jews, have no place wherever they come. They were in Slovakia...

01:03:04.257 --> 01:03:05.905
David Boder: What kind of Polish ‘organization’ which you...

01:03:05.905 --> 01:03:07.734
Isaac Wolf: The Polish...eh...

01:03:07.734 --> 01:03:08.235
David Boder: ‘Organization.’

01:03:08.235 --> 01:03:09.201
Isaac Wolf: The Nationalists.

01:03:09.201 --> 01:03:10.336
David Boder: Oh! The Nationalists.

01:03:10.336 --> 01:03:10.897
Isaac Wolf: Nationalists.

01:03:10.897 --> 01:03:12.105
David Boder: Who were with the London Government?

01:03:12.105 --> 01:03:22.807
Isaac Wolf: Yes, yes, those who help. You understand? And that is why wherever a Jew comes he has no place [is not wanted]. If they should say, ‘I want to settle here,’ you understand...

01:03:22.807 --> 01:03:23.230
David Boder: Yes.

01:03:23.230 --> 01:03:29.345
Isaac Wolf: . . . he might settle for three days, and then he gets a letter. ‘If he doesn’t leave the place [locality] he will be killed, and...’

01:03:29.345 --> 01:03:30.993
David Boder: Where does that happen? Where does that happen?

01:03:30.993 --> 01:03:33.003
Isaac Wolf: In poland. In many villages. I spoke with...

01:03:33.003 --> 01:03:34.965
David Boder: From whom does he get the letter?

01:03:34.965 --> 01:03:37.247
Isaac Wolf: From friends...we receive...that [interrupted, words not clear].

01:03:37.247 --> 01:03:39.981
David Boder: No, I mean from whom does the Jew receive a letter?

01:03:39.981 --> 01:03:43.000
Isaac Wolf: From the Ukranians, from the Poles.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:43.622
David Boder: Yes.

01:03:43.622 --> 01:03:44.214
Isaac Wolf: You understand?

01:03:44.214 --> 01:03:44.353
David Boder: Nu?

01:03:44.353 --> 01:03:44.733
Isaac Wolf: Because [interrupted words not clear].

01:03:44.733 --> 01:03:46.001
David Boder: A letter threatening, nu?

01:03:46.001 --> 01:04:02.619
Isaac Wolf: A letter that...if he doesn’t leave the village by a certain day, then he is killed. There were such instances where one believed it is only just written, -till he became convinced that it was real. They entered at night, and he was killed, at once.

01:04:02.619 --> 01:04:04.539
David Boder: Did you see such letters?

01:04:04.539 --> 01:04:09.597
Isaac Wolf: Saw [them] myself. And I myself have a friend who requested his friends in America...

01:04:09.597 --> 01:04:09.960
David Boder: Hm.

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:21.779
Isaac Wolf: . . . that they should take him over to immigrate, because he remained one out of the entire family. And they should take him over. He had saved his life, so that now, after six years of war, he should be murdered by the...eh...

01:04:21.779 --> 01:04:22.340
David Boder: Poles.

01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:33.447
Isaac Wolf: . . . by the Poles, by the Ukranians. He has come to Italy. He waits. Maybe he will receive papers, because he himself received such a letter, too. He is now in Lager
                        Cremona.

01:04:33.447 --> 01:04:34.020
David Boder: Yes.

01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:34.805
Isaac Wolf: You understand?

01:04:34.805 --> 01:04:36.435
David Boder: And what kind of lager is there in Cremona?

01:04:36.435 --> 01:04:40.105
Isaac Wolf: Cremona is a...now it became a UNRRA
                        lager.

01:04:40.105 --> 01:04:42.338
David Boder: Nu, also of ‘Kibbutzim?’

01:04:42.338 --> 01:05:01.171
Isaac Wolf: There...there are mostly people who were...are waiting for papers [to go] to Brazil, or...So I myself posed a question, why the people who want to go to Eretz are left lying thus in Kibbutzim. None gives aid.

01:05:01.171 --> 01:05:01.735
David Boder: Hm.

01:05:01.735 --> 01:05:24.160
Isaac Wolf: You understand? And I have also demanded it. Because we want to go to Eretz. We want to work. It should not be...during the times of the war we changed. Always it was said that perhaps a Jew is too lazy to work. But that was a mistake to say so. Today’s Jews...for the youth that have remained, there is no such thing as terrible work, no matter what kind of work it is.

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:27.498
David Boder: Tell me, why doesn’t one try to work in Italy?

01:05:27.498 --> 01:05:33.836
Isaac Wolf: I will tell you. The Italian workers themselves, the natives, have no work. There is unemployment here.

01:05:33.836 --> 01:05:36.371
David Boder: There is unemployment in Italy?

01:05:36.371 --> 01:05:39.721
Isaac Wolf: In Italy also, because they have no factories.

01:05:39.721 --> 01:05:40.627
David Boder: Hm.

01:05:40.627 --> 01:05:46.319
Isaac Wolf: And the worker who does work neither makes out enough for food. I with my Kibbutz, for instance...

01:05:46.319 --> 01:05:46.591
David Boder: Yes?

01:05:46.591 --> 01:06:04.446
Isaac Wolf: . . . would like very much to go to work every day. So that I too should be able to improve my life. When I was in Cremona I saw that we can’t exist, because there was only the food that was given. Bread was given once a day, so myself, I took...I wanted to preserve my Kibbutz.

01:06:04.446 --> 01:06:04.718
David Boder: Hm.

01:06:04.718 --> 01:06:07.120
Isaac Wolf: So, I myself put on a play.

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:07.573
David Boder: Yes?

01:06:07.573 --> 01:06:15.179
Isaac Wolf: And I acted on the stage. I named the play ‘In Eretz I Found My Happiness.’

01:06:15.179 --> 01:06:15.831
David Boder: Hm.

01:06:15.831 --> 01:06:21.614
Isaac Wolf: And I put on the play three times, and I [made] a few thousand liras.

01:06:21.614 --> 01:06:22.417
David Boder: From whom?

01:06:22.417 --> 01:06:25.846
Isaac Wolf: From those people who had money. There were...

01:06:25.846 --> 01:06:26.438
David Boder: In the Lager?

01:06:26.438 --> 01:06:27.814
Isaac Wolf: There had come [people] from Milan.

01:06:27.814 --> 01:06:28.116
David Boder: What?

01:06:28.116 --> 01:06:30.832
Isaac Wolf: I had invited. From Milan there came...from Milan...

01:06:30.832 --> 01:06:31.315
David Boder: Yes.

01:06:31.315 --> 01:06:36.597
Isaac Wolf: . . . came people. There were people who received money from the...from America. You understand?

01:06:36.597 --> 01:06:37.339
David Boder: Hm.

01:06:37.339 --> 01:06:39.875
Isaac Wolf: I made out so...for the expenses that we were having.

01:06:39.875 --> 01:06:42.609
David Boder: How far is Cremona from Milan?

01:06:42.609 --> 01:06:46.110
Isaac Wolf: Cremona from Milan, that is, I believe, around eighty kilometers. I believe...

01:06:46.110 --> 01:06:46.412
David Boder: Hm.

01:06:46.412 --> 01:06:47.710
Isaac Wolf: . . . three hours by train.

01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:48.163
David Boder: Yes.

01:06:48.163 --> 01:06:58.714
Isaac Wolf: And then I made...put on a play myself. Composed about the experiences of the...of the Jews, from the beginning of the war till the end of the war.

01:06:58.714 --> 01:06:59.076
David Boder: Nu?

01:06:59.076 --> 01:07:04.056
Isaac Wolf: And it was a very nice success. And I have...and I was written up in the newspaper. I still have to this day...

01:07:04.056 --> 01:07:06.109
David Boder: In which paper? Here in...

01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:08.330
Isaac Wolf: In the Yiddish [paper]. In Baderach [On the Road]...

01:07:08.330 --> 01:07:09.598
David Boder: In the...in Milan?

01:07:09.598 --> 01:07:12.815
Isaac Wolf: In Milan. I have here...I have till this day...I have the paper.

01:07:12.815 --> 01:07:12.996
David Boder: Hm.

01:07:12.996 --> 01:07:13.992
Isaac Wolf: My name...

01:07:13.992 --> 01:07:16.226
David Boder: Where did you learn to act on the stage?

01:07:16.226 --> 01:07:21.043
Isaac Wolf: Eh...when I was still at home I have played, with youngsters by ourselves, on our own.

01:07:21.043 --> 01:07:21.604
David Boder: Yes.

01:07:21.604 --> 01:07:32.379
Isaac Wolf: And I have...there were...lawyers were there, were invited from Milan. Dr. Bernstein from Rome was there. Pardon, Professor Bernstein.

01:07:32.379 --> 01:07:32.741
David Boder: Hm.

01:07:32.741 --> 01:07:53.323
Isaac Wolf: And he also agreed that it is very well put together. And I presented that. With that I have kept up [maintained] my Kibbutz. That what I did not have the possibilities of giving them from...from the lager, the food, so I therefore made this so that I should be able to give a little more for breakfast, and to give a little more for supper, you understand?

01:07:53.323 --> 01:07:53.703
David Boder: Hm.

01:07:53.703 --> 01:07:59.498
Isaac Wolf: And I made it so I should be able to keep up the people, they shouldn’t starve.

01:07:59.498 --> 01:08:02.667
David Boder: Nu, tell me...I would like to ask you this question.

01:08:02.667 --> 01:08:03.090
Isaac Wolf: Please.

01:08:03.090 --> 01:08:17.323
David Boder: [Words not clear.] I saw this morning that you have in one section men and women, [many] married couples sleeping in the same room. How does that influence the morale of people?

01:08:17.323 --> 01:08:23.148
Isaac Wolf: Nu, I will tell you. That is already...that is...in reality that is not moral, but we have no room...

01:08:23.148 --> 01:08:25.472
David Boder: No, no, I don’t mean...I am not saying that it is not moral.

01:08:25.472 --> 01:08:25.935
Isaac Wolf: No, that is not...

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:27.082
David Boder: I ask what does it do to the state of mind?

01:08:27.082 --> 01:08:28.628
Isaac Wolf: It is very bad.

01:08:28.628 --> 01:08:29.431
David Boder: Nu?

01:08:29.431 --> 01:08:30.898
Isaac Wolf: But we have no way out.

01:08:30.898 --> 01:08:31.731
David Boder: Why not?

01:08:31.731 --> 01:08:33.801
Isaac Wolf: Because we don’t have that much room.

01:08:33.801 --> 01:08:37.876
David Boder: Can’t all the women be in one end someplace?

01:08:37.876 --> 01:08:44.594
Isaac Wolf: Nu, all right, I will tell you. One can’t take the husband...if it were for a short time, the husband could be put separately and the wife...

01:08:44.594 --> 01:08:45.470
David Boder: Yes.

01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:49.080
Isaac Wolf: . . . but when it is for a [long] time...We don’t know how long we might stay here.

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:49.400
David Boder: Oh!

01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:54.277
Isaac Wolf: One can’t put a wife separately and a husband separately. You understand? If...

01:08:54.277 --> 01:08:55.153
David Boder: Nu, tell me...

01:08:55.153 --> 01:08:55.413
Isaac Wolf: Yes.

01:08:55.413 --> 01:09:03.912
David Boder: How do they behave? I am going to ask you frank questions. A husband and a wife are living...they have relations. The other people must hear it.

01:09:03.912 --> 01:09:06.375
Isaac Wolf: Nu, I will tell you. That is...that is...

01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:07.510
David Boder: I am asking you...

01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:08.766
Isaac Wolf: Nu, yes, yes...

01:09:08.766 --> 01:09:09.599
David Boder: . . . a psychological question.

01:09:09.599 --> 01:09:14.205
Isaac Wolf: That is right. I am telling you the truth. I can tell the truth about myself.

01:09:14.205 --> 01:09:14.585
David Boder: Yes.

01:09:14.585 --> 01:09:24.937
Isaac Wolf: I was also...Now I have a small baby. I have a separate room, but until now I also lived with a pregnant wife. Also...I can tell you that we were living like strangers...

01:09:24.937 --> 01:09:25.662
David Boder: How come, like strangers?

01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:43.728
Isaac Wolf: Nu, separately, one can say, one bed near the other, and we were embarrassed one of another. You understand? Because that is not moral to have relations amid strange people. You understand? And of course it was very...like a friend told me, ‘I have a wife,’ he said, ‘but only on a picture [in my imagination.]

01:09:43.728 --> 01:09:44.151
David Boder: Hm.

01:09:44.151 --> 01:09:44.803
Isaac Wolf: ‘I can’t,’ he said, ‘with my wife.’

01:09:44.803 --> 01:09:46.330
David Boder: Hm. You mean he was living with his wife?

01:09:46.330 --> 01:09:53.845
Isaac Wolf: Of course. That is not...in a place where others are sleeping. Because we were living one bed next to the other.

01:09:53.845 --> 01:09:54.147
David Boder: Yes.

01:09:54.147 --> 01:09:56.260
Isaac Wolf: And we didn’t...one is only human.

01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:56.761
David Boder: Yes.

01:09:56.761 --> 01:10:08.230
Isaac Wolf: We can’t allow that one man should [observe] another, you understand, see...see what is going on, nu. That is why people had a saying, ‘I have a wife, but we have no relations.’

01:10:08.230 --> 01:10:10.150
David Boder: I [You] mean, they restrain themselves?

01:10:10.150 --> 01:10:11.496
Isaac Wolf: Of course.

01:10:11.496 --> 01:10:14.031
David Boder: Not that they have become used to that one...

01:10:14.031 --> 01:10:15.933
Isaac Wolf: No, not...not...not that.

01:10:15.933 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: Not that.

00:00:00.000 --> 01:10:16.766
Isaac Wolf: Not that.

01:10:16.766 --> 01:10:18.927
David Boder: You only sleep together and nothing more.

01:10:18.927 --> 01:10:22.325
Isaac Wolf: And nothing more, because that...I can’t allow that it should be thus.

01:10:22.325 --> 01:10:23.925
David Boder: Hm.

01:10:23.925 --> 01:10:27.565
Isaac Wolf: It is very terrible, such a life, but what can one do?

01:10:27.565 --> 01:10:30.963
David Boder: And the UNRRA knows it? And the others know?

01:10:30.963 --> 01:10:48.136
Isaac Wolf: I will tell you. The UNRRA comes. They come for one...for ten minutes. They look around...only that it should be clean. And when really...so I had here...they came in this week. They saw that we have no water, no lavatory, because the...the...the lavatories...the toilets are all plugged up.

01:10:48.136 --> 01:10:48.348
David Boder: Yes?

01:10:48.348 --> 01:11:16.739
Isaac Wolf: So I said, ‘Maybe you want that we should all get sick of malaria, or of typhus, or everything. They should give us some help so that we should have water.’ I said, ‘I paid once eleven thousand liras, once thirteen thousand liras and the water lasted only two, three days. The motor is Kaput [broken down].’ Nu, I can’t pay that thirteen thousand liras from the hundred liras per person that I get. The only way out is in two, three days to go on a hunger strike, or give only fifty per cent of the food.

01:11:16.739 --> 01:11:17.041
David Boder: Yes.

01:11:17.041 --> 01:11:17.584
Isaac Wolf: You understand?

01:11:17.584 --> 01:11:17.977
David Boder: Nu?

01:11:17.977 --> 01:11:23.820
Isaac Wolf: And I went to the Joint. I presented this...eh...

01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:24.544
David Boder: Situation?

01:11:24.544 --> 01:11:32.180
Isaac Wolf: Nu, yes. I was promised, and that Mr. Weitz is here. He is sick in the hospital.

01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:32.995
David Boder: Mr. Weitz.

01:11:32.995 --> 01:11:33.750
Isaac Wolf: Mr. Weitz.

01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:34.342
David Boder: Yes.

01:11:34.342 --> 01:11:36.835
Isaac Wolf: Yes. He is here. I can tell you, a friendly person.

01:11:36.835 --> 01:11:37.245
David Boder: Yes.

01:11:37.245 --> 01:11:42.527
Isaac Wolf: And he went to trouble...from the hospital, I believe, because they said that they are going to ask in the hospital.

01:11:42.527 --> 01:11:42.738
David Boder: Yes.

01:11:42.738 --> 01:11:47.386
Isaac Wolf: And he said that it should be done, and yesterday they brought...

01:11:47.386 --> 01:11:48.926
David Boder: Yes, I saw the pump. [As a matter of fact I got an automobile ride to Tradate because the new motor was being delivered. —D.P.B.]

01:11:48.926 --> 01:12:03.340
Isaac Wolf: Yes, the pump was brought. And it was brought. It...and thanks to those who took the trouble, the Joint, the American Joint, we have water today. And today we will arrange for a bath again. Because we had no water for two weeks and we couldn’t take a bath.

01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:05.755
David Boder: And so, where did one take water for washing?

01:12:05.755 --> 01:12:08.942
Isaac Wolf: They have...one had...with a cart the water was brought.

01:12:08.942 --> 01:12:09.938
David Boder: Hm. Go on.

01:12:09.938 --> 01:12:15.673
Isaac Wolf: And now we will have what to wash the laundry with, and ourselves, too, when one needs.

01:12:15.673 --> 01:12:15.993
David Boder: Hm.

01:12:15.993 --> 01:12:18.637
Isaac Wolf: Because it was very terrible. With wood it was also terrible here.

01:12:18.637 --> 01:12:20.315
David Boder: Yes? How?

01:12:20.315 --> 01:12:30.064
Isaac Wolf: Yes. The wood comes out from the subsidy that we receive, the hundred liras. The wood is deducted. A meter of wood, hundred kilos, cost three hundred liras.

01:12:30.064 --> 01:12:31.893
David Boder: Hm. What will be done in the winter?

01:12:31.893 --> 01:12:35.774
Isaac Wolf: That I don’t know. I can imagine the situation when winter comes here, and we [words not clear].

01:12:35.774 --> 01:12:38.762
David Boder: And the beds and the blankets? Were these given to you?

01:12:38.762 --> 01:12:43.320
Isaac Wolf: That was here. That has come already from...from the Joint, from UNRRA. That was already here.

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:46.598
David Boder: Yes, but you are not given bed sheets nor towels?

01:12:46.598 --> 01:12:56.485
Isaac Wolf: That we don’t have. No towels. For soap I have to run a few times till I can get it. That too we don’t have enough of. No soap, and about food you can see yourself.

01:12:56.485 --> 01:13:00.409
David Boder: Now tell me, are there not some people who get sent something from America?

01:13:00.409 --> 01:13:03.053
Isaac Wolf: There are some people, but not in the Kibbutz...

01:13:03.053 --> 01:13:03.856
David Boder: Do they get...

01:13:03.856 --> 01:13:18.995
Isaac Wolf: Those who receive from America, for instance, sit there in the lager and live on it. But in a Kibbutz generally, very...only the exact...there are some comrades who receive two dollars, or some such in letters. He gives it to the Kibbutz.

01:13:18.995 --> 01:13:20.945
David Boder: He gives it to the Kibbutz?

01:13:20.945 --> 01:13:21.748
Isaac Wolf: Yes! Yes! [With emphasis.] I myself had a friend...[interrupted].

01:13:21.748 --> 01:13:23.426
David Boder: You mean he cannot posses any money?

01:13:23.426 --> 01:13:37.883
Isaac Wolf: No. We have no money. I will tell you. Those people who are in a Kibbutz, they say that another comrade is to him the same as himself. There is no difference. Oh, I have a comrade. Let us say he has received five dollars. He has received them in a letter.

01:13:37.883 --> 01:13:38.324
David Boder: Yes?

01:13:38.324 --> 01:13:44.891
Isaac Wolf: And a package. So he gave it...he had received chocolate. So he said it should be distributed among the children.

01:13:44.891 --> 01:13:45.525
David Boder: What?

01:13:45.525 --> 01:13:50.113
Isaac Wolf: And we...so...

01:13:50.113 --> 01:13:51.851
David Boder: Hm.

01:13:51.851 --> 01:13:52.546
Isaac Wolf: We live thus.

01:13:52.546 --> 01:14:01.588
David Boder: And so, the Kibbutz is really...really a [pause], one can say a communistic organization?

01:14:01.588 --> 01:14:01.920
Isaac Wolf: No!

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:05.844
David Boder: No, I mean in management. You own everything jointly.

01:14:05.844 --> 01:14:07.341
Isaac Wolf: Everything jointly. I am telling you...

01:14:07.341 --> 01:14:08.929
David Boder: I didn’t mean politically.

01:14:08.929 --> 01:14:10.124
Isaac Wolf: [Chuckle.] Naturally.

01:14:10.124 --> 01:14:12.026
David Boder: Let us say like a cooperative.

01:14:12.026 --> 01:14:17.507
Isaac Wolf: Oh Yes. We have, for instance, religious [people] here. So we have a kosher kitchen, too.

01:14:17.507 --> 01:14:17.978
David Boder: Yes?

01:14:17.978 --> 01:14:18.690
Isaac Wolf: You understand?

01:14:18.690 --> 01:14:19.203
David Boder: Yes.

01:14:19.203 --> 01:14:29.827
Isaac Wolf: And we have a common kitchen. If we should all want to eat Kosher like one says, we could not exist. Because a kilo of meat costs three hundred liras, three hundred and fifty liras.

01:14:29.827 --> 01:14:30.551
David Boder: A kilo of Kosher meat?

01:14:30.551 --> 01:14:32.755
Isaac Wolf: No, the ordinary...cow...

01:14:32.755 --> 01:14:33.437
David Boder: Yes.

01:14:33.437 --> 01:14:37.240
Isaac Wolf: When we had gotten the three thousand liras, a kilo of meat was...

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:37.439
David Boder: Yes.

01:14:37.439 --> 01:14:45.739
Isaac Wolf: . . . was two hundred and fifty. And now [it] costs three hundred and fifty. And we always get exactly the three thousand liras. A raise we don’t get.

01:14:45.739 --> 01:14:46.813
David Boder: Hm.

01:14:46.813 --> 01:14:56.230
Isaac Wolf: And we have a kosher kitchen in the same manner. Everyone lives collectively. Because if not collectively we cannot exist.

01:14:56.230 --> 01:15:07.143
David Boder: Nu, Mr. Wolf, everything was very interesting and everything very important. I think that you have told me a good story.

01:15:07.143 --> 01:15:08.502
Isaac Wolf: I am telling you the truth [words not clear].

01:15:08.502 --> 01:15:42.804
David Boder: Well, yes, that is what I am saying. You gave me a good report and many a thing has become clear, and many things will become clearer to the people who will study this document. I thank you very much.

01:15:42.804 --> 01:15:41.831
David Boder: [In English] This concludes Spool 101, the second spool of Mr. Isaac Wolf who is an officer in one of the Kibbutzim at Camp Tradate, between Como and Milan. Illinois Institute of Technology wire recording. September the 1st, 1946.
