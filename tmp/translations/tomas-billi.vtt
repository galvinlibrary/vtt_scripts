00:00:00.783 --> 00:00:38.469
David Boder: [In English] September the 21st, 1946, a displaced persons’ camp for Baltics—Latvians, Lithuanians and Estonians—near, in the environment of Munich, Camp Lohengrinstrasse. The interviewee is Tomas Billi, a Estonian, similar to the woman who, ah, a compatriot of the woman, Mrs. Anna Paul, which we heard before.Anna Paul was also interviewed by Boder on September 21st at Lohengrinstrasse, on Spools 9-140B and 9-141A.1 Only he prefers to speak Russian, and so Russian we speak.

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:53.722
David Boder: [In Russian] Well, Mr. Billi, tell us what is your full name, how old you are and where you were born? [Some weak instructions from Boder, most likely about use of microphone.]

00:00:53.722 --> 00:01:05.275
Tomas Billi: My name is Tomas Billi and I was born in the city of Wittenberg in Estonia in 1888.It is unclear exactly what location Billi is referring to. The most likely location is Wittenberg, which was the German name for the city of Nivenskoye, about sixteen kilometers south of Kaliningrad. This territory is currently within the Kaliningrad Oblast, a Russian exclave between Poland and Lithuania on the Baltic Sea, but at the time of Billi’s birth it was part of Prussia.2

00:01:05.275 --> 00:01:07.534
David Boder: Yes. So that means you are fifty-eight years old now.

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:09.101
Tomas Billi: I am fifty-eight.

00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:12.185
David Boder: So. What was your profession?

00:01:12.185 --> 00:01:18.179
Tomas Billi: I was a textile person by profession.

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:19.143
David Boder: A textile worker.

00:01:19.143 --> 00:01:19.956
Tomas Billi: A worker.

00:01:19.956 --> 00:01:30.649
David Boder: So. Well, tell me what and where you were and what happened to you when the Russians returned to Estonia.

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:37.922
Tomas Billi: I was working in the city of Narva. The city is located right on the Russian border...

00:01:37.922 --> 00:01:39.127
David Boder: So.

00:01:39.127 --> 00:01:47.621

00:01:47.621 --> 00:01:48.163
David Boder: So.

00:01:48.163 --> 00:01:52.742
Tomas Billi: They started [basing?] in our factory.

00:01:52.742 --> 00:01:53.989
David Boder: [interrupts] They started [basing?], right?

00:01:53.989 --> 00:02:06.501
Tomas Billi: Yes. As with all the other plants. But I still stayed there working under the Soviet authorities.

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:09.905
David Boder: So. And to whom did the plant belong originally?

00:02:09.905 --> 00:02:14.194
Tomas Billi: It was a joint stock company. It belonged to the Estonians

00:02:14.194 --> 00:02:16.032
David Boder: So.

00:02:16.032 --> 00:02:26.436
Tomas Billi: There, and...I also was included there in this factory. I also had a small number of shares.

00:02:26.436 --> 00:02:27.713
David Boder: Aha.

00:02:27.713 --> 00:02:39.791
Tomas Billi: But, anyhow, the Bolsheviks left me working there, too, because they didn’t have any, how do you say it...ah...

00:02:39.791 --> 00:02:40.454
David Boder: Specialists.

00:02:40.454 --> 00:02:42.502
Tomas Billi: . . . specialists.

00:02:42.502 --> 00:02:47.502
David Boder: So...And then, what else happened?

00:02:47.502 --> 00:02:57.383
Tomas Billi: I was working there almost until they left, when they already, when the Germans arrived.

00:02:57.383 --> 00:03:06.190
David Boder: So...So. Well, what was it like for you under the Bolsheviks? What kind of changes occurred in your personal life? Were there any kind of changes?

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:21.908
Tomas Billi: There were huge changes. They began to take various people out of Estonia. For any, to Russia, for backbreaking work.

00:03:21.908 --> 00:03:26.848
David Boder: Why for backbreaking work? [Unintelligible] [there had to be?] public work, didn’t there?

00:03:26.848 --> 00:03:29.709
Tomas Billi: So, it was said that they were sending [them] to Siberia—

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.637
David Boder: [interrupts] Well, okay. And so?

00:03:31.637 --> 00:03:46.487
Tomas Billi: Vehicles came through our border city with villagers from all over Estonia because they had to be right on the border.

00:03:46.487 --> 00:03:48.638
David Boder: Aha.

00:03:48.638 --> 00:03:57.536
Tomas Billi: And they also began arresting people all the time at night in our city.

00:03:57.536 --> 00:03:57.849
David Boder: So.

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.403
Tomas Billi: and taking [them]...

00:04:01.403 --> 00:04:02.277
David Boder: to Russia.

00:04:02.277 --> 00:04:03.283
Tomas Billi: to Russia, right.

00:04:03.283 --> 00:04:06.175
David Boder: And did they take them with their families or alone? How was it?

00:04:06.175 --> 00:04:16.127
Tomas Billi: [All of them?] the women were special, they took the children from the parents and they [unintelligible] the men onto special [rail] cars.

00:04:16.127 --> 00:04:17.525
David Boder: Hm-mmm. So.

00:04:17.525 --> 00:04:22.145
Tomas Billi: So, and this all happened all night.

00:04:22.145 --> 00:04:22.597
David Boder: Hm-mmm.

00:04:22.597 --> 00:04:26.091
Tomas Billi: . . . they organized one street every night.

00:04:26.091 --> 00:04:26.694
David Boder: Hm-mmm.

00:04:26.694 --> 00:04:53.741
Tomas Billi: Well, then we were afraid and all the people began to look for other apartments for themselves, and we people had several apartments there. I, for example, had 3 apartments for myself in the city. One night I would sleep in this apartment, the next night I went again to another, because I was afraid to spend the night in my room.

00:04:53.741 --> 00:04:54.133
David Boder: Aha.

00:04:54.133 --> 00:05:05.711
Tomas Billi: And this, we heard via these drivers which street they would be taking captive at night, for example.

00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:07.609
David Boder: How did the drivers learn this?

00:05:07.609 --> 00:05:15.452
Tomas Billi: They would tell them that they were supposed to assemble on such-and-so a street at twelve o’clock.

00:05:15.452 --> 00:05:17.199
David Boder: And the drivers were Estonians?

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:18.404
Tomas Billi: They were Estonians, yes.

00:05:18.404 --> 00:05:18.826
David Boder: Aha.

00:05:18.826 --> 00:05:19.651
Tomas Billi: So.

00:05:19.651 --> 00:05:23.868

Tomas Billi: A family was the same.

00:05:25.465 --> 00:05:27.495
David Boder: Well, how many people were in your family?

00:05:27.495 --> 00:05:28.851
Tomas Billi: Four people.

00:05:28.851 --> 00:05:30.098

David Boder: They took him?

00:05:40.441 --> 00:05:41.917
Tomas Billi: . . . they took him and sent him away.

00:05:41.917 --> 00:05:42.971
David Boder: And his wife?

00:05:42.971 --> 00:05:48.694
Tomas Billi: His wife, his wife was working elsewhere, they didn’t capture his wife this time.

00:05:48.694 --> 00:05:51.044
David Boder: So. And where is your son-in-law now?

00:05:51.044 --> 00:05:53.164

00:05:58.255 --> 00:06:02.996
David Boder: So. Well, now tell me what it was like when the Germans arrived.

00:06:02.996 --> 00:06:20.147
Tomas Billi: Then the Germans arrived, and anyhow at first we were glad that our saviors were coming. But then they behaved just like the Soviets, too.

00:06:20.147 --> 00:06:26.213
David Boder: So. And tell me, your factory that the Soviets had taken, did they give it back to—

00:06:26.213 --> 00:06:27.990
Tomas Billi: [interrupts] Well. They didn’t give anything back.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.135
David Boder: Did the Germans [leave?], too—

00:06:29.135 --> 00:06:38.876
Tomas Billi: [interrupts] It was the same, they designated their own [unintelligible] command there and, and, and [took away?] everything with their own hands.

00:06:38.876 --> 00:06:40.153
David Boder: So.

00:06:40.153 --> 00:06:43.045

David Boder: Who destroyed it?

00:06:52.136 --> 00:06:55.341
Tomas Billi: A, it was the Soviets, with airplanes.

00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:56.166
David Boder: They destroyed everything with airplanes?

00:06:56.166 --> 00:07:06.196
Tomas Billi: The Soviet assault [began in Russia?] for the reason it was supposed to be by order of the Germans to go on [the attack?].Possibly he means that the Soviets were preempting a German attack.3

00:07:06.196 --> 00:07:08.124
David Boder: And to be evacuated.

00:07:08.124 --> 00:07:08.968
Tomas Billi: To be evacuated, right.

00:07:08.968 --> 00:07:11.540
David Boder: Okay. But here, no one wanted to evacuate?

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.685

00:08:49.797 --> 00:08:56.767
David Boder: Aha. Well, and you then were working on the land. How long did this continue?

00:08:56.767 --> 00:09:06.297

00:10:51.779 --> 00:10:53.448
David Boder: Did [he pay you for?] the work?

00:10:53.448 --> 00:10:56.081

Tomas Billi: It was the Americans [who] [suddenly?] arrived here with a car at the village...

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:37.752
David Boder: So.

00:12:37.752 --> 00:13:00.113
Tomas Billi: and then we went to meet them happily and we told them that they [departure? sounds like German “aus”]. [Mumbles] Well, the Germans [correcting himself] the foreigners, not to work any more with the Germans, and the Germans were supposed to feed us.

00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:00.746
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:00.746 --> 00:13:06.511
Tomas Billi: Well, [we?] [unintelligible] he wasn’t such a bad boss, so we worked [more?]

00:13:06.511 --> 00:13:09.312
David Boder: Aha. Well, you didn’t work so much?

00:13:09.312 --> 00:13:14.132
Tomas Billi: Well, for the time being we started [locally?] to demand bet[ter], more food.

00:13:14.132 --> 00:13:14.825
David Boder: So.

00:13:14.825 --> 00:13:24.132
Tomas Billi: [We demanded milk?] one [handful?] more and so that the family would be able to eat. Well, they [can?] then [have added?] for us, too.

00:13:24.132 --> 00:13:25.541
David Boder: So.

00:13:25.541 --> 00:13:29.577
Tomas Billi: In the meantime there was an order to come here, ah, to the camp.

00:13:29.577 --> 00:13:31.655
David Boder: And there was an order for you to come here to the camp?

00:13:31.655 --> 00:13:32.107
Tomas Billi: Yes, yes.

00:13:32.107 --> 00:13:34.517
David Boder: Well, and what do you do here in the camp?

00:13:34.517 --> 00:13:43.746
Tomas Billi: My family [and I were here?], I will be in Germany, I was working, [at the] factory there [everyone] has a [wasting?] disease.

00:13:43.746 --> 00:13:44.391
David Boder: So.

00:13:44.391 --> 00:13:49.463
Tomas Billi: And considering the disease, I worked for the farmer [even more?].

00:13:49.463 --> 00:13:50.036
David Boder: So.

00:13:50.036 --> 00:13:59.536
Tomas Billi: And here now, up to now I am not doing such [difficult?] work, only suddenly [it] is involved with gardening, I will be in charge.

00:13:59.536 --> 00:14:00.078
David Boder: Mm-mmm.

00:14:00.078 --> 00:14:09.295
Tomas Billi: And we have a camp field here and [in this?] field I have also been in charge [and] we put in potatoes for the camp. And I always was [in charge?] of this business.

00:14:09.295 --> 00:14:10.753
David Boder: Aha. [You?] were in charge as the boss?

00:14:10.753 --> 00:14:11.759
Tomas Billi: As the boss, right.

00:14:11.759 --> 00:14:16.036
David Boder: Well, and what do you think? Where will you go? [Unintelligible] it will end [for you?]?

00:14:16.036 --> 00:14:20.494
Tomas Billi: Well, it’s difficult to say.

00:14:20.494 --> 00:14:22.133
David Boder: What do you want to do?

00:14:22.133 --> 00:14:29.404
Tomas Billi: Yes. We all think that if we cannot go home then we will have to start work here in Germany.

00:14:29.404 --> 00:14:32.567
David Boder: Ah, you...Why can’t you go home?

00:14:32.567 --> 00:14:44.507
Tomas Billi: Ah, because of...because of the bad regime we don’t want to go back [any more?]. We have suffered from these two regimes twice already.

00:14:44.507 --> 00:14:44.941
David Boder: I don’t want to—

00:14:44.941 --> 00:14:53.959
Tomas Billi: [interrupts] No...There is no way I want to go home...We had a good democratic government—

00:14:53.959 --> 00:15:00.827
David Boder: [interrupts] Well, there wasn’t a democratic regime. Of your...the president was already such a dictator as [Ulman?], as Stalin...as...

00:15:00.827 --> 00:15:04.905
Tomas Billi: No, no...No, we had a democratic—

00:15:04.905 --> 00:15:06.231
David Boder: [interrupts] What do you have? Was the parliament yours?

00:15:06.231 --> 00:15:08.050
Tomas Billi: The parliament [was] ours?

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:11.665
David Boder: Well, and why didn’t they put the communists into [prison?]?

00:15:11.665 --> 00:15:21.767
Tomas Billi: Well, if they, how do you say [to death already?] correctly, to require order in Estonia.

00:15:21.767 --> 00:15:30.864
David Boder: Aha. So. Eh, well, and you think that it may be possible for you to remain in Germany?

00:15:30.864 --> 00:15:33.948
Tomas Billi: Well, if...I think, that there will be a possibility.

00:15:33.948 --> 00:15:35.635
David Boder: Don’t you have any relatives in America?

00:15:35.635 --> 00:15:36.629

Tomas Billi: Ah, fifty-eight— [stops before finishing]

00:15:51.429 --> 00:15:59.154

David Boder: Mm-mmm.

00:16:13.631 --> 00:16:27.366
Tomas Billi: And to set up something else raising cattle and raising pigs or poultry breeding, I understand all this.

00:16:27.366 --> 00:16:27.607
David Boder: So.

00:16:27.607 --> 00:16:29.987
