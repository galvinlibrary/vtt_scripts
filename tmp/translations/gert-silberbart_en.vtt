00:00:00.181 --> 00:00:13.491
David Boder: [Knocking sound] [In German] In this direction is shown, you only have to, here, but, eh, come a little closer, eh, there. Say one, two, three. Here.

00:00:13.491 --> 00:00:15.441
Gert Silberbart: One, two, three.

00:00:15.441 --> 00:00:16.153
David Boder: Louder?

00:00:16.153 --> 00:00:17.572
Gert Silberbart: One, two, three.

00:00:17.572 --> 00:00:23.355
David Boder: Yes, so, now watch, when the light lights up here...

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:41.059
David Boder: [In English] Geneva, August the 27th, 1946. A recording at the home for displaced boys, predominantly Buchenwald children, who are now being trained for a profession. The interviewee is Gert Silverberg [incorrect], eh, a native of Berlin.

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.526
David Boder: [In German] So, Gert, tell us again your full name, how old are...?

00:00:45.526 --> 00:00:46.552
Gert Silberbart: Gert Silberbart.

00:00:46.552 --> 00:00:46.884
David Boder: Yes?

00:00:46.884 --> 00:00:49.587
Gert Silberbart: Gert Silberbart, and I will be 18 years old this week.

00:00:49.587 --> 00:00:59.879
David Boder: You will be 18 years old this week. Now, tell us, Gert, when did it start to go bad for you? Because things were bad for you before the war already.

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:23.177
Gert Silberbart: Yes, yes, certainly, but until the year 1938, until the shooting of of this diplomat, in French, in France we did not perceive as much of the Hitler regime, of course, a little, but it was not that much. And then, when this pogrom started on November 8, all Jewish businesses and factories were closed, the Jews were forced to wear their Jewish Stars...

00:01:23.177 --> 00:01:23.406
David Boder: Yes.

00:01:23.406 --> 00:01:32.793
Gert Silberbart: . . . and of course that attracted attention and the Hitler Youth and all the other simple Nazis, they used that and it happened often that we were attacked in the street.

00:01:32.793 --> 00:01:39.511
David Boder: So, now, tell us again, Gert, who was in your family, how many were there in your family?

00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:47.630
Gert Silberbart: We were five at first, but my brother died before the war of diphteria, so that only four of us were left, my father, my mother, my little sister, and I.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.666
David Boder: Yes. And, eh, what was your father’s profession?

00:01:53.666 --> 00:02:00.142
Gert Silberbart: My father had a large clothing factory which he then had to sell...[noise]

00:02:00.142 --> 00:02:10.343
David Boder: So, eh, you say, the difficulties began when [vom] Rath was murdered by Grünspan in Paris, right...

00:02:10.343 --> 00:02:10.645
Gert Silberbart: Yes. Yes.

00:02:10.645 --> 00:02:13.543
David Boder: Do you have any idea what happened after that?

00:02:13.543 --> 00:02:24.758
Gert Silberbart: We had no idea of that, when the whole story broke we were already in the concentration camp and had no opportunity to read any papers, [or] to get an idea what was going on out there.

00:02:24.758 --> 00:02:30.945
David Boder: Yes. So, eh, one has, you say, the pogroms started...

00:02:30.945 --> 00:02:31.247
Gert Silberbart: Yes.

00:02:31.247 --> 00:02:33.903
David Boder: What kind of pogroms were they, could you describe them if you can remember?

00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:36.951
Gert Silberbart: Well, I can describe in general...

00:02:36.951 --> 00:02:41.295
David Boder: Well, describe it in detail, and in, eh, in detail, you know...

00:02:41.295 --> 00:02:41.796
Gert Silberbart: Ok.

00:02:41.796 --> 00:02:42.581
David Boder: So.

00:02:42.581 --> 00:03:01.734
Gert Silberbart: The businesses, the display windows were smashed that night and in the following nights, by stones, and often caricatures were put on the windows. Jewish apartments were broken into and many Jews were harrassed in the street.

00:03:01.734 --> 00:03:05.042
David Boder: Yes. [knock] Now, you were just 10 years old, right?

00:03:05.042 --> 00:03:06.630
Gert Silberbart: I was 10 years old back then, yes.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.205
David Boder: And how have you—what happened to you and your family?

00:03:11.205 --> 00:03:15.220
Gert Silberbart: Well, a short time after that, our schools were closed for a while...

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.140
David Boder: Which, what do you mean with our schools?

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.146
Gert Silberbart: The Jewish schools, that pupils attended together in Berlin—

00:03:20.146 --> 00:03:20.901
David Boder: So the—yes?

00:03:20.901 --> 00:03:32.490
Gert Silberbart: And we dared not to go into the street because we did not want to risk to be attacked and beaten by the Hitler youth gangs, and also, hardly any Jew dared to cross the street in the days following this event.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.873
David Boder: Yes. And?

00:03:35.873 --> 00:03:37.956
Gert Silberbart: That was pretty much it, what we...

00:03:37.956 --> 00:03:41.958
David Boder: Yes, and what happened to your father, because, with the business of your father?

00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.493
Gert Silberbart: My father was immediately forced to sell his business.

00:03:44.493 --> 00:03:45.580
David Boder: To whom?

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.866
Gert Silberbart: To an Aryan, to a client.

00:03:46.866 --> 00:03:49.721
David Boder: Yes. Did he, did he pay you at least?

00:03:49.721 --> 00:03:58.250
Gert Silberbart: Yes, of course not the adequate amount which he would have, would have yielded under normal circumstances, but he was paid a certain sum.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.268
David Boder: Yes—and this he could dispose of, or did he have to...

00:04:01.268 --> 00:04:09.508
Gert Silberbart: Not either, instead one had to have it transferred to the bank, to the bank, and then could only take out a small amount each month.

00:04:09.508 --> 00:04:12.152
David Boder: Yes, and then, what happened to the family?

00:04:12.152 --> 00:04:17.482
Gert Silberbart: Then, we were all deported to Auschwitz, in February of ’43, we were all deported to Ausschwitz.

00:04:17.482 --> 00:04:19.552
David Boder: Where is Auschwitz, where is that situated anyway?

00:04:19.552 --> 00:04:28.788
Gert Silberbart: Auschwitz is in Upper Silesia, the Polish little town of Oświęcim. So, there, the largest concentration camp was built shortly after the Germans marched in.

00:04:28.788 --> 00:04:31.190
David Boder: Aha, so it was Poland before?

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.583
Gert Silberbart: Yes, yes.

00:04:31.583 --> 00:04:37.366
David Boder: And then, after the Germans marched in, there was a concentration camp built there, right...

00:04:37.366 --> 00:04:37.927
Gert Silberbart: Yes.

00:04:37.927 --> 00:04:41.217
David Boder: Now, how—was the whole family sent to Auschwitz?

00:04:41.217 --> 00:04:44.145
Gert Silberbart: Yes, we came, up until Auschwitz we were all together.

00:04:44.145 --> 00:04:44.525
David Boder: Yes.

00:04:44.525 --> 00:04:58.952
Gert Silberbart: . . . and [then] we were separated. My mother, my father and my little sister [noise] went, what I assume, straight for the gas chambers, while I, as the youngest, was meant to be among the living because I could work, was able to work.

00:04:58.952 --> 00:05:07.451
David Boder: Now wait a little. Where were—you were arrested in Berlin. Where were you then, from your home, how did you go to Auschwitz?

00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:10.016
Gert Silberbart: Yes.

00:05:10.016 --> 00:05:10.620
David Boder: When you went?

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:22.511
Gert Silberbart: We were arrested by the Gestapo on the night of the 7th to the 8th of March 1943 at our apartment directly in Berlin, and went directly to a camp in Berlin. We stayed there until...

00:05:22.511 --> 00:05:23.793
David Boder: Where was that camp?

00:05:23.793 --> 00:05:30.554
Gert Silberbart: In Berlin, in the Große Hamburger Straße, that was a former school where all furniture had been removed and matresses had been put in the rooms.

00:05:30.554 --> 00:05:33.138
David Boder: Yes, and the whole family was together?

00:05:33.138 --> 00:05:34.424
Gert Silberbart: There we were still together.

00:05:34.424 --> 00:05:35.649
David Boder: Men, women and children together?

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:36.072
Gert Silberbart: Yes.

00:05:36.072 --> 00:05:36.482
David Boder: Yes.

00:05:36.482 --> 00:05:38.203
Gert Silberbart: Yes, the whole families were not separated yet.

00:05:38.203 --> 00:05:39.549
David Boder: Yes. And then?

00:05:39.549 --> 00:05:49.448
Gert Silberbart: Then, on the next morning, we were, we received something to eat, and then we were loaded into moving vans, and transported to the station [noise] near Berlin.

00:05:49.448 --> 00:05:54.066
David Boder: So, now tell me, what things were you allowed to take along?

00:05:54.066 --> 00:05:59.891
Gert Silberbart: We were allowed to take along what we wanted, but at the arrival in Auschwitz everything was taken from us, except for the...

00:05:59.891 --> 00:06:02.064
David Boder: Yes, and what happened to the apartment?

00:06:02.064 --> 00:06:11.471
Gert Silberbart: Yes, we were, and that, I don’t know anymore, I only know that the Gestapo men put a Gestapo seal on after we left the apartment so that nobody was allowed to enter.

00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:17.344
David Boder: Aha. Now, and so, after so, eh—how many days did the train take to Auschwitz?

00:06:17.344 --> 00:06:18.461
Gert Silberbart: Three days.

00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:19.686
David Boder: In what kind of car did you ride?

00:06:19.686 --> 00:06:22.886
Gert Silberbart: In a cattle car, with eighty men in a cattle car, with—

00:06:22.886 --> 00:06:24.232
David Boder: The family together?

00:06:24.232 --> 00:06:26.345
Gert Silberbart: Yes, women, children, men, all together.

00:06:26.345 --> 00:06:28.083
David Boder: So, were you with your brother?

00:06:28.083 --> 00:06:30.407
Gert Silberbart: No, with my little sister and with my parents together.

00:06:30.407 --> 00:06:31.464
David Boder: With your parents together.

00:06:31.464 --> 00:06:31.784
Gert Silberbart: Yes.

00:06:31.784 --> 00:06:36.058
David Boder: And, eh, did the train, did the train stop?

00:06:36.058 --> 00:06:49.326
Gert Silberbart: The train stopped often along the way, but that had no impact on us. It was just that something stopped, but the cars were not opened until we came to Auschwitz. They were—and even there we stood for half an hour untill the SS men with the...

00:06:49.326 --> 00:06:52.181
David Boder: So how were you using toilets then, with, eh, eh...

00:06:52.181 --> 00:07:00.149
Gert Silberbart: Well, there were buckets, buckets put in the cars, that we could then empty to the outside through little cracks...

00:07:00.149 --> 00:07:03.004
David Boder: Yes. And, eh, was there drinking water...

00:07:03.004 --> 00:07:07.260
Gert Silberbart: We were supplied one bucket but that hardly lasted for one day.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.723
David Boder: And how did one drink the water?

00:07:09.723 --> 00:07:14.057
Gert Silberbart: It was drunken with cups or any other containers that people had along...

00:07:14.057 --> 00:07:22.659
David Boder: Yes. Now, and, eh, tell me how, what happened in the first two hours after the train had arrived in Auschwitz.

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:46.822
Gert Silberbart: We were all, we were all unloaded from the car, and immediately a loud voice called: women, men, women to the left, men to the right. I stood with the men, in the dark, I had, we had arrived late in the evening, and it was already very dark, beginning of March, it was dark, and I lost track of father and mother, and saw no member of my family anymore.

00:07:46.822 --> 00:07:50.949
David Boder: So, you are saying that immediately, immediately you did not see your father anymore, either...

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:53.280
Gert Silberbart: No, I did not see any member of my family anymore.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.666
David Boder: And you were how old?

00:07:54.666 --> 00:07:56.546
Gert Silberbart: I was then 14 years old.

00:07:56.546 --> 00:07:58.727
David Boder: 14 years, that was in which year?

00:07:58.727 --> 00:08:01.119
Gert Silberbart: That was in the beginning of ’43.

00:08:01.119 --> 00:08:08.541
David Boder: Now, wait—you say the difficulties began in ’38.

00:08:08.541 --> 00:08:09.155
Gert Silberbart: Yes.

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:12.589
David Boder: Where were you from ’38 to ’43?

00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:20.782
Gert Silberbart: From ’38 to ’43 I was still in Berlin, I visited school until the year ’41, until they were forced to close.

00:08:20.782 --> 00:08:24.800
David Boder: Yes. And what did your father do during this time?

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:30.101
Gert Silberbart: My father was not able to work at all during this time, and was later forced into a factory.

00:08:30.101 --> 00:08:30.372
David Boder: Yes...

00:08:30.372 --> 00:08:33.083
Gert Silberbart: . . . where he had to work until his evacuation.

00:08:33.083 --> 00:08:36.336
David Boder: So when he worked in the factory, did he come home every day?

00:08:36.336 --> 00:08:37.692
Gert Silberbart: Yes.

00:08:37.692 --> 00:08:39.059
David Boder: . . . he came home every day?

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:39.361
Gert Silberbart: Yes.

00:08:39.361 --> 00:08:44.584
David Boder: . . . so between ’38 and ’42 you were still living in Berlin, right?

00:08:44.584 --> 00:08:44.807
Gert Silberbart: Yes.

00:08:44.807 --> 00:08:47.440
David Boder: . . . and you went to school until ’42?

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.958
Gert Silberbart: No, until ’41.

00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.223
David Boder: Until ’41.

00:08:50.223 --> 00:08:50.524
Gert Silberbart: Yes.

00:08:50.524 --> 00:08:54.018
David Boder: And what did you do in the rest of the time where you could not attend school?

00:08:54.018 --> 00:09:02.301
Gert Silberbart: There I worked in kitchens and also in, eh, my friend who was a Mischling [literally “cross-breed” in German; a person with mixed Jewish ancestry], his father was a pharmacist, who took me into his lab—

00:09:02.301 --> 00:09:02.573
David Boder: Yes.

00:09:02.573 --> 00:09:04.422
Gert Silberbart: . . . where I could receive a little training.

00:09:04.422 --> 00:09:06.169
David Boder: Was that, eh, allowed?

00:09:06.169 --> 00:09:11.561
Gert Silberbart: That was not allowed, that was illegal. But because he was a good friend of mine, it did not become public.

00:09:11.561 --> 00:09:14.163
David Boder: Yes. And then you learned a little bit of pharmacy, right?

00:09:14.163 --> 00:09:15.127
Gert Silberbart: Yes.

00:09:15.127 --> 00:09:24.194
David Boder: And, eh, then, eh, were, eh—the people came and you were sent to the concentration camp in Auschwitz in ’42—in ’43 ’43...

00:09:24.194 --> 00:09:25.441
Gert Silberbart: Yes, yes.

00:09:25.441 --> 00:09:29.037
David Boder: What, eh, did they give you any reasons as to what?

00:09:29.037 --> 00:09:35.724
Gert Silberbart: None, after all, we were pretty much the last ones, we were lucky to be among the last, and we knew already that thousands had gone there before us.

00:09:35.724 --> 00:09:39.308
David Boder: Aha. And then you...how old was your little sister?

00:09:39.308 --> 00:09:41.116
Gert Silberbart: My little sister was eight years back then.

00:09:41.116 --> 00:09:44.200
David Boder: Aha. And you were, eh, 14 years old.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:44.562
Gert Silberbart: Yes.

00:09:44.562 --> 00:09:45.869
David Boder: And you assembled with the men?

00:09:45.869 --> 00:09:46.110
Gert Silberbart: Yes.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:48.942
David Boder: Didn’t your father place himself with the men?

00:09:48.942 --> 00:10:04.315
Gert Silberbart: Probably, I did not see him anymore, we were called up, each one had to loudly state his profession and age, and, eh, at the cue of the SS Commander one had to line up to the right or to the left, the right meant the gas chambers, the left meant the living.

00:10:04.315 --> 00:10:07.147
David Boder: And what profession did you state?

00:10:07.147 --> 00:10:15.683
Gert Silberbart: I gave no profession, just student. But because I looked pretty athletic then, I looked fit for work, and I lined up with the living.

00:10:15.683 --> 00:10:19.358
David Boder: Yes. And then, what happened afterwards in, how...[?]

00:10:19.358 --> 00:10:21.569
Gert Silberbart: Then we were led to a disinfection...

00:10:21.569 --> 00:10:23.449
David Boder: Was that in Birkenau or in Auschwitz?

00:10:23.449 --> 00:10:25.238
Gert Silberbart: Directly in Auschwitz, where we arrived.

00:10:25.238 --> 00:10:26.865
David Boder: Yes—and where were the crematoriums?

00:10:26.865 --> 00:10:30.763
Gert Silberbart: The crematoriums were in Birkenau, which I had not yet seen at that time.

00:10:30.763 --> 00:10:33.877
David Boder: Aha. Could you see Birkenau from Auschwitz?

00:10:33.877 --> 00:10:42.100
Gert Silberbart: We saw a big fire, but we did not know what that meant. Only later it became clear to us that those were the gas furnaces, the crematoriums of Birkenau. [noise]

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:46.980
David Boder: Aha. But you could see the fires in Birkenau from Auschwitz?

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.046
Gert Silberbart: Yes, very well.

00:10:48.046 --> 00:10:52.113
David Boder: Yes. Well? And then, what happened during the night?

00:10:52.113 --> 00:10:56.372
Gert Silberbart: Then we were led into a sub-camp of Auschwitz, the labor camp of Buna...

00:10:56.372 --> 00:10:56.764
David Boder: Yes.

00:10:56.764 --> 00:11:06.354
Gert Silberbart: There we were all stripped, disinfected, and all that we had on us was taken from us. We were bathed, our hair was cut, and we were dressed in prisoner suits.

00:11:06.354 --> 00:11:09.547
David Boder: Who cut your hair and how was that done?

00:11:09.547 --> 00:11:16.535
Gert Silberbart: Already long—prisoners who had been in the concentration camp for a long time, whose job it was to function as [?].

00:11:16.535 --> 00:11:18.915
David Boder: And what did they use, scissors, or, or...

00:11:18.915 --> 00:11:21.427
Gert Silberbart: Regular, simple regular hair cutting devices, manually operated.

00:11:21.427 --> 00:11:22.210
David Boder: Was—by hand?

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:24.108
Gert Silberbart: . . . hand operated, hair cutting devices.

00:11:24.108 --> 00:11:25.204
David Boder: So hand hair cutting machines.

00:11:25.204 --> 00:11:25.506
Gert Silberbart: Yes.

00:11:25.506 --> 00:11:29.765
David Boder: Yes. And your hair was cut off your head?

00:11:29.765 --> 00:11:31.361
Gert Silberbart: Yes, everywhere where we had hair.

00:11:31.361 --> 00:11:33.831
David Boder: Yes. And then, what was done then?

00:11:33.831 --> 00:11:41.572
Gert Silberbart: Then we came into the barracks, our names and data were taken, our age, then we were put into the single booths....

00:11:41.572 --> 00:11:44.193
David Boder: How, what did you give as your age?

00:11:44.193 --> 00:11:45.982
Gert Silberbart: My real age, 14 years.

00:11:45.982 --> 00:11:47.639
David Boder: Yes. And?

00:11:47.639 --> 00:12:02.591
Gert Silberbart: We slept until five, in the morning at five o’clock we received a little coffee, a piece of bread, and we had to line up in front of the block where we were drilled in this standing at attention and all the steps, the marching steps. And then...

00:12:02.591 --> 00:12:03.627
David Boder: In what way?

00:12:03.627 --> 00:12:16.549
Gert Silberbart: That differed. We had to line up in five rows which still went very well, then we exercised right turns and left turns, then marching, which did not go so well in the beginning, but that was was taught to us via rifle butt hits.

00:12:16.549 --> 00:12:20.373
David Boder: Yes, and...Eh, you want to eat?

00:12:20.373 --> 00:12:21.046
Gert Silberbart: Yes.

00:12:21.046 --> 00:12:23.140
David Boder: A little to eat?

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:32.068
David Boder: So, before the meal, we left off where you told us how you were taught to march. Now go on.

00:12:32.068 --> 00:12:44.640
Gert Silberbart: Yes, and then came a member of the Arbeitsdienst [Labor Service] whose task it was to learn about our professions and in which way we could be best put to work.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.755
David Boder: Was that an inmate?

00:12:45.755 --> 00:12:49.080
Gert Silberbart: That was also an inmate who had been in the concentration camp for a long time...

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:49.201
David Boder: Yes, was that a Jew?

00:12:49.201 --> 00:12:54.364
Gert Silberbart: . . . and who was entrusted by the SS leadership—no, that was not a Jew. That was a German political prisoner.

00:12:54.364 --> 00:12:55.521
David Boder: Yes. Yes.

00:12:55.521 --> 00:13:14.961
Gert Silberbart: And, since I did not have a profession, I was put into a commando, into a work detail where I had to haul cement all day, and unload iron from train cars, and that was pretty hard for me at 14 years, to carry sacks of 50 kilos, without a break, a boy of 14 years, I mean, I was not used to that, I had a little hard time with that.

00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:15.907
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:15.907 --> 00:13:19.443
Gert Silberbart: But then I got used to it, had to get used to it.

00:13:19.443 --> 00:13:20.588
David Boder: Well, and?

00:13:20.588 --> 00:13:43.461
Gert Silberbart: Well, and so I just worked from six o’clock in the morning until six, seven o’clock in the afternoon, six or seven days a week, sometimes it occurred that we had off on Sunday, but that did not depend on us, or on our output, but on the, on the SS guards who just simply did not want to go out there with us on Sundays, and guard us, and who wanted to stay in the camp themselves, or outside the camp in their barracks.

00:13:43.461 --> 00:13:45.988
David Boder: So, what did you do then on Sundays?

00:13:45.988 --> 00:14:05.536
Gert Silberbart: On Sundays we did not have peace, either, then it was lice checks, what was, which was pretty unpleasant for us, but that was for the benfit of our health, because there were many among us who attracted lice after a short while, and they surely would have infected all of us, and we, many of us, would have fallen prey to the bugs if there had not been those lice checks.

00:14:05.536 --> 00:14:07.374
David Boder: So describe the lice checks.

00:14:07.374 --> 00:14:16.513
Gert Silberbart: Yes, we just all had to strip naked, and one after the other had to go in front of the doctor who examined us thoroughly whether we had lice, one after the other.

00:14:16.513 --> 00:14:19.146
David Boder: Yes, but were there not lice in the clothes?

00:14:19.146 --> 00:14:20.815
Gert Silberbart: The clothes were examined, too.

00:14:20.815 --> 00:14:23.357
David Boder: Now, and if you had lice, then what?

00:14:23.357 --> 00:14:31.911
Gert Silberbart: We were immediately led into the disinfection, we were totally disinfected, examined if we showed any signs of typhoid fever, and if not, we were put back into the block.

00:14:31.911 --> 00:14:36.942
David Boder: And if one showed all, if one showed any signs or symptoms of typhoid fever, then...?

00:14:36.942 --> 00:14:53.611
Gert Silberbart: Then they stayed in the sick building, were examined, and if the case was so bad already that they could not be healed in the camp they came into the main camp in Auschwitz where the sick block was better equipped, and where they had more possibilities to closer examine the patient.

00:14:53.611 --> 00:14:55.671
David Boder: And? If he had typhoid fever?

00:14:55.671 --> 00:15:05.641
Gert Silberbart: Then he was put into a special barrack, received to eat like all the others, and if he healed it was good, and he was sent back to work, if not, well, then he just died.

00:15:05.641 --> 00:15:10.370
David Boder: Yes. Well? So, eh, that was on Sundays...

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:10.852
Gert Silberbart: Yes.

00:15:10.852 --> 00:15:14.521
David Boder: . . . and how long did that take? That was in ’43?

00:15:14.521 --> 00:15:16.039
Gert Silberbart: That was in the year ’43.

00:15:16.039 --> 00:15:16.852
David Boder: Summer, winter?

00:15:16.852 --> 00:15:19.352
Gert Silberbart: Beginning of ’43, March, April, May.

00:15:19.352 --> 00:15:19.563
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:19.563 --> 00:15:27.244
Gert Silberbart: Then I became sick, had a 40°C [104° Fahrenheit] fever, went directly into the Krankenbau [sick bay] into the K, the KB as it was called, but they could not...

00:15:27.244 --> 00:15:28.130
David Boder: KB, Krankenbau?

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:29.226
Gert Silberbart: KB, Krankenbau.

00:15:29.226 --> 00:15:30.010
David Boder: Yes?

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:37.281
Gert Silberbart: But they could not determine what I had, my fever was persistent, and they sent me in an ambulance to the Auschwitz main camp.

00:15:37.281 --> 00:15:37.582
David Boder: Yes?

00:15:37.582 --> 00:16:00.178
Gert Silberbart: There I was led into the large Krankenbau, my temperature was taken, and I had something above 40°C again. I was, one looked into my throat but nothing could be diagnosed. Then they put me under an ice-cold shower which was pretty hard for me, to stay under there, but I had to, and that shower just worked wonders. The next day I had normal temperatures already, and I was immediately sent to another camp.

00:16:00.178 --> 00:16:02.298
David Boder: How long were you under the shower?

00:16:02.298 --> 00:16:04.136
Gert Silberbart: I was under the shower for about fifteen minutes.

00:16:04.136 --> 00:16:06.226
David Boder: Who ordered that?

00:16:06.226 --> 00:16:19.630
Gert Silberbart: That is, that was no order, every, every patient that came from another camp was immediately disinfected and put under a cold shower, and apparently they had made the experience that this cold shower massively reduced the fever, and so they used it, like a regular procedure...

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:19.973
David Boder: Yes.

00:16:19.973 --> 00:16:20.787
Gert Silberbart: . . . to put every patient under a shower.

00:16:20.787 --> 00:16:22.847
David Boder: And the fever was down the next day?

00:16:22.847 --> 00:16:30.769
Gert Silberbart: Yes, of course I was very weakened, but that did not concern them, the main thing was that the thermometer showed 36°C [96.8°F], and I was sent to work right away.

00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:34.938
David Boder: Yes. Now, and then what did you work again?

00:16:34.938 --> 00:16:35.281
Gert Silberbart: There I worked...

00:16:35.281 --> 00:16:36.516
David Boder: . . . and how did the work go?

00:16:36.516 --> 00:16:53.504
Gert Silberbart: There I worked in similar commandos, as amasonry or metal worker, just how I was assigned. There was a part of a, lack of personnel on this commando, on another day people were needed on that detail, so that from one day to the next we were assigned very different tasks.

00:16:53.504 --> 00:16:55.492
David Boder: Yes, and?

00:16:55.492 --> 00:17:00.135
Gert Silberbart: I stayed there until the end of ’44. Until the...

00:17:00.135 --> 00:17:04.575
David Boder: An how did it go with the work , was the treatment more or less good?

00:17:04.575 --> 00:17:07.479
Gert Silberbart: The treatment...of course, we were naturally beaten very heavily, but that is...

00:17:07.479 --> 00:17:09.389
David Boder: Why is that so natural?

00:17:09.389 --> 00:17:23.226
Gert Silberbart: That is is self-understood, I think...I think that this is well known enough from books and reports and films that I don’t even hve to mention it. Because the beatings were simply—part of the concentration camp, just as a typewriter belongs in an office.

00:17:23.226 --> 00:17:25.395
David Boder: Who beat you the most?

00:17:25.395 --> 00:17:27.744
Gert Silberbart: The capos as well as the SS men.

00:17:27.744 --> 00:17:30.184
David Boder: How, who were the capos? Please describe them.

00:17:30.184 --> 00:17:49.456
Gert Silberbart: Capos were inmates who had been in the KZ for years, who were well known by the SS, and who received from the SS,or from Arbeitsdienst, the Labor Service of the SS, a yellow armband with the inscription KAPO on it, and those had then the resp—, were responsible for the daily job perfomance.

00:17:49.456 --> 00:17:55.119
David Boder: What is the, eh, the origin of the word “capo”? Why did the Germans use that?

00:17:55.119 --> 00:17:58.402
Gert Silberbart: Nobody knows that. That is not known even today.

00:17:58.402 --> 00:18:02.617
David Boder: Capos in Latin means head or leader or...

00:18:02.617 --> 00:18:04.768
Gert Silberbart: Could be that it comes from there.

00:18:04.768 --> 00:18:06.407
David Boder: Tell me, have you heard the word Musulmann?

00:18:06.407 --> 00:18:37.184
Gert Silberbart: Certainly, as Muselmänner were those described who were emaciated, very emaciated through the hard labor, and who were weakened, and with those Muselmänner, those were those who had to march through the gate into the camp after the work was finished, who had to strip and then went in front of the camp doctor. This Lagerarzt [camp physician] then decided, again through a cue with this hand to the left or the right, [the people] to the left went to the gas chambers, those one the right remained at work,.

00:18:37.184 --> 00:18:39.666
David Boder: Yes, what does that mean, they went to the gas chambers?

00:18:39.666 --> 00:18:41.997
Gert Silberbart: They were immediately rounded up by the SS...

00:18:41.997 --> 00:18:42.521
David Boder: Was there not a great outcry?

00:18:42.521 --> 00:18:59.660
Gert Silberbart: . . . certainly there was a lot of outcry because the people all knew where they went. It was, it was not the first time that such situations occurred. They came into a block, all together under heavy SS guard, and then usually they were loaded in cars the next day and went to the gas chambers.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.811
David Boder: You say there was a lot of crying.

00:19:01.811 --> 00:19:11.582
Gert Silberbart: Of course, the people were screaming and praying. I mean, a man who knows the he will be gassed in two hours, three hours, is not human anymore, is frantically desperate, you know?

00:19:11.582 --> 00:19:14.142
David Boder: Now, did the pleading help sometimes?

00:19:14.142 --> 00:19:23.540
Gert Silberbart: Of course it did not help. That was something the people knew, too, but in that moment, when it is there, you cannot think logically anymore, you are not yourself anymore.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.269
David Boder: Have you yourself seen and heard this?

00:19:25.269 --> 00:19:27.871
Gert Silberbart: I have seen and heard it myself.

00:19:27.871 --> 00:19:30.763
David Boder: How come that you came through?

00:19:30.763 --> 00:19:34.570
Gert Silberbart: I was just...I was just still strong enough to work.

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:39.239
David Boder: Aha. Now, so, how long did that last in Auschwitz?

00:19:39.239 --> 00:19:42.685
Gert Silberbart: I lived there until the end of ’44, until about September.

00:19:42.685 --> 00:19:43.360
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:49.065
Gert Silberbart: Then one day came a commission of a German enterprise, Siemens...you have heard of it...

00:19:49.065 --> 00:19:50.656
David Boder: Siemens and Halske, or?

00:19:50.656 --> 00:19:51.933
Gert Silberbart: Siemens Schuckert.

00:19:51.933 --> 00:19:53.258
David Boder: Siemens and Schuckert, yes.

00:19:53.258 --> 00:19:57.927
Gert Silberbart: And one day before this commission came, there was the order that all youths should stay in camp.

00:19:57.927 --> 00:19:58.379
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:58.379 --> 00:20:11.433
Gert Silberbart: So we stayed in the camp. This commission came. We were introduced to the commission, they asked us some questions, questioned us in regards to our schooling, and they said that they needed trainee mechanics.

00:20:11.433 --> 00:20:14.325
David Boder: So, those were not the capos anymore or the SS.

00:20:14.325 --> 00:20:15.452
Gert Silberbart: No, those were civilians.

00:20:15.452 --> 00:20:17.603
David Boder: Civilians. Were they polite?

00:20:17.603 --> 00:20:21.681
Gert Silberbart: They were very polite to us. They used a totally unaccustomed tone.

00:20:21.681 --> 00:20:21.892
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:21.892 --> 00:20:25.507
Gert Silberbart: Something we were never used before, neither from the SS people nor from the capos.

00:20:25.507 --> 00:20:27.838
David Boder: Yes. And they talked friendly to you?

00:20:27.838 --> 00:20:29.676
Gert Silberbart: They were pretty friendly with us.

00:20:29.676 --> 00:20:30.170
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:34.441
Gert Silberbart: They asked us different things regarding our origin and our schooling...

00:20:34.441 --> 00:20:35.074
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:35.074 --> 00:20:44.544
Gert Silberbart: . . . asked us several questions and then selected twenty-five of us who were supposed to join their company as trainee mechanics.

00:20:44.544 --> 00:20:45.640
David Boder: And you were among them.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.695
Gert Silberbart: And I was among them.

00:20:46.695 --> 00:20:47.340
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:21:01.930
Gert Silberbart: From that day on we did not have to go to work anymore, came into a quarantine block, where we stayed about eight days, and were then picked up by a car, also by SS men, and came into a small camp that had just been established in the vicinity of Auschwitz.

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:02.774
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:02.774 --> 00:21:08.268
Gert Silberbart: There we went through disinfection again, were dressed again, the hair was cut that had...

00:21:08.268 --> 00:21:09.485
David Boder: . . . as before...

00:21:09.485 --> 00:21:26.515
Gert Silberbart: . . . as before, and then we began work outside, first with masonry work, because the factory was not entirely finished yet, so we had to do exterior work, until the factory was finally completed. Machines were installed, and we slowly began our mechanic work.

00:21:26.515 --> 00:21:27.569
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:27.569 --> 00:21:52.496
Gert Silberbart: At first, we were assigned some jobs, but later they needed us again more for the exterior work, the masonry, hauling sand and so on, so that we did not really feel a difference between Auschwitz and this smaller camp. At least we had a little more peace, we were all in all only 150 inmates, only, except for the commando, there were some SS guards, so that we perceived it as very agreeable to be with so few people.

00:21:52.496 --> 00:21:54.153
David Boder: Has the, was the treatment better?

00:21:54.153 --> 00:22:06.033
Gert Silberbart: The treatment was a little better, simply because one single commando leader could not be at all places, so we took advantage of that, those times where he was at the other end of the camp to relax a little bit.

00:22:06.033 --> 00:22:08.033
David Boder: And were there no capos?

00:22:08.033 --> 00:22:22.190
Gert Silberbart: There was a capo, but he was pretty nice, because he himself did not have to be so afraid of the commando leader, after all, the capo,in Auschwitz also just did [it] out of fear, because after all they were punished if the job performance was not sufficient.

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:22.594
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:22.594 --> 00:22:30.829
Gert Silberbart: Of course they also tried to kiss up to the SS people, they received cigarettes, so that they did not care about one beating more or less.

00:22:30.829 --> 00:22:35.721
David Boder: Yes. Now, and so you worked at Siemens and Schuckert?

00:22:35.721 --> 00:22:35.944
Gert Silberbart: Yes.

00:22:35.944 --> 00:22:36.830
David Boder: How long did that last?

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:52.354
Gert Silberbart: There I worked until the end of the year 1944, beginning of ’45, until January. Then when the Russians slowly advanced in the East, the situation became critical, and we marched from, from this camp, Bobrek was the name, to Buna, where I had been before, all in the beginning...

00:22:52.354 --> 00:22:53.047
David Boder: Buna?

00:22:53.047 --> 00:22:53.601
Gert Silberbart: Yes.

00:22:53.601 --> 00:22:55.077
David Boder: So Bobrek was the Außenlager [subcamp]?

00:22:55.077 --> 00:22:56.583
Gert Silberbart: That, that camp was Bobrek.

00:22:56.583 --> 00:22:56.945
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:56.945 --> 00:23:08.478
Gert Silberbart: Then I came back to camp Buna where I had been interned in the beginning of ’43. There we stayed for about three hours, the entire Buna camp was evacuated, and we marched from Buna directly to Buchenwald.

00:23:08.478 --> 00:23:11.810
David Boder: How far was that and how long did the march last?

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:16.287
Gert Silberbart: I can’t, I really cannot give you the distance, I really don’t know.

00:23:16.287 --> 00:23:18.006
David Boder: So Buna is close to Auschwitz?

00:23:18.006 --> 00:23:20.373
Gert Silberbart: Buna is by Auschwitz, one kilometer away from Auschwitz.

00:23:20.373 --> 00:23:20.629
David Boder: So...

00:23:20.629 --> 00:23:22.077
Gert Silberbart: Buchenwald is in Thuringia.

00:23:22.077 --> 00:23:25.831
David Boder: And, eh, so Buna is, Auschwitz is next to Breslau approximately...

00:23:25.831 --> 00:23:30.158
Gert Silberbart: No, no, Auschwitz is much, much further than Breslau, Breslau is already the German Upper Silesia....

00:23:30.158 --> 00:23:30.505
David Boder: Yes...

00:23:30.505 --> 00:23:31.726
Gert Silberbart: . . . while Auschwitz is in Poland.

00:23:31.726 --> 00:23:35.736
David Boder: Yes, so Auschwitz, and then it went to Thuringia, right?

00:23:35.736 --> 00:23:36.611
Gert Silberbart: Then it was on to Thuringia.

00:23:36.611 --> 00:23:37.289
David Boder: Yes, now?

00:23:37.289 --> 00:23:46.335
Gert Silberbart: At first we walked from Buna approximately fifty kilometers, until we reached a barn in Nikolai where we rested for the first time for some hours.

00:23:46.335 --> 00:23:47.888
David Boder: What do you mean, you walked?

00:23:47.888 --> 00:23:49.079
Gert Silberbart: We, we marched.

00:23:49.079 --> 00:23:49.426
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:49.426 --> 00:23:51.069
Gert Silberbart: Without pause, fifty kilometer.

00:23:51.069 --> 00:23:51.491
David Boder: . . . kilometer...

00:23:51.491 --> 00:23:59.783
Gert Silberbart: . . . which of course was very hard for us in our wooden shoes, in our thin clothes, and through the snow, and the SS men drove us.

00:23:59.783 --> 00:24:02.843
David Boder: Was it not fast to walk for the SS men also?

00:24:02.843 --> 00:24:08.813
Gert Silberbart: Relatively many SS men got weak and could not keep up.

00:24:08.813 --> 00:24:09.899
David Boder: What happened to them?

00:24:09.899 --> 00:24:15.160
Gert Silberbart: They were loaded into an ambulance and were brought to the military hospital.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:18.567
David Boder: Yes. And, eh, what happened to the prisoners who could not keep up anymore?

00:24:18.567 --> 00:24:29.542
Gert Silberbart: The prisoners who could not keep up anymore, just broke ranks and received the Gnadenschuss [coup de grace], and just stayed there, and were then later picked up by a car that collected all corpses and brought them to the crematorium.

00:24:29.542 --> 00:24:31.020
David Boder: A Gnadenschuss? Now?

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:33.296
Gert Silberbart: Yes, one can call that a Gnadenschuss.

00:24:33.296 --> 00:24:34.713
David Boder: And?

00:24:34.713 --> 00:24:47.558
Gert Silberbart: Yes, and then, after we had the first part behind us, that lasted about eight hours in Nikolai, we continued to march on to Gleiwitz. In Gleiwitz was also such a concentration camp which however had been cleared in the meantime. We stayed there for one night.

00:24:47.558 --> 00:24:50.136
David Boder: Slower, a little slower, please, yes? Yes?

00:24:50.136 --> 00:24:55.096
Gert Silberbart: Of course, the camp was too small to absorb all the prisoners from Buna and Bobrek...

00:24:55.096 --> 00:24:57.523
David Boder: How many men were there approximately, you think?

00:24:57.523 --> 00:25:02.227
Gert Silberbart: There were approximately 40,000 to 45,000 men, I don’t know, however, if my estimate is correct, I really don’t know.

00:25:02.227 --> 00:25:04.021
David Boder: Oh well—so?

00:25:04.021 --> 00:25:07.654
Gert Silberbart: Hundreds had already been left on the way...

00:25:07.654 --> 00:25:08.257
David Boder: And?

00:25:08.257 --> 00:25:11.001
Gert Silberbart: Anyway, a part of the ca—, a part...

00:25:11.001 --> 00:25:15.509
David Boder: Now, when the bodies were left there, did one leave them their clothes, or have other...

00:25:15.509 --> 00:25:31.504
Gert Silberbart: They were left like that beause there was simply no time to take anything from them, because so, these people who were left there they were breaking rank, and anyone who strayed from the ranks was shot for attempted flight. So nobody had the opportunity to get out of the line and take clothes from the dead.

00:25:31.504 --> 00:25:32.393
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:32.393 --> 00:25:42.102
Gert Silberbart: We stayed in this camp Gleiwitz over night and the following day. Many preferred to sleep outside at night because there was not enough space in the camp for us all.

00:25:42.102 --> 00:25:43.926
David Boder: How was it with food?

00:25:43.926 --> 00:25:51.946
Gert Silberbart: As provisions we received shortly before our departure to Buchenwald, a small piece of bread and a, approximately fifty grams of sausage.

00:25:51.946 --> 00:25:53.243
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:53.243 --> 00:26:01.218
Gert Silberbart: So in the evening of the following day we were loaded on train cars, we, some of the cars were loaded with 150 to 200 men.

00:26:01.218 --> 00:26:02.982
David Boder: Was there anything to eat?

00:26:02.982 --> 00:26:14.273
Gert Silberbart: One was—one could eat, we did not ask in such a situation anymore what was to to eat and what was not eatable, we ate a lot, where nowadays , where we nowadays would be disgusted.

00:26:14.273 --> 00:26:16.022
David Boder: For instance?

00:26:16.022 --> 00:26:24.072
Gert Silberbart: Yes, simply what we could grab from trash cans in the street. Potatos, rotten carrots, and so on, beet roots.

00:26:24.072 --> 00:26:32.873
David Boder: Yes, during the, during the walk. Now tell me, when you marched, where did, did you not pass cities or villages?

00:26:32.873 --> 00:26:45.913
Gert Silberbart: We mostly marched through the countryside. Only some farmers saw us. Of course, we also passed smaller cities and villages. The people just looked on, but seeing the SS they got afraid and they retreated into their homes.

00:26:45.913 --> 00:26:49.712
David Boder: Yes, and you had no opportunity to talk to the people?

00:26:49.712 --> 00:26:50.918
Gert Silberbart: No, never.

00:26:50.918 --> 00:26:52.667
David Boder: So, go on.

00:26:52.667 --> 00:27:05.104
Gert Silberbart: And so we were loaded onto the cars, the train started moving, and it was horrible at first. We hat no opportunity to sit down in there, horrible, we were 150 men, one pressed to the other.

00:27:05.104 --> 00:27:06.582
David Boder: Closed cars?

00:27:06.582 --> 00:27:07.773
Gert Silberbart: Open cars. Open on the top.

00:27:07.773 --> 00:27:09.477
David Boder: Oh, those were the open cars?

00:27:09.477 --> 00:27:09.914
Gert Silberbart: Yes.

00:27:09.914 --> 00:27:10.728
David Boder: . . . and it was in the winter?

00:27:10.728 --> 00:27:11.633
Gert Silberbart: That was in the winter.

00:27:11.633 --> 00:27:12.251
David Boder: Yes, no carry on.

00:27:12.251 --> 00:27:18.070
Gert Silberbart: We only had our thin clothing, and one can almost say, people died by the hour.

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:19.487
David Boder: From what?

00:27:19.487 --> 00:27:53.794
Gert Silberbart: From the cold—, from cold, from hunger, from exhaustion, it all came together after all. The dead were then thrown from the car. Some received a shot, some did not, and thus we had more and more space in the car. It is realy terrible to have to say it that way, but we did not even perceive it as so bad if someone died, we were so down and out that the instinct of self-preservation prevailed for each of us—and we hardly bothered about the fate of the others.

00:27:53.794 --> 00:27:55.935
David Boder: Were there only men or also women?

00:27:55.935 --> 00:27:56.915
Gert Silberbart: It was only men.

00:27:56.915 --> 00:27:58.799
David Boder: Yes, and then?

00:27:58.799 --> 00:28:10.287
Gert Silberbart: And there remained, from our car of 150 men, only 80 who arrived in Buchenwald. In Buchenwald we were unloaded, totally exhausted, some could not even walk anymore, and the we walked to the camp.

00:28:10.287 --> 00:28:10.694
David Boder: Yes...

00:28:10.694 --> 00:28:14.131
David Boder: Which was approximately one kilometer away from the ramp.

00:28:14.131 --> 00:28:15.217
David Boder: From the train.

00:28:15.217 --> 00:28:15.775
Gert Silberbart: Yes.

00:28:15.775 --> 00:28:17.328
David Boder: Yes, and then?

00:28:17.328 --> 00:28:38.449
Gert Silberbart: There we were...we came first, we arrived late at twelve o’clock at night, then we came in a block, 2,000 men in one block, But we were deadly tired and exhausted. So we just slept wherever one put us or where we stood. The next morning we were disinfected, we almost all had lice.... . .

00:28:38.449 --> 00:28:38.916
David Boder: Yes...

00:28:38.916 --> 00:28:58.062
Gert Silberbart: . . . And we received new clothes, our hair was shorn, and we came to the so-called small camp [Kleine Lager] which was, which consisted of about ten blocks that were formerly horse barracks, where approximately 2,000 men had room, according to the planning [?] of the Germans...

00:28:58.062 --> 00:28:59.841
David Boder: Yes...

00:28:59.841 --> 00:29:18.097
Gert Silberbart: . . . and there we stayed approximately, there I stayed approximately one month, two, one an a half months. There we had relatively little [to do] we also did not receive anything to eat, and that, these hours...the time passed so slowly...that was truly terrible.

00:29:18.097 --> 00:29:19.273
David Boder: Didn’t you work?

00:29:19.273 --> 00:29:29.323
Gert Silberbart: We did, yes, sometimes we were assigned as helpers in the quarry, but er wer, we were not capable of working. We could not lift a little stone of three, four kilos anymore.

00:29:29.323 --> 00:29:30.107
David Boder: Yes.

00:29:30.107 --> 00:29:36.469
Gert Silberbart: We were so exhausted throught the whole journey and the last weeks, we were not even capable of working.

00:29:36.469 --> 00:29:36.801
David Boder: And?

00:29:36.801 --> 00:30:07.284
Gert Silberbart: These times where we did not work, did not make us stronger, on the contrary, it made us weaker because the whole day long we were sent out into the cold, we only had a thin suit, like a pajama, a pair of wooden shoes, no socks, and so we stayed the whole long day in a small fenced area in front of the block. We were cold, some had frostbite, frost on the fingers, and sometimes that became infected, an abscess, and many died of it.

00:30:07.284 --> 00:30:10.782
David Boder: Now, was that a youth block?

00:30:10.782 --> 00:30:13.330
Gert Silberbart: No, that was not a youth block, that was everybody together.

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:15.154
David Boder: And?

00:30:15.154 --> 00:30:24.320
Gert Silberbart: Yes, and then after approximately one and a half months I came...I came into the large camp [Große Lager]...

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:49.331
Gert Silberbart: . . . There I was put into a commando that had to to clean-up work in the city of Weimar, approximately seven kilometers from Buchenwald. Regarding the work it was much worse in Buchenwald, much worse, we sometimes had to be at the roll call at three or four o’clock in the morning, and we sometimes worked until seven or eight, sometimes nine o’clock in the evening in the city.

00:30:49.331 --> 00:30:50.703
David Boder: Yes, in what city, in Weimar?

00:30:50.703 --> 00:30:51.984
Gert Silberbart: In the city of Weimar, yes.

00:30:51.984 --> 00:30:53.733
David Boder: Yes. What did you work there?

00:30:53.733 --> 00:31:02.778
Gert Silberbart: The destroyed houses that were destroyed through air attacks and air mines, we had to discard the debris and build them up again.

00:31:02.778 --> 00:31:05.552
David Boder: How did that look. Was Weimer heavily bombed?

00:31:05.552 --> 00:31:07.753
Gert Silberbart: Weimar was pretty heavily detroyed.

00:31:07.753 --> 00:31:12.638
David Boder: And, eh, under the debris, did you find bodies?

00:31:12.638 --> 00:31:20.462
Gert Silberbart: We seldom found bodies. We had...we searched for food under the rubble, but we often found very little.

00:31:20.462 --> 00:31:23.929
David Boder: You found little. Did you sometimes find valuables?

00:31:23.929 --> 00:31:25.527
Gert Silberbart: Never.

00:31:25.527 --> 00:31:28.874
David Boder: Now go on. Were you able to take along what you found?

00:31:28.874 --> 00:31:40.726
Gert Silberbart: No, everyone was searched at the entrance to the camp, after the deployment we were searched to the bones so that nothing could be brought inside the camp.

00:31:40.726 --> 00:31:42.038
David Boder: Well?

00:31:42.038 --> 00:31:47.691
Gert Silberbart: I worked there until March of ’43...

00:31:47.691 --> 00:31:48.927
David Boder: Yes...

00:31:48.927 --> 00:31:57.922
Gert Silberbart: . . . until March of ’45, I meant. And then the Americans advanced slowly. In the end when the Americans were already in Erfurt...

00:31:57.922 --> 00:31:58.646
David Boder: Yes...

00:31:58.646 --> 00:32:12.350
Gert Silberbart: . . . we did not go out anymore, the danger was too great. The camp commander, an SS Obersturmführer had said before we should not be afraid, we should not revolt. He would quietly hand us over to the Americans.

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:13.360
David Boder: That is what the camp commander said?

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:17.340
Gert Silberbart: That is what the camp commander said. We, of course we did not believe him.

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:19.255
David Boder: And you think he said the truth?

00:32:19.255 --> 00:32:27.471
Gert Silberbart: Of course, he did not say the truth, we saw that a couple days later when all Jews were called to a roll call.

00:32:27.471 --> 00:32:28.225
David Boder: Yes.

00:32:28.225 --> 00:32:50.190
Gert Silberbart: Of course, no Jew came, no Jew was to be seen at the assembly place, so that the SS were forced to move into the camp to force the Jews on to the assembly area with rifle butt beatings. From there they were transported out of the camp. Under SS guard they started their march.

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:51.743
David Boder: Were you among them?

00:32:51.743 --> 00:32:53.055
Gert Silberbart: No, I was not among them. If I had been among them I would not have been...

00:32:53.055 --> 00:32:53.492
David Boder: Why not?

00:32:53.492 --> 00:33:05.733
Gert Silberbart: Because I, I had hidden in several blocks, in basements, partly in the sewers, the canalization, in holes in the sewage system, in attics, in short, in every hideout where I could disappear.

00:33:05.733 --> 00:33:07.150
David Boder: In holes of the sewage system?

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:07.904
Gert Silberbart: Yes...in the sewer.

00:33:07.904 --> 00:33:09.743
David Boder: Weren’t you dirty there?

00:33:09.743 --> 00:33:16.196
Gert Silberbart: Of course it was dirty, but I knew, if I left the camp , had to go on the march, that would have been my death.

00:33:16.196 --> 00:33:17.930
David Boder: Why did you know that?

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:26.538
Gert Silberbart: Because I was simply not able to walk two to three kilometers anymore, I was so weakened through the past weeks and months that I could hardly stand upright on my legs.

00:33:26.538 --> 00:33:30.036
David Boder: Aha, and then?

00:33:30.036 --> 00:33:53.297
Gert Silberbart: Thus I was hiding for about a week. Constantly there was the call for the Jews to come out [“Juden raus,” literally “Jews out”] and when the largest part of the Jews were gone, they went after the Christians. There were daily transports from the camp, so that in the camp that had held 100,000 people a week before, at the point of liberation by the Americans on April 11, there were only 22,000 people left.

00:33:53.297 --> 00:33:57.319
David Boder: Yes, so, who were the others that were taken?

00:33:57.319 --> 00:34:01.284
Gert Silberbart: Just...the SS took everyone they could get. At the end there was...

00:34:01.284 --> 00:34:05.430
David Boder: Well, couldn’t they just arrest everyone? After all, the blocks were open.

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:18.892
Gert Silberbart: Yes, they could, they just could not get everyone because a large part had hidden in the camp. Then it was just to much for them, they did not have enough guards, enough SS men, who could guard us and send us on the way.

00:34:18.892 --> 00:34:20.490
David Boder: Yes, and the?

00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:21.154
Gert Silberbart: Yes, and then...

00:34:21.154 --> 00:34:24.064
David Boder: Did people try to flee along the way, run away?

00:34:24.064 --> 00:34:26.190
Gert Silberbart: No, nobody managed to do that.

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:28.919
David Boder: Well? And so?

00:34:28.919 --> 00:34:35.929
Gert Silberbart: And so the Americans came on the 11th, on the 11th of April at four o’clock in the afternoon, and liberated us.

00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:41.507
David Boder: Now, and how was that. Do you want to tell us about the last three days.

00:34:41.507 --> 00:34:44.115
Gert Silberbart: You want me tell about the last three days before the liberation?

00:34:44.115 --> 00:34:45.743
David Boder: Yes. Yes.

00:34:45.743 --> 00:35:06.852
Gert Silberbart: Well, so. I was during all these last three days in basements and sewage holes, I did not eat or drink during these days, just always anxiously listened to the cry of Juden raus or when something moved close to me, when I heard a sound, I winced.

00:35:06.852 --> 00:35:09.912
David Boder: So you say you did not really eat during the three days?

00:35:09.912 --> 00:35:16.123
Gert Silberbart: Yes. That was not, that was not the first time. I had already hungered for seven days, Nothing to eat and nothing to drink.

00:35:16.123 --> 00:35:20.797
David Boder: Well. Where, when did you hunger for seven days without food or drink?

00:35:20.797 --> 00:35:22.501
Gert Silberbart: During the first time in Buchenwald.

00:35:22.501 --> 00:35:24.446
David Boder: Why, you did not receive anything to eat?

00:35:24.446 --> 00:35:26.602
Gert Silberbart: No, we did not get anything to eat.

00:35:26.602 --> 00:35:28.426
David Boder: But water was there.

00:35:28.426 --> 00:35:29.436
Gert Silberbart: Water was there.

00:35:29.436 --> 00:35:30.883
David Boder: So you did drink.

00:35:30.883 --> 00:35:34.109
Gert Silberbart: Well. If you want to consider latrine water as a beverage...

00:35:34.109 --> 00:35:38.511
David Boder: Why was that waste water...wasn’t there clean water...

00:35:38.511 --> 00:35:42.612
Gert Silberbart: No, we could not reach, we could not get to the clean water.

00:35:42.612 --> 00:35:48.205
David Boder: And what is that, what do you mean, latrine waste water...did you have a water flush in the latrine?

00:35:48.205 --> 00:35:53.195
Gert Silberbart: It was just dirty water, rusty water, filthy water that came from some pipe, that was then...

00:35:53.195 --> 00:35:54.416
David Boder: And that you drank.

00:35:54.416 --> 00:35:56.376
Gert Silberbart: We drank that.

00:35:56.376 --> 00:35:58.200
David Boder: Well?

00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:59.255
Gert Silberbart: Yes, now...

00:35:59.255 --> 00:36:03.024
David Boder: From what...what sense did it make to not allow you to get water...

00:36:03.024 --> 00:36:09.205
Gert Silberbart: That I cannot tell you. There you should ask the people who forbade us...

00:36:09.205 --> 00:36:12.009
David Boder: I mean...Didn’t you say something?

00:36:12.009 --> 00:36:19.550
Gert Silberbart: We did not say anything. We took it as something self-understood. We were used to such things, such harrassments.

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:23.711
David Boder: Aha. Now, and then?

00:36:23.711 --> 00:36:28.746
Gert Silberbart: And so I lived in sewage holes for the last three days and...

00:36:28.746 --> 00:36:29.470
David Boder: Yes...

00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:32.003
Gert Silberbart: And attics and basements and so on...

00:36:32.003 --> 00:36:32.440
David Boder: And?

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:48.661
Gert Silberbart: Until I heard jubilation cries on April 11th in the afternoon, and heard American music from the loud speakers, and then came out and we embraced each other crying...

00:36:48.661 --> 00:36:51.194
David Boder: So American music from the radios...?

00:36:51.194 --> 00:36:58.144
Gert Silberbart: It was like this. In the room fo the camp commander outside the camp there was a big...microphone...

00:36:58.144 --> 00:36:58.551
David Boder: Yes...

00:36:58.551 --> 00:36:59.968
Gert Silberbart: . . . and in each block of the camp...

00:36:59.968 --> 00:37:00.662
David Boder: . . . a loudspeaker.

00:37:00.662 --> 00:37:01.823
Gert Silberbart: . . . a loudspeaker.

00:37:01.823 --> 00:37:02.562
David Boder: And?

00:37:02.562 --> 00:37:11.894
Gert Silberbart: . . . and this radio in the commander’s room played American music. The inmates stood up immediately...

00:37:11.894 --> 00:37:13.748
David Boder: Why were, eh...

00:37:13.748 --> 00:37:19.356
Gert Silberbart: He had a simple radio. He had probably listened to this American music the whole time...

00:37:19.356 --> 00:37:19.748
David Boder: Aha...

00:37:19.748 --> 00:37:22.160
Gert Silberbart: . . . but it was not transferred to the loudspeakers...

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.608
David Boder: No, was not broadcast...

00:37:23.608 --> 00:37:23.834
Gert Silberbart: Yes.

00:37:23.834 --> 00:37:26.771
David Boder: . . . so they just tuned in the American station?

00:37:26.771 --> 00:37:27.332
Gert Silberbart: Yes...

00:37:27.332 --> 00:37:29.247
David Boder: Tuned in and one heard American music?

00:37:29.247 --> 00:37:38.428
Gert Silberbart: . . . immediately heard American music. And the the first Americans, there were speeches over the loudspeakers. We were...we just knew we were free.

00:37:38.428 --> 00:37:38.564
David Boder: And?

00:37:38.564 --> 00:37:50.247
Gert Silberbart: We just could not grasp it in the first hours. Yes, And then we embraced crying, it is hard to describe the last, the first hours after the liberation...

00:37:50.247 --> 00:37:51.544
David Boder: Try it!

00:37:51.544 --> 00:38:20.369
Gert Silberbart: Yes, when I came up I saw some comrades again that I had known for a long time, and we embraced, and we could not fathom that we were free, but we were so exhausted from the last days that we had not eaten, in short, we were exhausted. The bad thing was also that the Germans in their retreat had destroyed the water pipeline so that there was no water in the whole camp and we almost died of thirst.

00:38:20.369 --> 00:38:34.495
David Boder: [In English] This concludes Spool, this concludes Spool 82 reported by Gert eh, by Gert Silbert...eh, Silbert, is that the name?

00:38:34.495 --> 00:38:35.535
Gert Silberbart: Silberbart...

00:38:35.535 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: Silberbart and we are going over to Spool 83. Geneva, August the 27th, 1946. Illinois Institute of Technology recording.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:38:57.515
David Boder: [In German] You heard American music...oh, one moment...

00:38:57.515 --> 00:39:04.425
David Boder: [In English] This is Spool 83, a continuation of 84, eh...82, Gert Silberbart concluding his report.

00:39:04.425 --> 00:39:08.721
David Boder: [In German] So you said, you heard American music amerikanische music...now go on?

00:39:08.721 --> 00:39:20.269
Gert Silberbart: Yes, so we came out of our hiding, and were happy about our new freedom, many actually collapsed on this occasion...

00:39:20.269 --> 00:39:22.772
David Boder: Did you see some Americans, too?

00:39:22.772 --> 00:39:34.636
Gert Silberbart: Yes, we immediately saw American tanks that crushed the barbed wire and the electrical fences. At once you saw white flags on the roofs, and there was jubilation and laughing all over the camp.

00:39:34.636 --> 00:39:36.687
David Boder: Who erected the white flags?

00:39:36.687 --> 00:39:38.752
Gert Silberbart: Those were simple bed sheets...

00:39:38.752 --> 00:39:40.350
David Boder: Yes, but who? The, eh, have you—

00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:42.401
Gert Silberbart: Prisoners, from us, no, no, yes...

00:39:42.401 --> 00:39:47.240
David Boder: Now, the prisoners did not have to surrender. What did the white flags mean?

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:52.004
Gert Silberbart: No, the white flags meant simply, that we were together with the Americans, that we...

00:39:52.004 --> 00:39:52.456
David Boder: Yes...

00:39:52.456 --> 00:39:53.602
Gert Silberbart: . . . not that they would use their weapons, or shoot, or what...

00:39:53.602 --> 00:39:54.898
David Boder: Yes, and what happened to the capos?

00:39:54.898 --> 00:40:08.630
Gert Silberbart: The capos were, a part of the capos who had a bad conscience, who had collaborated with the SS men during all these times, fled with the SS men who fled in the last minute.

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:11.103
David Boder: The Jews...were they Jewish capos?

00:40:11.103 --> 00:40:13.319
Gert Silberbart: I think, there were no Jewish capos in Buchenwald, I can say that.

00:40:13.319 --> 00:40:15.309
David Boder: Aha, yes. And?

00:40:15.309 --> 00:40:19.771
Gert Silberbart: Just these, eh, German capos, dangerous, hardened, professional criminals, and so...

00:40:19.771 --> 00:40:22.018
David Boder: Those fled with the SS men. Now...

00:40:22.018 --> 00:40:30.777
Gert Silberbart: The capos, who had a good conscience, who had been behaving fair towards their fellow prisoners, they stayed with us and also celebrated their freedom.

00:40:30.777 --> 00:40:36.340
David Boder: Yes. Now. Eh—did one catch some SS men? Did one...

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:46.486
Gert Silberbart: Very many were still caught on the way because...many inmates took eh, plundered right away these weapons arsenals, the arsenals of the SS...

00:40:46.486 --> 00:40:47.044
David Boder: Yes...

00:40:47.044 --> 00:40:55.049
Gert Silberbart: . . . and armed themselves and those strong enough ran after the SS, together with the Americans. Quite a few were still arrested.

00:40:55.049 --> 00:40:56.315
David Boder: And what was done to them?

00:40:56.315 --> 00:41:09.853
Gert Silberbart: They were first brought into the camp, and held in a block. They were disarmed and everything taken from them. Then, several days later, they were transported by the Americans, by the military, into Germany.

00:41:09.853 --> 00:41:13.468
David Boder: Did you have the opportunity to talk to the SS?

00:41:13.468 --> 00:41:19.378
Gert Silberbart: I did not have the opportunity myself because the whole time I was to weak to just go few steps out.

00:41:19.378 --> 00:41:19.845
David Boder: Well.

00:41:19.845 --> 00:41:21.926
Gert Silberbart: I had to strenthen myself first.

00:41:21.926 --> 00:41:23.660
David Boder: But others did?

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:32.781
Gert Silberbart: Yes, but I just rested. Others had the opportunity to talk to the SS men. Many also took revenge.

00:41:32.781 --> 00:41:34.062
David Boder: In what form?

00:41:34.062 --> 00:41:36.776
Gert Silberbart: Simply by harrassing them.

00:41:36.776 --> 00:41:43.846
David Boder: Yes. Did the Americanse defend or protect the SS in any form?

00:41:43.846 --> 00:42:18.724
Gert Silberbart: Neither defended nor protected them. They took—in the first days you saw rather few Americans in our camp because the camp was still in the front line, the whole area. Only later when the front had moved further into Germany, came a special camp commando of the U.S. Army, a great number of personnel, who took over the order of the camp. Also many tankers came that brought water into the camp. Because it took about a a week and a half until the water pipeline was restored.

00:42:18.724 --> 00:42:29.792
David Boder: Aha. Now tell me, there were so many inmates, how come that the SS was even left alive?

00:42:29.792 --> 00:42:48.485
Gert Silberbart: They were left alive. Because if we would not have left them live, the we would, we would not have been much different than the Germans. So we had to, we wanted to, after all, be a good example, if not by good example, but we should not have done to them what they did to us, then we would have been just the same.

00:42:48.485 --> 00:42:51.229
David Boder: That was the philosophy?

00:42:51.229 --> 00:42:58.924
Gert Silberbart: That was not the philosophy, that is my opinion. Surely many others had another opinion. But overall that was the mindset in the camp.

00:42:58.924 --> 00:43:03.974
David Boder: Is it true, that inmates hanged SS men in Buchenwald?

00:43:03.974 --> 00:43:05.813
Gert Silberbart: Inmates hanged SS men?

00:43:05.813 --> 00:43:06.477
David Boder: Yes?

00:43:06.477 --> 00:43:08.542
Gert Silberbart: That happened twice as far as I know.

00:43:08.542 --> 00:43:09.115
David Boder: Yes. When?

00:43:09.115 --> 00:43:11.407
Gert Silberbart: That was then—after the liberation.

00:43:11.407 --> 00:43:11.995
David Boder: Yes?

00:43:11.995 --> 00:43:23.889
Gert Silberbart: Those were indeed SS men who had just acted especially atrociously towards the inmates. But I only heard of it so I cannot tell more details about it.

00:43:23.889 --> 00:43:25.367
David Boder: You did not see that yourself?

00:43:25.367 --> 00:43:25.834
Gert Silberbart: No.

00:43:25.834 --> 00:43:29.694
David Boder: No. Now, and how did it go with food and meals?

00:43:29.694 --> 00:43:39.990
Gert Silberbart: Of course, the food improved immediately and immensely. Many were not used to the good fare of the American military, in fact, no one was...

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:40.503
David Boder: Yes .

00:43:40.503 --> 00:43:53.882
Gert Silberbart: . . . many suffered right away from diarrhea, stomach aches, gastritis. Nobody took well to it. The whole camp suffered from diarrhea. And only later, slowly, slowly, did we get used the the normal diet.

00:43:53.882 --> 00:43:57.093
David Boder: Now, and how long were you then in Buchenwald?

00:43:57.093 --> 00:44:12.500
Gert Silberbart: I was then in Buchenwald until the beginning of June 1945, when many youths had to had to sign up through the U.N. [?] and the transports went to Switzerland, and I was among them. And so I came to Switzerland.

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:14.520
David Boder: You chose Switzerland?

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:14.912
Gert Silberbart: Yes.

00:44:14.912 --> 00:44:18.123
David Boder: Have you tried to find your family or anybody?

00:44:18.123 --> 00:44:32.445
Gert Silberbart: I already did enough research. But I have no hope that anyone of them stayed alive. I only found my aunt and my uncle in Chile again who had emigrated there before—during the war.

00:44:32.445 --> 00:44:33.425
David Boder: What are their names?

00:44:33.425 --> 00:44:34.495
Gert Silberbart: Dahlinger.

00:44:34.495 --> 00:44:40.737
David Boder: Dahlinger. And how did you find them? Did you write them, and did they answer?

00:44:40.737 --> 00:44:51.606
Gert Silberbart: I did research through the Red Cross and several other organizations, and one, then one message came from them. And in September of last year I had the first message from them.

00:44:51.606 --> 00:44:56.400
David Boder: Aha. And, eh, what are you doing now?

00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:04.601
Gert Silberbart: Momentarily I am learning to be a dental technician in a laboratory of the OSE and besides I am taking evening classes at the commercial school, learning English, French, and...

00:45:04.601 --> 00:45:06.666
David Boder: What commercial school?

00:45:06.666 --> 00:45:09.078
Gert Silberbart: The Institute Commercial here in Bern.

00:45:09.078 --> 00:45:10.465
David Boder: Is that a private school?

00:45:10.465 --> 00:45:11.732
Gert Silberbart: No, that is a state school.

00:45:11.732 --> 00:45:13.737
David Boder: And you are allowed to attend the -?

00:45:13.737 --> 00:45:22.149
Gert Silberbart: I was allowed to attend the school, the OSE that also finances dental technician training, allowed me to attend this course and finances this also.

00:45:22.149 --> 00:45:27.757
David Boder: . . . and finances this course. And how do you get along with your co-students?

00:45:27.757 --> 00:45:33.953
Gert Silberbart: I, I had, I have not been long in this course, just a couple of days because the winter semester has just begun...

00:45:33.953 --> 00:45:34.571
David Boder: Yes...

00:45:34.571 --> 00:45:39.214
Gert Silberbart: . . . and I did not really have nearer contact with my fellow students yet, but it is going well.

00:45:39.214 --> 00:45:44.099
David Boder: Aha. Did they know that you, eh, were a former prisoner?

00:45:44.099 --> 00:45:46.707
Gert Silberbart: I think, I don’t know. They did not say anything, anyway.

00:45:46.707 --> 00:45:48.004
David Boder: And how old are you now?

00:45:48.004 --> 00:45:49.708
Gert Silberbart: I will be 18.

00:45:49.708 --> 00:45:52.979
David Boder: And what are your plans? What do you want to do in the future?

00:45:52.979 --> 00:46:02.356
Gert Silberbart: I am intending to finish the dental technician course and the evening course at the commercial school, and then go to my relatives in Chile and work there as a dental technician.

00:46:02.356 --> 00:46:05.070
David Boder: Don’t you want to study dentistry?

00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:13.588
Gert Silberbart: I don’t think I will have an opportunity to study dentistry because that requires the Maturität [general qualification for university entrance]. I am already too old and...

00:46:13.588 --> 00:46:14.568
David Boder: . . . too old...?

00:46:14.568 --> 00:46:19.679
Gert Silberbart: Not too old, but I just don’t have enough time anymore to prepare for that.

00:46:19.679 --> 00:46:26.870
David Boder: Well now, you are just a single person. You could maybe earn some money and work towards the Maturität, no?

00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:30.594
Gert Silberbart: I never had an opportunity to earn something, and I would not know as what or how.

00:46:30.594 --> 00:47:10.729
David Boder: Aha. Now, Gert, that was a very comprehensive report. I have heard some things from you that I had not heard from others, because I [interviewed] very few German prisoners. You also described things very intelligently. I am convinced that it is a good report, that I may play for certain German groups in Chicago. I am convinced that they will—I cannot say, they will be happy, but very satisfied to learn of this. Many thanks.

00:47:10.729 --> 00:47:11.368
Gert Silberbart: You are welcome...

00:47:11.368 --> 00:47:44.280
David Boder: [In English] This concludes the report with Gert Silberbart at, eh, about seven minutes of Spool 83. Paris, August the 27th 1946. In a home supported by the Swiss government for refugees of the war. Illinois Institute of Technology wire recording.

00:47:44.280 --> 00:48:12.095
David Boder: This concludes the reproduction of Spool 9-83, the interviewee was Silberbart. The sign-off gave by mistake Paris, it really was in Geneva but somehow the interviewer automatically having interviewed people for a number of days in Paris still gave the sign-off as Paris. It is Geneva...Switzerland. November the 14th, 1950, Chicago, of course. Boder.
