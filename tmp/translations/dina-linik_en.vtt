David Boder: [In English] Spool 9-130A. Dina and Wanda Linik, L-I-N-I-K. In Russian. November the 7th, 1950. Boder.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:02:02.596
David Boder: Paris, September the 13th, in eh...France, September the 13th, 1946. Hénonville, fifty kilometers from Paris in a home for displaced Jews, eh, eh, which is occupied by a kibbutz and also by a yeshiva. The interviewee is a Mrs. Dina Linik, em which is withholding her husband’s name, and she is going to report on her experiences, during the war in, which she had in, which she passed in Russia and then in [unintelligible] Poland.

00:02:02.596 --> 00:02:16.015
David Boder: [In Russian] Well, yes...[Unintelligible]. Madam Linik, could you please tell me where you were when the war began, what happened to you during the war and, and how you got here? Well...

00:02:16.015 --> 00:02:48.811
Dina Linik: When the war with the Germans began in 1941...I was in Kiev with my family, and...including my husband and two daughters, Sofia and Wanda. In July 1941, when the Germans were approaching Kiev, I fled to, eh...the Northern Caucasus, eh...together with my husband and children.

00:02:48.811 --> 00:02:49.505
David Boder: From Kiev?

00:02:49.505 --> 00:02:50.169
Dina Linik: From Kiev.

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:53.701
David Boder: Did the Russian government evacuate people...freely?

00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:58.397
Dina Linik: Evacuated with children...evacuated to the Northern Caucasus.

00:02:58.397 --> 00:03:00.238
David Boder: What about your husband, did they take him?

00:03:00.238 --> 00:03:01.898
Dina Linik: Please wait, I will explain it later [unintelligible].

00:03:01.898 --> 00:03:03.709
David Boder: Okay.

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:25.955
Dina Linik: We were living there for two and half months...before, eh...my husband...was recruited to the army. In September, 1941, my husband went to the front, leaving me with my two daughters. Should I tell you their age?

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:27.615
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:27.615 --> 00:03:33.289
Dina Linik: The older, Sofia, was thirteen, while the younger, Wanda, was six.

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.984
David Boder: When did it happen?

00:03:33.984 --> 00:03:34.304
Dina Linik: [Short pause]

00:03:34.304 --> 00:03:38.185
David Boder: [Unintelligible]

00:03:38.185 --> 00:04:19.720
Dina Linik: Five years. We were staying at the Northern Caucasus for four months, when Hitler’s troops approached again. They took Rostov, and were approaching the Caucasus. I had a hard time trying to evacuate from the Northern Caucasus with my children. Evacuate, since the local authorities caused much, very much trouble...and very much...very much, you know, they were creating obstacles to prevent us from evacuating and leaving this...Caucasus.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.398
David Boder: So, how did the people evacuate then?

00:04:21.398 --> 00:04:28.038
Dina Linik: The only way to leave the Caucasus was to go to the Caspian Sea.

00:04:28.038 --> 00:04:29.324
David Boder: How do you mean?

00:04:29.324 --> 00:04:31.455
Dina Linik: In...to Central Asia, to Central Asia.

00:04:31.455 --> 00:04:40.829
David Boder: So where...well, what happened then?

00:04:40.829 --> 00:04:47.560
Dina Linik: You ask what happened? We arrived in Makhanchakala, a port on the Caspian Sea.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.661
David Boder: Okay.

00:04:49.661 --> 00:05:01.057
Dina Linik: Dozens of thousands of people were lying around at the docks, on the streets.

00:05:01.057 --> 00:05:02.687
David Boder: Okay.

00:05:02.687 --> 00:05:13.281
Dina Linik: That was a terrible sight, terrible sight, of the Jewish disaster. People were lying for six-seven weeks at the docks under the rain...

00:05:13.281 --> 00:05:14.989
David Boder: It is important for us to know who those people were.

00:05:14.989 --> 00:05:15.683
Dina Linik: Jews.

00:05:15.683 --> 00:05:17.042
David Boder: Why Jews?

00:05:17.042 --> 00:05:22.432
Dina Linik: Because Hitler was after them, perfectly clear, they massacred all Jews...

00:05:22.432 --> 00:05:24.605
David Boder: Okay, so the Jews wanted to evacuate.

00:05:24.605 --> 00:05:33.569
Dina Linik: Therefore, the Jews wanted to evacuate. Each and every place, all docks, all havens, were filled up by Jewish families and children.

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:36.316
David Boder: Yes.

00:05:36.316 --> 00:05:48.920
Dina Linik: After going through much trouble, I got on board...a ship, well, not exactly a ship, but some transportation...

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:49.813
David Boder: . . . barge...

00:05:49.813 --> 00:06:02.791
Dina Linik: . . . transportation barge, which was extremely full of people, tighter then herring in a barrel, people were everywhere, in the hold, on the deck.

00:06:02.791 --> 00:06:05.417
David Boder: Okay.

00:06:05.417 --> 00:06:15.033
Dina Linik: The barge wasn’t de—...how do you call it...well, wasn’t designed...

00:06:15.033 --> 00:06:15.745
David Boder: . . . for carrying any passengers...

00:06:15.745 --> 00:06:26.067
Dina Linik: Yes...for the passengers, this type of cargo...also...I should add that the planes were attacking us all the time...

00:06:26.067 --> 00:06:26.641
David Boder: From where?

00:06:26.641 --> 00:06:32.212
Dina Linik: They tried...The planes were German, they tried to bomb us, bomb us along the way. This [unintelligible] was damaged slightly...

00:06:32.212 --> 00:06:33.178
David Boder: Okay.

00:06:33.178 --> 00:07:03.564
Dina Linik: . . . after that, a strong, six-degree storm began. The storm was tossing the ship like a toy. A few times, we thought that we were going to die. Various...confined space, this emotional stress...made...many people...many people died on this ship.

00:07:03.564 --> 00:07:04.850
David Boder: What, this [unintelligible]?

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:12.564
Dina Linik: Yes. Many people died from cardiac arrest. They couldn’t withstand the stress, you know...

00:07:12.564 --> 00:07:14.737
David Boder: How long [unintelligible] were you on that ship?

00:07:14.737 --> 00:07:40.817
Dina Linik: We...that ship was supposed to take us to the destination in sixteen hours, we had been at sea...for two and half days, open sea, before we arrived to Krasnovodsk. In Krasnovodsk, they put us on the railway carriages, various vehicles, to take us to different...different parts of Central Asia. We ended up in a kolkhoz [a form of collective farming in the Soviet Union] near Alma-Ata.

00:07:40.817 --> 00:07:42.175
David Boder: Okay.

00:07:42.175 --> 00:07:45.405
Dina Linik: I lived with my children for nine months there.

00:07:45.405 --> 00:07:46.449
David Boder: Okay. What did you do there?

00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:49.467
Dina Linik: I was working at the kolkhoz.

00:07:49.467 --> 00:07:50.222
David Boder: What did you do?

00:07:50.222 --> 00:08:00.532
Dina Linik: I was working in the field at the kolkhoz, harvesting wheat for bread, then worked at the canning factory, and I went through much trouble, much stress during this time.

00:08:00.532 --> 00:08:02.723
David Boder: And did you get any payment?

00:08:02.723 --> 00:08:41.602
Dina Linik: Payment...Naturally, they paid me with bread. They gave me the norm [unintelligible], we were equal to the kolkhoz workers in this sense. Then in 1942, I went back...yes, in 1942, 1943, and 1944, all this time I was in Central Asia. Then, in 1944, when Kiev was liberated from occupation, I went through [unintelligible] used help, you know, of the authorities to obtain permission to return to my home country.

00:08:41.602 --> 00:08:42.357
David Boder: To Kiev?

00:08:42.357 --> 00:08:43.371
Dina Linik: To Kiev.

00:08:43.371 --> 00:08:47.053
David Boder: And what were your children doing at the kolkhoz?

00:08:47.053 --> 00:08:51.550
Dina Linik: My older daughter was working and studying, while the younger was just studying at school.

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:57.315
David Boder: Okay. What were the life conditions at the kolkhoz?

00:08:57.315 --> 00:09:01.468
Dina Linik: What kind of general conditions would you expect from a kolkhoz? The same for everyone.

00:09:01.468 --> 00:09:07.160
David Boder: Yes. What kind of conditions were you living in? Were they good or bad?

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:21.496
Dina Linik: They were good, staying away from Hitler was already good enough. We believed “good” was to be anywhere but around Hitler. I escaped Hitler four times, and each time he caught up with us.

00:09:21.496 --> 00:09:22.884
David Boder: Which four times are those? From Kiev?

00:09:22.884 --> 00:09:49.880
Dina Linik: He caught up with us in Kiev, in the Northern Caucasus, then after the Northern Caucasus, I forgot to add, I was in Georgia too, he came close there too, and then I was in Central Asia, when I returned, as you may remember, from Rostov, he began his...their successful victories, and caught up with us on the road in this...in Rostov, I had hard time escaping from Hitler there too.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.709
David Boder: Well, okay.

00:09:51.709 --> 00:09:52.270
Dina Linik: And then...

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.262
David Boder: Did you hear from your husband, get any letters?

00:09:54.262 --> 00:10:28.541
Dina Linik: And from my husband...from husband, he left on September 3, I received five letters from him, and then he disappeared. I only know that he was near Poltava, where...their division was surrounded by the Germans. I don’t know what happened to him afterwards. I wrote to the government more than once, but they replied that he had disappeared without a trace. I believe that he would have returned, if he had been alive. I assume that he perished.

00:10:28.541 --> 00:10:35.543
David Boder: Do you think that he could find you if he was alive now? Is there anyone in Russia who knows where you live?

00:10:35.543 --> 00:10:55.422
Dina Linik: I waited for him in Kiev for a year and a half...in vain. I think that a year and a half is enough to hear any news about him or for him to find any news about us, he also had many friends and relatives who could have told him where we had been, if he had been alive.

00:10:55.422 --> 00:10:56.750
David Boder: So, they know where you are.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:03.813
Dina Linik: Yes. This is true now. I lived in Kiev for a year and a half.

00:11:03.813 --> 00:11:04.676
David Boder: In Kiev?

00:11:04.676 --> 00:11:05.280
Dina Linik: In Kiev.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.286
David Boder: Was the war over by that time or was it still in progress?

00:11:08.286 --> 00:11:09.554
Dina Linik: The war was over.

00:11:09.554 --> 00:11:11.987
David Boder: Oh! In which year did you return to Kiev?

00:11:11.987 --> 00:11:13.484
Dina Linik: In 1944.

00:11:13.484 --> 00:11:22.496
David Boder: Were the Germans ousted from Kiev in 1944? The war was over in 1945, and you still lived in Kiev. But how did you live in Kiev, how did you make your living?

00:11:22.496 --> 00:11:23.673
Dina Linik: I was working in Kiev.

00:11:23.673 --> 00:11:25.152
David Boder: Where?

00:11:25.152 --> 00:11:28.804
Dina Linik: I was working, working at the factories, at a plant...

00:11:28.804 --> 00:11:39.325
David Boder: What were the conditions there? You worked at the factory, and what did they pay you?

00:11:39.325 --> 00:11:41.921
Dina Linik: What did they pay me? They paid me a salary.

00:11:41.921 --> 00:11:45.108
David Boder: Yes. [Unintelligible] was it enough for you and two children?

00:11:45.108 --> 00:12:17.434
Dina Linik: No. I was poor and went through much trouble. I couldn’t make enough money for my children by myself. My children got sick after all this trouble, stress. My children got sick and weren’t able to withstand hunger, these hardships anymore. After that, I was included in the general list of, well, repatriated Polish citizens and left Kiev.

00:12:17.434 --> 00:12:18.219
David Boder: As a Pole?

00:12:18.219 --> 00:12:19.052
Dina Linik: As a Pole.

00:12:19.052 --> 00:12:20.398
David Boder: Were you born in Poland?

00:12:20.398 --> 00:12:23.175
Dina Linik: I was born in Poland.

00:12:23.175 --> 00:12:23.736
David Boder: Okay.

00:12:23.736 --> 00:12:50.237
Dina Linik: I left with my children...ended up in Krakow, where I lived for a short period of time, then based on...the message from my relatives in the U.S., Palestine...

00:12:50.237 --> 00:12:51.251
David Boder: Who do you have in Palestine?

00:12:51.251 --> 00:12:52.730
Dina Linik: My mother lives in Palestine.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:54.318
David Boder: Oh! Okay.

00:12:54.318 --> 00:13:30.933
Dina Linik: I have a sister and a brother in Palestine who were lucky to go there in 1922. I now want to go to Palestine, to my relatives, very much, but evidently I cannot do so due to the current political environment. I hope that in the near future I will be able to join my relatives...friends, my family, and provide a better living for my children, so that it is better than I had myself...

00:13:30.933 --> 00:13:32.189
David Boder: How do you mean?

00:13:32.189 --> 00:13:41.080
Dina Linik: I mean my childrens’ lives, I want them to live a better life...than I did.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:47.962
David Boder: Okay, you say that you want...And your sisters in Chicago speak Russian, don’t they?

00:13:47.962 --> 00:13:50.666
Dina Linik: My sisters left, when I was very y—...

00:13:50.666 --> 00:13:50.998
David Boder: Young.

00:13:50.998 --> 00:13:51.813
Dina Linik: Young.

00:13:51.813 --> 00:13:52.719
David Boder: And you don’t know if they speak it?

00:13:52.719 --> 00:14:07.224
Dina Linik: I remember them well. I doubt if they know Russian, because one of the sisters, Rachel, [unintelligible] has been living in Chicago for thirty-four years. The second sister has been living in Chicago since 1922.

00:14:07.224 --> 00:14:09.276
David Boder: [In German]...Please, we would like now to speak Yiddish.

00:14:09.276 --> 00:14:10.997
Dina Linik: . . . Yes, we would like to speak Yiddish.

00:14:10.997 --> 00:14:15.422
David Boder: [In Yiddish]...Well then, let’s speak Yiddish now...let’s speak Yiddish.

00:14:15.422 --> 00:14:15.422
David Boder: Eh, where did you go in Poland, after you left Kiev?

00:14:15.422 --> 00:14:19.333
Dina Linik: In, eh, we came to a Polish...

00:14:19.333 --> 00:14:21.959
David Boder: Where, where did you go, to which town?

00:14:21.959 --> 00:14:23.396
Dina Linik: To Krakow.

00:14:23.396 --> 00:14:24.440
David Boder: You came to Krakow?

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:32.589
Dina Linik: Yes, later we lived in Lodz, in Krakow, in Katowice, in Sosnowiec, traveled through all of Poland and...

00:14:32.589 --> 00:14:33.736
David Boder: And how did you make a living?

00:14:33.736 --> 00:14:40.074
Dina Linik: And, and one made a living on all of the support given by the American, eh, state.

00:14:40.074 --> 00:14:43.817
David Boder: Yes, all. And your women and girls were with you?

00:14:43.817 --> 00:15:06.048
Dina Linik: Yes. Later we came, also all thanks to the American state, [who] gave us such support, so that one could travel from Poland to Czechoslovakia, because also in Poland, as one knows, the general situation for the Jews was not very good. It happened that many Jews were killed in Poland while we were there.

00:15:06.048 --> 00:15:07.588
David Boder: Did you see it yourself?

00:15:07.588 --> 00:15:14.065
Dina Linik: One has seen everything. Yes. It happened before me, four Jewish kibbutzniks were killed in Lodz.

00:15:14.065 --> 00:15:15.381
David Boder: Yes, why?

00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:17.391
Dina Linik: For nothing. For being Jewish.

00:15:17.391 --> 00:15:17.693
David Boder: I see.

00:15:17.693 --> 00:15:33.556
Dina Linik: Nothing else. Only because they have Jewish names. Thus, one could see, that also in Poland there is no life for us; because they don’t leave the Jews alone, they don’t let them live in Poland, we were helped, and later we came to Czechoslovakia

00:15:33.556 --> 00:15:34.281
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:34.281 --> 00:15:42.146
Dina Linik: And in Czechoslovakia the French Government gave permission to travel into the country as passengers in transit, who continue to travel, transit.

00:15:42.146 --> 00:15:43.535
David Boder: I see.

00:15:43.535 --> 00:15:50.465
Dina Linik: Now we are in [unintelligible] That means we are in kibbutz Israel Agudath Poeli.

00:15:50.465 --> 00:15:51.328
David Boder: Agudath what?

00:15:51.328 --> 00:15:53.199
Dina Linik: Agudath Poeli Israel.

00:15:53.199 --> 00:15:54.044
David Boder: Poeli Israel.

00:15:54.044 --> 00:15:57.063
Dina Linik: Poeli Israel, named Netzach Israel.

00:15:57.063 --> 00:15:57.473
David Boder: I see.

00:15:57.473 --> 00:16:04.053
Dina Linik: We have been here already for four months, hoping to leave for Erez Israel.

00:16:04.053 --> 00:16:04.524
David Boder: I see.

00:16:04.524 --> 00:16:18.093
Dina Linik: I wanted, I have very much wanted to see my two sisters, who live in America, but I don’t know how this can happen, if they can help me travel to America.

00:16:18.093 --> 00:16:20.840
David Boder: I see, did they write to you?

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:35.925
Dina Linik: I received a letter from them, they asked me, maybe, maybe I need something, but since then they didn’t, they know that I have a sister with a younger brother in Erez Israel, as well as a mother in Erez Israel.

00:16:35.925 --> 00:16:36.245
David Boder: Yes.

00:16:36.245 --> 00:16:38.829
Dina Linik: [Unintelligible] but consequently I had wanted [it] so much.

00:16:38.829 --> 00:16:45.849
David Boder: I see. Here, maybe when you go to Erez Israel, for an American it would be easier for them to go there for a visit.

00:16:45.849 --> 00:16:46.845
Dina Linik: To America?

00:16:46.845 --> 00:16:49.290
David Boder: No, from America to Palestine.

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:49.821
Dina Linik: Yes.

00:16:49.821 --> 00:16:57.759
David Boder: Yet one travels, [unintelligible] it will calm down, and they will know the entire family is in Palestine. Will they come afterwards?

00:16:57.759 --> 00:16:58.924
Dina Linik: To Palestine?

00:16:58.924 --> 00:16:59.214
David Boder: Yes.

00:16:59.214 --> 00:17:00.107
Dina Linik: From America?

00:17:00.107 --> 00:17:02.371
David Boder: Yes. People travel very often. People travel a lot.

00:17:02.371 --> 00:17:05.286
Dina Linik: One can travel from Palestine to America?

00:17:05.286 --> 00:17:07.248
David Boder: Ah, here. From America to Palestine.

00:17:07.248 --> 00:17:09.814
Dina Linik: No, and from Palestine to America?

00:17:09.814 --> 00:17:18.917
David Boder: That is, yes, of course one can travel, but American citizens are usually free to travel to Palestine.

00:17:18.917 --> 00:17:31.008
Dina Linik: I mean, I don’t know if they can travel, they are two elderly people, not eighteen years old anymore, and to leave their own families, and they are very busy with their businesses, business-wise.

00:17:31.008 --> 00:17:34.708
David Boder: I see. And are both of your daughters here with you?

00:17:34.708 --> 00:17:35.734
Dina Linik: Yes.

00:17:35.734 --> 00:17:38.541
David Boder: Where did you join the kibbutz?

00:17:38.541 --> 00:17:45.272
Dina Linik: We have, we came to Poland and registered with the Agudah.

00:17:45.272 --> 00:17:45.743
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:45.743 --> 00:17:51.073
Dina Linik: In the Agudah, and the entire time we are very close to the Agudah.

00:17:51.073 --> 00:17:52.811
David Boder: And they brought you over?

00:17:52.811 --> 00:18:05.337
Dina Linik: Yes. The Agudah has brought us over from Poland to France, and until now they have seen to support us, until we can go to Erez Israel.

00:18:05.337 --> 00:18:12.900
David Boder: I see, how do I say that, you, you, and what do you do here the whole day? And what do the children do? How old are the children?

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:23.705
Dina Linik: Yes. In, in the kibbutz Netzach Israel [they] learn things, in economy, in the tailor shop.

00:18:23.705 --> 00:18:26.482
David Boder: With the, the village work-force?

00:18:26.482 --> 00:18:33.804
Dina Linik: Yes. Village work-force in tailor shop, among them, and the teacher is Madam, eh...

00:18:33.804 --> 00:18:34.305
David Boder: Lackstein.

00:18:34.305 --> 00:18:52.474
Dina Linik: Ah, à la Lackstein, she is very nice, a Jewish polite person, a good teacher for us and she sees as the Jew should, that each Jewish child should get some subjects and be able to work all over the world.

00:18:52.474 --> 00:18:53.138
David Boder: I see. And the children?

00:18:53.138 --> 00:19:13.368
Dina Linik: And my children. One daughter is still small, Wanda, she is ten years old, and she studies Ivrit [modern Hebrew], so when she comes to Erez Israel she can communicate with all people, and the older daughter studies also Ivrit and gardening.

00:19:13.368 --> 00:19:19.314
David Boder: I see, and she will, she will work in, in Erez Israel in a colony.

00:19:19.314 --> 00:19:36.415
Dina Linik: I can’t say what will happen, what one will give to us when we come to Erez Israel. But we hope that we will get to Erez Israel and one can do gardening, one can sew, is able to get by, there will be something that one will be able to do, one should become useful.

00:19:36.415 --> 00:19:38.938
David Boder: And where do you live here? Do you have a room for yourself?

00:19:38.938 --> 00:20:02.105
Dina Linik: Yes, in Agudah, in Netzach Israel, in the kibbutz, I have a room for myself and my two daughters, and bed linen, bed, food, and heating are provided for, and everything that is needed the Agudah cares for.

00:20:02.105 --> 00:20:06.650
David Boder: And so far, your sisters have not sent you any support? No money?

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:10.031
Dina Linik: I didn’t ask for it, because we are not hungry here.

00:20:10.031 --> 00:20:10.804
David Boder: I see.

00:20:10.804 --> 00:20:14.353
Dina Linik: One doesn’t live very great, how do I say that...

00:20:14.353 --> 00:20:15.168
David Boder: In luxury.

00:20:15.168 --> 00:20:31.255
Dina Linik: In luxury. We are not hungry, we have suffered very much from the Germans before the war, as one knows now, as it is said, how do I say, that one can already sleep calmly and no quarrel with arms, and, and...

00:20:31.255 --> 00:20:31.997
David Boder: With arms?

00:20:31.997 --> 00:20:40.418
Dina Linik: With arms. Yes, and no one, and they know when you are asleep at night that you are not risking your life, and you get up in the morning and you have a glass of tea before you, it is already, one is already with...

00:20:40.418 --> 00:20:46.744
David Boder: And where the work is in the kolkhoz have people behaved well? Behaved friendly?

00:20:46.744 --> 00:20:54.458
Dina Linik: How can they? What does it mean to behave friendly? How can they be friendly? Since they can come and take away from the Jews, I am asking you?

00:20:54.458 --> 00:20:55.816
David Boder: I am asking you?

00:20:55.816 --> 00:21:12.942
Dina Linik: One can not say friendly. But they accepted everything that their state did as right; they had a bit of a feeling of fear. But for the Jew or against the Jew they couldn’t do anything, because the state was on them, but friendly no, they said that Jews could go and look for Erez Israel.

00:21:12.942 --> 00:21:13.818
David Boder: The kolkhoz said that?

00:21:13.818 --> 00:21:19.691
Dina Linik: Yes. That Jews should look for a land.

00:21:19.691 --> 00:21:25.909
David Boder: I see. And what is, your elder daughter, eh, you say, do you want me to see her?

00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:28.251
Dina Linik: Yes, and I wanted you to send my regards to my sister.

00:21:28.251 --> 00:21:32.054
David Boder: Here, let’s bring both girls inside.
