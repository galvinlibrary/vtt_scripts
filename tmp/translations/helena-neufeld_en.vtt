00:00:00.594 --> 00:01:20.208
David Boder: [In English] For some reasons the first few words in this spool are missing. This is Spool 9-20. In other words this is a reproduction of the original Spool number 20. Boder.

00:01:20.208 --> 00:01:35.631
David Boder: [Missing: “This is Spool number 20, taken at the Jewish Committee’s home in Paris on Rue Guy Patin on August the 3rd, 1946. The person to be interviewed is Mrs. Helena Neufeld...”]...a young married woman. She understands a bit of English, German, and Yiddish, but she prefers, for fluency, to speak Polish. Eh...[unintelligible] eh, Mrs. Neufeld...

00:01:35.631 --> 00:01:50.167
David Boder: [In Russian] Tell me where you are from, and how did you come to Paris? Speak Polish.

00:01:50.167 --> 00:02:05.408
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] I was in Camp Belsen in Germany till the liberation. Afterwards I came to Paris where I have relatives, the only ones who remained alive.

00:02:05.408 --> 00:02:06.011
David Boder: [In Russian] Aha.

00:02:06.011 --> 00:02:09.448
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] The rest of the family in Poland was killed.

00:02:09.448 --> 00:02:11.378
David Boder: [In Russian] And where were you born?

00:02:11.378 --> 00:02:12.614
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] In Warsaw.

00:02:12.614 --> 00:02:22.981
David Boder: [In Russian] Yes. You were born in Warsaw. Tell me what happened when the Germans came there.

00:02:22.981 --> 00:03:38.818
Helena Neufeld: When the Germans arrived in Warsaw. I remained in Warsaw a short time, till October, ’39. In October I crossed the Soviet-German border. I went to Lwow. There I lived about a year and a half. Then I lived through the entry...the outbreak of the Soviet-German war. I wasn’t able to leave Lwow fast enough, because the evacuation took place very fast. I was trapped by the Germans in Lwow. There I lived through a terrible pogrom which took place in the first days after the Germans arrived.
I was in Lwow till [words not clear]...till the creation of the Ghetto in Lwow. Then I ran away from Lwow illegally, to Warsaw, because my family was living in Warsaw.

00:03:38.818 --> 00:03:45.331
David Boder: [In Russian] You said that there was a pogom in Lwow?

00:03:45.331 --> 00:04:21.346
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Yes. The pogrom in Lwow took place a few days after the Germans arrived. The Pogrom was carried out actually not by the Germans themselves, but mostly by the Ukrainians. It was really a bestial pogrom. The Ukr-...Ukrainians simply made use of the old Polish system. They beat people to death with clubs. They killed children. There were many Jewish victims at that time.

00:04:21.346 --> 00:04:24.271
David Boder: [In Russian] The Germans allowed them to make a pogrom?

00:04:24.271 --> 00:04:39.603
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] The Germans? [Chuckle.] It had actually been arranged by the Germans. But the Germans preferred not to take an active part, but they preferred that it should look like a spontaneous uprising of the Ukrainians.

00:04:39.603 --> 00:04:43.206
David Boder: [In Russian] How did you return to Warsaw?

00:04:43.206 --> 00:05:12.387
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Warsaw...to Warsaw I traveled actually as an Aryan, as a Polish woman, a Catholic. However, I didn’t have any documents. Since I look quite a bit like a Jewess, the trip was dangerous. In Cracow on the railroad station—it was twelve o’clock at night—some Folk-German, that means...eh...eh...a Folk-German...

00:05:12.387 --> 00:05:13.337
David Boder: [In Russian] Yes?

00:05:13.337 --> 00:05:58.279
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish]...a German informer, yes, he caught me. He asked me for papers. I didn’t have any papers. I found myself at the Gestapo, but by accident, thanks to that, that I had met there some railway official, a Pole, a very fine and descent person, I succeeded in getting out. He accompanied me to the station, and I went to Warsaw. In Warsaw, too, at that time Jews were not permitted to go to the so-called Aryan side. They locked me up in the ghetto. But somehow I succeeded in crossing the...the Polish section, and I got in...I got into the ghetto through an opening in the wall.

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:01.581
David Boder: [In Russian] Were you married then?

00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:02.380
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] No, I wasn’t married.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.511
David Boder: [In Russian] You weren’t married.

00:06:03.511 --> 00:06:04.220
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] No.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.733
David Boder: [In Russian] In Warsaw you lived in the Ghetto?

00:06:07.733 --> 00:06:19.778
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Yes. I was in the Warsaw Ghetto from November, ’41, throughout the entire time till the resettlement action.

00:06:19.778 --> 00:06:25.175
David Boder: [In Russian] Tell me, how was life in the Warsaw Ghetto?

00:06:25.175 --> 00:06:29.004
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Upon first coming into the Ghetto...

00:06:29.004 --> 00:06:29.607
David Boder: [In Russian] Yes.

00:06:29.607 --> 00:07:24.771
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] I cannot describe the shocking impression it had aroused in me. At once I came upon sights which I later encountered much too often, but which I shall never be able to forget. There were many houses in ruins inside the Ghetto. Jewish children were sitting among the ruins, pale, emaciated, like skeletons, thin little hands and legs. And [they] were begging. With thin little voices they were begging for bread. This was, I remember, my first impression. The second, and an equally shocking one, was [the fact] that all the people were wearing armbands on the arms. It was a strange world of people with armbands. But people were behaving as if that was normal. They were moving about...

00:07:24.771 --> 00:07:29.505
David Boder: [In Russian] What? [For some reason there is a chuckle in which both participate.] Yes. And how long were you in the Ghetto?

00:07:29.505 --> 00:07:46.570
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] I was in the Ghetto till the moment of the main action, that means till Jul-...till the 22nd of July, 1942. Then I lived through there the entire action.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:51.694
David Boder: [In Russian] Wait a moment. Who was with you? Was your father there? Your mother? Who else was there?

00:07:51.694 --> 00:08:16.508
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] No. When I arrived in Warsaw my father wasn’t alive any more, and my brother had been killed by the Germans. My brother had been very early taken away. In ’40 yet the Germans had taken many Jewish intellectuals as hostages and shot them afterwards. So that I was [there] with my mother and my sister.

00:08:16.508 --> 00:08:23.263
David Boder: [In Russian] Aha. And where was your father? Eh...how did your father...did your father die before, or what?

00:08:23.263 --> 00:08:32.565
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] My father died a few months after the outbreak of the war. I do not know exactly when, because I was in Lwow. He was a very frail man. He had lived through the bombing...

00:08:32.565 --> 00:08:33.032
David Boder: [In Russian] Aha.

00:08:33.032 --> 00:08:37.947
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish]...of Warsaw. And he was altogether a very delicate person, and everything that he saw...

00:08:37.947 --> 00:08:38.264
David Boder: [In Russian] Aha.

00:08:38.264 --> 00:08:43.676
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish]...and things were looking very bad, and that made his condition worse, so that he died a few months later.

00:08:43.676 --> 00:08:47.023
David Boder: [In Russian] What was your father’s occupation? What did your family live on before the war?

00:08:47.023 --> 00:08:49.269
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] My father was a teacher.

00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:49.902
David Boder: [In Russian] What?

00:08:49.902 --> 00:08:51.983
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] My father was a teacher.

00:08:51.983 --> 00:08:55.224
David Boder: [In Russian] A teacher? What did he teach?

00:08:55.224 --> 00:09:02.249
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Father taught the Polish language, mathematics, in the public schools for Jewish children.

00:09:02.249 --> 00:09:06.621
David Boder: [In Russian] Aha. And he himself, what did he finish [what training did he have] ?

00:09:06.621 --> 00:09:19.902
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] My father studied in schools established by Jewish synagogues for Jews who wanted to receive a liberal education.

00:09:19.902 --> 00:09:20.219
David Boder: [In Russian] Aha.

00:09:20.219 --> 00:09:26.294
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] And afterwards he passed a teacher’s examination with a certain Polish professor.

00:09:26.294 --> 00:09:26.807
David Boder: [In Russian] Aha.

00:09:26.807 --> 00:09:28.722
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] He received a teacher’s diploma.

00:09:28.722 --> 00:09:32.235
David Boder: [In Russian] That means he died before the Germans entered Poland?

00:09:32.235 --> 00:09:33.004
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Yes. He died a few...

00:09:33.004 --> 00:09:34.406
David Boder: [In Russian] Where did he die, in Warsaw?

00:09:34.406 --> 00:09:35.371
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] In Warsaw.

00:09:35.371 --> 00:09:38.642
David Boder: [In Russian] Aha. Nu, and...did he die in the Ghetto?

00:09:38.642 --> 00:09:40.451
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] There was no Ghetto yet.

00:09:40.451 --> 00:09:41.657
David Boder: [In Polish] There was no Ghetto yet.

00:09:41.657 --> 00:09:46.150
David Boder: [In Russian] So you were in the Ghetto. With whom were you in the Ghetto.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:49.723
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] With [my] mother, with [my] sister, and with [my] sister’s husband.

00:09:49.723 --> 00:09:51.969
David Boder: [In Russian] Where did you live?

00:09:51.969 --> 00:09:55.165
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] We lived on Nowolipia, in...

00:09:55.165 --> 00:09:56.552
David Boder: [In Russian] In a house?

00:09:56.552 --> 00:10:01.979
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] In our apartment. That apartment...Nowolipia belonged to the Ghetto.

00:10:01.979 --> 00:10:04.301
David Boder: [In Russian] Aha. So you remained in your apartment...

00:10:04.301 --> 00:10:05.432
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Yes.

00:10:05.432 --> 00:10:07.467
David Boder: [In Russian]...because Nowolipia was made a part of the Ghetto.

00:10:07.467 --> 00:10:07.708
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Yes.

00:10:07.708 --> 00:10:16.226
David Boder: [In Russian] All right. That house belonged to whom? [Pause.] Well, who was the landlord of the house?

00:10:16.226 --> 00:10:19.091
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Nu, there was the owner of the house. Before the war he was...

00:10:19.091 --> 00:10:19.950
David Boder: [In Russian] A Jew or...

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:22.061
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] It was a Jew. [Words not clear.]

00:10:22.061 --> 00:10:26.719
David Boder: [In Russian] Yes. And did you pay rent?

00:10:26.719 --> 00:10:31.332
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] In the beginning we paid and later on...I don’t remember.

00:10:31.332 --> 00:10:35.131
David Boder: [In Russian] All right. When did you go into the Ghetto?

00:10:35.131 --> 00:10:51.435
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Then the resettlement action started, on the 22nd of July, 1942. At that time...we were hiding a little...

00:10:51.435 --> 00:10:52.400
David Boder: [In Russian] In the Ghetto?

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:59.516
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] In the Ghetto itself. If the action took place on one street, we would go over to the next street.

00:10:59.516 --> 00:11:02.787
David Boder: [In Russian] What kind of action was it? Tell me about the action.

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:52.241
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Then appeared...the Germans...posters appeared upon the walls, even signed by the Jewish Community Council, that all the Jews have to report to resettlement points, and they will be resettled to the East. Everyone will receive three kilos of bread, a kilo of marmalade. RR-cars will be supplied, and in these RR-cars the Germans...[correction] the Jews will go to the East. There they will be settled in small towns, and there they will work. Next it was mentioned that the Jews who are working in German plants are exempted from this resettlement. Next, the workers in the Jewish Community Council...I don’t remember. My husband...

00:11:52.241 --> 00:11:56.447
David Boder: [In Russian] And there, what...Were there any hospitals in the Ghetto? Were there doctors?

00:11:56.447 --> 00:12:15.472
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Yes. There were hospitals in the Ghetto. There were doctors. Only the sick were dying simply of hunger. There was little medicine. Even if they did succeed in curing a sick person, there still was no food to nurse him back to health, so that there was a very high mortality.

00:12:15.472 --> 00:12:18.922
David Boder: [In Russian] And where to...where were the people buried?

00:12:18.922 --> 00:12:20.038
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] What is that?

00:12:20.038 --> 00:12:23.611
David Boder: [In Russian] Where were they buried? [In German] Where were they buried?

00:12:23.611 --> 00:12:27.184
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Oh. People were buried in the Jewish cemetery.

00:12:27.184 --> 00:12:35.973
David Boder: [In German/English] Was...was the Jewish cemetery inside the Ghetto?

00:12:35.973 --> 00:12:47.476
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] The Jewish cemetery was a little outside the Ghetto, but passes could be gotten, and one could...even the family could accompany the deceased.

00:12:47.476 --> 00:12:47.853
David Boder: [In Russian] Yes.

00:12:47.853 --> 00:12:53.235
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Yes. And they could be buried in the cemetery on Gesia [Street] , in the old Jewish cemetery.

00:12:53.235 --> 00:12:53.823
David Boder: [In Russian] Aha.

00:12:53.823 --> 00:13:10.119
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] The poor were buried in communal graves. There were huge communal graves, because the mortality toward the end was around five thousand people a month, and those who could afford it were buried in individual graves.

00:13:10.119 --> 00:13:15.366
David Boder: [In Russian] Yes. Nu? Afterwards how did you leave the Ghetto?

00:13:15.366 --> 00:13:49.270
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Afterwards, after the first action, I remained, because there was...there had remained around forty thousand Jews after the first action. Of them a part was left in a few German plants in which were manufactured uniforms for the army, shoes, fur coats, and so forth. I was able to hide myself. I was working there in a kind of factory dispensary.

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:50.416
David Boder: [In Russian] Hm.

00:13:50.416 --> 00:15:12.022
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] I was in the Ghetto till January, ’43. In January the second action broke out, and in January I escaped to the Aryan side during the course of the second action. Also the escape was very dangerous, but we drove out in a factory truck. I pretending to be a worker of that factory. There was a check point, that means a gate in the wall. There stood German gendarmes checking on everybody leaving the Ghetto. Well, just as the truck was driving out, as SS patrol which was carrying out the action drove by. Everybody was told to get out of the truck. We were searched. I was the only woman. All the men were sure that I would be taken away to the distribution depot. That was the assembly place where all the Jews were being assembled. But for some strange reason they permitted me to get back on the truck, and we drove away. Near Pulaski Street the truck stopped. I had friends there, Aryans. I got out of the truck, and in this way I left the Ghettov.

00:15:12.022 --> 00:15:16.937
David Boder: [In Russian] What happened then? Continue, please.

00:15:16.937 --> 00:15:49.469
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Nu, it was very difficult for me to hide, because I have a very Semitic appearance. The Poles with whom I was hiding received me well, but I had to change my lodgings several times. The last time I was living on Muranowski Street right across from the Ghetto. Well, and that is how I was able to see the German action of April, ’43, the uprising of the Warsaw Ghetto.

00:15:49.469 --> 00:15:50.133
David Boder: [In Russian] Yes.

00:15:50.133 --> 00:15:51.475
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Because our windows...

00:15:51.475 --> 00:15:53.450
David Boder: [In Russian] Did you live there during the uprising?

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:55.545
Helena Neufeld: I lived vis-a-vis. I saw [it]

00:15:55.545 --> 00:15:58.983
David Boder: Yes, you saw [it] Now tell about the uprising.

00:15:58.983 --> 00:18:05.741
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Our windows faced directly the corner of Muranowska and Nalewki Streets. In this way we could observe the whole Muranowska Square, part of Nalewki [Street] , and, I think, Mila Street which led precisely to that distribution depot where all the Jews were assembled. So that I was able to see all the Jewish convoys which the Germans were leading to the distribution depot. On the 18th of April in the morning shots were suddenly heard. We didn’t know what was going on. We went over to the windows. We saw that the wall of the Ghetto was thickly surrounded by numerous patrols. Each patrol ordinarily consisted of one German, one Ukrainian, and one Polish policeman. The patrols were ten, fifteen feet apart, and I don’t remember if each or every other patrol had a machine gun. We knew right away that an action in the Ghetto was in the offing, because every action always began by just such an encirclement of the entire wall. Well, and there began a regular battle, a very furious battle. At first we heard machine guns, then grenades. Suddenly we heard a familiar...I heard a familiar noise, but I couldn’t believe that they were tanks. I looked on Nalewki [Street] , and there, indeed, two German tanks were slowly driving into Nalewki. Well, that meant the end of the Ghetto.

00:18:05.741 --> 00:18:11.937
David Boder: [In Russian] Tell me, what happened to you afterwards? How long were you in Warsaw, and how did you get out of Warsaw?

00:18:11.937 --> 00:18:57.238
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Afterwards I was still hiding for some time, but it was very difficult for me to hide. Later on the Germans took us to...took me to the lager, to Bergen-Belsen. This was in July in the year ’43. In this lager I was twenty months, over twenty months, till around the 13th of April of the year ’45. At that time they started to evacuate the camp. It seemed that the English were approaching. We were evacuated on the 10th of April. Two weeks I was in the train, until the 23rd of April.

00:18:57.238 --> 00:18:59.620
David Boder: [In Russian] You were evacuated from Belsen.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:00.284
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Yes.

00:19:00.284 --> 00:19:01.445
David Boder: [In Russian] Who?

00:19:01.445 --> 00:19:09.269
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] The Germans. The Germans were in the habit of evacuating all the camps which the English or the Americans were approaching, provided they had time.

00:19:09.269 --> 00:19:09.812
David Boder: [In Russian] Hm.

00:19:09.812 --> 00:19:13.747
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] They began to evacuate Belsen, too, and I was evacuated.

00:19:13.747 --> 00:19:16.054
David Boder: [In Russian] Did they know in Belsen that you are a Jewess?

00:19:16.054 --> 00:19:29.275
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Yes. In Belsen there were very many Jews. There were Polish Jews, Hungarian Jews, Rumanian Jews, Yugoslavian, Dutch Jews.

00:19:29.275 --> 00:19:34.129
David Boder: [In Russian] Aha. How long were you in Belsen?

00:19:34.129 --> 00:19:36.843
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Over twenty months.

00:19:36.843 --> 00:19:37.974
David Boder: [In Russian] How many?

00:19:37.974 --> 00:19:39.738
Helena Neufeld: Over twenty months.

00:19:39.738 --> 00:19:40.658
David Boder: Twenty months?

00:19:40.658 --> 00:19:41.186
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Yes.

00:19:41.186 --> 00:19:47.533
David Boder: [In Russian] Tell me about the life in Belsen. How were you living in your block and so forth?

00:19:47.533 --> 00:19:49.086
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] So...

00:19:49.086 --> 00:19:50.006
David Boder: [In Russian] Did you work in Belsen?

00:19:50.006 --> 00:19:51.197
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] No, we didn’t...

00:19:51.197 --> 00:19:51.393
David Boder: [In Russian] No.

00:19:51.393 --> 00:19:51.890
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish]...work.

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:54.574
David Boder: [In Russian] That means you didn’t work for twenty months?

00:19:54.574 --> 00:19:55.102
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] No.

00:19:55.102 --> 00:19:58.826
David Boder: [In Russian] How many people were in a block?

00:19:58.826 --> 00:20:21.364
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] In the beginning there were...we were kept separately, the Polish Jews. This was a group of over two thousand five hundred persons, in the beginning. Later on they began...in October, after three months, they sent out over a thousand people from our group.

00:20:21.364 --> 00:20:22.555
David Boder: [In Russian] Hm.

00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:28.299
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] About two thousand people. Later we found out that they were sent to Auschwitz.

00:20:28.299 --> 00:20:31.721
David Boder: [In Russian] How did you sleep there in the barracks?

00:20:31.721 --> 00:20:38.234
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] In the beginning conditions were still a little better. It wasn’t that crowded, and every one of us had his plank bed.

00:20:38.234 --> 00:20:39.968
David Boder: [In Russian] Yes?

00:20:39.968 --> 00:21:03.350
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] But the plank beds were two-tiered, a lower one and an upper one, very closely set. One couldn’t turn around. The spaces between them were very narrow. This fatigued us very much. We covered ourselves with blankets. We had such paillasses. We received a soup, bread, sometimes a little margarine.

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:05.295
David Boder: [In Russian] What did you do all day?

00:21:05.295 --> 00:21:12.757
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Nothing, nothing. Our group didn’t work. There were groups which worked, and which didn’t work.

00:21:12.757 --> 00:21:18.154
David Boder: [In Russian] Did you know in Belsen that woman...What was she called?...eh...

00:21:18.154 --> 00:21:19.179
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Irma...

00:21:19.179 --> 00:21:20.747
David Boder: [In Russian] Irma Gray, or...[reference to Irma Grese]

00:21:20.747 --> 00:21:24.305
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] No, I didn’t know her, but I knew the Commandant Kramer.

00:21:24.305 --> 00:21:25.722
David Boder: [In Russian] You did know Kramer?

00:21:25.722 --> 00:21:34.984
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Yes. I saw him a few times. In the beginning we had a different Commandant, Kass [?] , and afterwards Kramer took his place.

00:21:34.984 --> 00:21:35.467
David Boder: [In Russian] Hm.

00:21:35.467 --> 00:21:36.537
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Yes.

00:21:36.537 --> 00:21:40.065
David Boder: [In Russian] Yes. And you, were you in good health in Belsen?

00:21:40.065 --> 00:21:48.824
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] No. In Belsen...I arrived in Belsen already sick, because I had been in prison for two weeks in Warsaw, in the Pawiak [Prison]

00:21:48.824 --> 00:21:49.593
David Boder: [In Russian] Hm.

00:21:49.593 --> 00:22:30.719
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Well, and besides, I had gone through a great deal during the time when I was hiding. I arrived sick, and later on...everybody was sick, because we got very little food, so that everybody was very weak. At first we received food. Later on it became worse and worse. The first year we lived through somehow, even though during the winter we lived in stone barracks. It was cold. The roofs were leaky. Water was pouring in.

00:22:30.719 --> 00:22:37.518
David Boder: [In Russian] Yes. Tell me, if anybody got sick what did they do then?

00:22:37.518 --> 00:22:57.855
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] There were...among the prisoners there were doctors. They treated the sick, and besides that there was a large hospital. In case there were any serious cases it was reported to the German doctor. Well, and the sick were taken to the hospital.

00:22:57.855 --> 00:23:03.719
David Boder: [In Russian] Yes. And later on you were evacuated from Belsen. Where to?

00:23:03.719 --> 00:23:18.041
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] The train was traveling there and back, there and back. Because all the roads were out and were bombed. Railroad stations were burning, so that...the train was supposed to go to Theresenstadt, to Czechoslovakia.

00:23:18.041 --> 00:23:18.689
David Boder: [In German] Czech—...

00:23:18.689 --> 00:23:27.523
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Yes. But it didn’t travel very far, because the engineer couldn’t run the train on the bombed out roads.

00:23:27.523 --> 00:23:28.277
David Boder: [In Russian] Yes. [Words not clear.]

00:23:28.277 --> 00:23:31.594
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] There were air raids. No? There were air raids. We were bombed.

00:23:31.594 --> 00:23:33.659
David Boder: [In Russian] You didn’t go to Theresenstadt?

00:23:33.659 --> 00:23:34.081
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] No.

00:23:34.081 --> 00:23:34.217
David Boder: [In Russian] No.

00:23:34.217 --> 00:23:34.745
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] We were of course...

00:23:34.745 --> 00:23:36.629
David Boder: [In Russian] And who liberated you?

00:23:36.629 --> 00:23:37.926
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] The Russians.

00:23:37.926 --> 00:23:38.846
David Boder: [In Russian] The Russians?

00:23:38.846 --> 00:23:39.555
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Yes.

00:23:39.555 --> 00:23:44.575
David Boder: [In Russian] The Russians liberated you. Tell [me] , how did it happen?

00:23:44.575 --> 00:23:45.811
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] During one...

00:23:45.811 --> 00:23:47.168
David Boder: [In Russian] Were you in trains?

00:23:47.168 --> 00:24:11.534
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] We were in RR-cars, in a freight car, even during the night. All night the train was standing. It was even quite peaceful. From afar shots could be heard, but there was no air raid. Early in the morning, around six, someone ran past our RR-car and said, ‘The Russians are already here.’

00:24:11.534 --> 00:24:12.182
David Boder: [In Russian] Aha.

00:24:12.182 --> 00:24:13.720
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] The Germans had already run away.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.358
David Boder: [In Russian] Did the Russians feed you?

00:24:16.358 --> 00:24:34.901
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Yes. Then all the people ran out of the RR-cars, and there really were two Russian soldiers on horses. And they said, ‘You can leave the RR-cars now. Everybody can go to the village. There you will find...go into the houses. There...’

00:24:34.901 --> 00:24:36.876
David Boder: [In Russian] In what town was that?

00:24:36.876 --> 00:24:43.464
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] It was...somewhat around Falkenburg, near Theresenstadt.

00:24:43.464 --> 00:24:43.871
David Boder: [In Russian] Aha.

00:24:43.871 --> 00:24:44.534
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] A small town.

00:24:44.534 --> 00:24:48.273
David Boder: [In Russian] All right. After the liberation where did you go from there?

00:24:48.273 --> 00:24:51.017
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] We were very sick then.

00:24:51.017 --> 00:24:52.751
David Boder: [In Russian] Your sister was with you?

00:24:52.751 --> 00:24:54.756
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] No, there was no one from my family, no one.

00:24:54.756 --> 00:24:55.359
David Boder: [In Russian] Yes.

00:24:55.359 --> 00:25:07.359
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Then we went to the nearest German village. There we went into a German house. First of all we bathed and climbed into beds and [chuckle] lay in the beds.

00:25:07.359 --> 00:25:11.460
David Boder: [In Russian] Yes. And from there where did you go?

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:23.023
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] We lay...a month’s time we lay there, because we had no strength to walk. We were very weak, and afterwards I went to Paris.

00:25:23.023 --> 00:25:24.787
David Boder: [In Russian] Why did you go to Paris? You have...

00:25:24.787 --> 00:25:38.521
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Because in Poland I had no family. I knew, of course, my mother had perished during the action. And my sister I also knew had perished. So that I went to Paris where I have family.

00:25:38.521 --> 00:25:40.345
David Boder: [In Russian] You do have family in Paris?

00:25:40.345 --> 00:25:41.913
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] I have two [female] cousins.

00:25:41.913 --> 00:25:43.466
David Boder: [In Russian] You have two cousins here...

00:25:43.466 --> 00:25:43.572
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Yes.

00:25:43.572 --> 00:25:44.160
David Boder: [In Russian]...in Paris.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:44.477
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Yes.

00:25:44.477 --> 00:25:49.799
David Boder: [In Russian] And what do you intend to...Where did you get married?

00:25:49.799 --> 00:25:53.251
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] I got married in the Ghetto.

00:25:53.251 --> 00:25:55.090
David Boder: [In Russian] Oh! You got married in the Ghetto.

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:55.452
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Yes.

00:25:55.452 --> 00:25:56.628
David Boder: [In Russian] And what happened to your husband?

00:25:56.628 --> 00:25:59.432
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] My husband was also in a lager.

00:25:59.432 --> 00:26:00.307
David Boder: [In Russian] Where?

00:26:00.307 --> 00:26:02.312
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] He was also...he was in Belsen.

00:26:02.312 --> 00:26:06.895
David Boder: [In Russian] Oh. They sent men and women. Did the Germans know that he was your husband?

00:26:06.895 --> 00:26:11.222
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Yes. Yes, they knew that he was my husband.

00:26:11.222 --> 00:26:17.719
David Boder: [In Russian] And he went with you together all the time, and arrived in Belsen? And from Belsen you were evacuated...

00:26:17.719 --> 00:26:23.931
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] In Belsen, there we lived separately. And then we were again together. And then we were evacuated.

00:26:23.931 --> 00:26:26.750
David Boder: [In Russian] And you were together...And when the Russsians arrived you were together?

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:27.745
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Yes. Everybody...

00:26:27.745 --> 00:26:31.936
David Boder: [In Russian] Yes, you were together. And then you two decided to go to Paris.

00:26:31.936 --> 00:26:32.358
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Yes.

00:26:32.358 --> 00:26:34.408
David Boder: [In Russian] How did you travel? Did you have money?

00:26:34.408 --> 00:26:46.318
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] No, we had no money whatsoever, but we traveled without money all the time. In military cars and later in trains for the repatriates.

00:26:46.318 --> 00:26:48.805
David Boder: [In Russian] Did they allow you to enter France, or you...

00:26:48.805 --> 00:26:52.484
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] They let us in. I speak a little French, and I have family in Paris.

00:26:52.484 --> 00:26:54.549
David Boder: [In Russian] Where did you learn to speak French?

00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:57.564
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] I learned it in school yet. I liked the French language very much.

00:26:57.564 --> 00:26:59.343
David Boder: [In Russian] Did you attend the gymnasium in Warsaw?

00:26:59.343 --> 00:27:00.037
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Yes.

00:27:00.037 --> 00:27:02.042
David Boder: [In Russian] Yes. And where did your husband study?

00:27:02.042 --> 00:27:03.308
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Also in Warsaw.

00:27:03.308 --> 00:27:06.444
David Boder: [In Russian] How come he knows English?

00:27:06.444 --> 00:27:08.193
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] He studied English.

00:27:08.193 --> 00:27:12.942
David Boder: [In Russian] Aha, and what does your husband do in Paris?

00:27:12.942 --> 00:27:21.218
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Well, in the beginning we didn’t do anything. We weren’t feeling well. Now he is working a little as an interpreter.

00:27:21.218 --> 00:27:24.445
David Boder: [In Russian] Aha, and what do you intend to do?

00:27:24.445 --> 00:27:36.219
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] We don’t know yet. It is a very hard decision. We have friends in America who want us very much to come over. I don’t have any family anywhere else. Maybe I will remain in Paris. We don’t know yet.

00:27:36.219 --> 00:27:38.526
David Boder: [In Russian] Aha. You have relatives in America?

00:27:38.526 --> 00:27:42.400
Helena Neufeld: No. Just girl friends.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.179
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] In America I have friends, a girl friend.

00:27:44.179 --> 00:27:48.431
David Boder: [In Russian] But you have no relatives. And your husband, what is his occupation? What does he do?

00:27:48.431 --> 00:27:50.587
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] He was working as an interpreter.

00:27:50.587 --> 00:27:51.296
David Boder: [In Russian] What is that?

00:27:51.296 --> 00:27:53.934
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] With the Americans.

00:27:53.934 --> 00:27:54.989
David Boder: [In Russian] With the Americans?

00:27:54.989 --> 00:27:58.065
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Here. In Americans institutions, because he knows English.

00:27:58.065 --> 00:27:59.377
David Boder: [In Russian] What institutions?

00:27:59.377 --> 00:28:01.653
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] I don’t even know.

00:28:01.653 --> 00:28:05.965
David Boder: [In Russian] For the American government or for Jewish organizations?

00:28:05.965 --> 00:28:10.563
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] No, no. They aren’t...I don’t know whether for Polish or for American.

00:28:10.563 --> 00:28:13.412
David Boder: [In Russian] Yes. He is working for them.

00:28:13.412 --> 00:28:14.076
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Yes.

00:28:14.076 --> 00:28:15.749
David Boder: [In Russian] And he will return home by ten o’clock?

00:28:15.749 --> 00:28:17.166
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Yes. He will return...

00:28:17.166 --> 00:28:26.875
David Boder: [In Russian] [Words not clear.] Tell me, in Belsen did you have any songs which the prisoners were singing?

00:28:26.875 --> 00:28:27.734
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] We?

00:28:27.734 --> 00:28:29.996
David Boder: [In Russian] Yes.

00:28:29.996 --> 00:28:31.971
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Songs? Very few...

00:28:31.971 --> 00:28:33.916
David Boder: [In Russian] Yes. Jewish or...

00:28:33.916 --> 00:28:35.017
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Yes, there were.

00:28:35.017 --> 00:28:38.288
David Boder: [In Russian]...new songs which were composed there in the lager?

00:28:38.288 --> 00:28:41.394
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] No, no, no, no.

00:28:41.394 --> 00:28:42.072
David Boder: [In Russian] You don’t know any?

00:28:42.072 --> 00:28:46.384
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] No, no. By us...Of course, people wrote verse.

00:28:46.384 --> 00:28:46.881
David Boder: [In Russian] What?

00:28:46.881 --> 00:28:48.902
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Verse. [In Russian] Verse.

00:28:48.902 --> 00:28:49.520
David Boder: [In Russian] People wrote.

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:49.942
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Yes.

00:28:49.942 --> 00:28:51.812
David Boder: [In Russian] Did you also write poetry? Do you know any?

00:28:51.812 --> 00:28:55.807
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] No, I didn’t write [any] Maybe my husband will remember some.

00:28:55.807 --> 00:28:57.812
David Boder: [In Russian] Do you know any?

00:28:57.812 --> 00:28:58.717
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] No.

00:28:58.717 --> 00:29:00.358
David Boder: [In Russian] You don’t know any.

00:29:00.358 --> 00:29:56.366
David Boder: [In English] Well, this concludes the record of Mrs. Helena Neufeld. She insists on making her record in Polish. She is apparently conscious about her language. And she is saying that she married her husband in the ghetto of Warsaw. And it so happened that during all the deportations they were together. August the 3rd, 1946. Paris. The home for adult Jews...After concluding the record, how so many...how [it] often happens, you have some new data. On the question ‘What is she working in?’ she tells me she is a dentist, graduated from Warsaw.

00:29:56.366 --> 00:30:02.487
David Boder: [In German] When did you study dentistry?

00:30:02.487 --> 00:30:04.100
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] [Words not clear.]

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:07.236
David Boder: [In Russian] When did you study in Warsaw? How long ago?

00:30:07.236 --> 00:30:19.311
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] I studied from 1931 to the end of 1935. From 1931 to the end of 1935.

00:30:19.311 --> 00:30:21.603
David Boder: [In Russian] How old are you now?

00:30:21.603 --> 00:30:23.978
Helena Neufeld: Thirty-three.

00:30:23.978 --> 00:30:25.266
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] Trzydzieści trzy.

00:30:25.266 --> 00:30:31.869
David Boder: [In Russian] Did you enter a technical school in Warsaw? When? Right after the gymnasium?

00:30:31.869 --> 00:30:47.846
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] No. I really didn’t want to study for a dentist. One year I studied Romantics, I wanted to travel abroad, to France, but my parents insisted that I study for a dentist, so then...

00:30:47.846 --> 00:30:48.359
David Boder: [In Russian] Aha.

00:30:48.359 --> 00:30:49.173
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish]...after a year, after...

00:30:49.173 --> 00:30:55.474
David Boder: [In Russian] Where are you working here? For a dentist, or are you working for yourself?

00:30:55.474 --> 00:30:54.563
Helena Neufeld: [In Polish] For myself. I can’t [words not clear]
