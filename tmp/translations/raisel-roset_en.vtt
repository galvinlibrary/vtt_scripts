Raisel Roset: Yes.

00:00:29.165 --> 00:00:31.305
David Boder: Are you married?

00:00:31.305 --> 00:00:31.680
Raisel Roset: Yes.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.039
David Boder: Where is your husband?

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:52.959
Raisel Roset: He was in the occup—...he was in the occupied parts of Poland, and when the German-Russian war broke out...since then there was no word from him; and now, unfortunately, I have learned that he had fallen.

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:53.881
David Boder: . . . had fallen.

00:00:53.881 --> 00:00:56.224
Raisel Roset: He has perished, he was put to death.

00:00:56.224 --> 00:00:56.771
David Boder: Where?

00:00:56.771 --> 00:00:58.974
Raisel Roset: That I don’t know yet.

00:00:58.974 --> 00:01:00.692
David Boder: So how were you informed?

00:01:00.692 --> 00:01:04.224
Raisel Roset: I learned about it. A cousin from Poland has notified me about it.

00:01:04.224 --> 00:01:04.724
David Boder: Yes.

00:01:04.724 --> 00:01:05.958
Raisel Roset: He was put to death in Kremenets.

00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:12.114
David Boder: Ah...you have a cousin in Poland? [a female cousin]

00:01:12.114 --> 00:01:14.801
Raisel Roset: A cousin of my husband.

00:01:14.801 --> 00:01:17.019
David Boder: In Russian Poland or in free Poland? [Certain sections of Poland were to go over to Russia permanently—east of the Curzon line]

00:01:17.019 --> 00:01:19.534
Raisel Roset: In free Poland.

00:01:19.534 --> 00:01:28.065
David Boder: In free Poland. Now tell me, when did the Germans come...Where did you live?

00:01:28.065 --> 00:01:30.190
Raisel Roset: I—in Janow [?]

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.315
David Boder: In...?

00:01:31.315 --> 00:01:34.409
Raisel Roset: . . . district of Lublin, Weimar [?], district of Lublin.

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.268
David Boder: . . . district of Lublin. And that was Poland.

00:01:36.268 --> 00:01:37.315
Raisel Roset: Yes.

00:01:37.315 --> 00:01:40.112
David Boder: Yes. And who marched in there, the Russians?

00:01:40.112 --> 00:01:40.705
Raisel Roset: The Germans.

00:01:40.705 --> 00:01:42.470
David Boder: The Germans. Now tell me.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:49.662
Raisel Roset: There were a few days, the Germans came in the 6th of ________. After a few days they left Janow and the Russians came in.

00:01:49.662 --> 00:01:50.631
David Boder: Ah.

00:01:50.631 --> 00:02:13.144
Raisel Roset: And then my husband went away with them[?] As president of the Zionist organization—and they were the first to be sent to concentration camps, so he left together with the Russians, for Dubno [?].

00:02:13.144 --> 00:02:13.988
David Boder: Ah.

00:02:13.988 --> 00:02:16.488
Raisel Roset: And afterwards for Kremenets.

00:02:16.488 --> 00:02:17.113
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:17.113 --> 00:02:29.022
Raisel Roset: All the time I received letters from him, but afterwards when the German-Russian war broke out, the correspondence was cut short.

00:02:29.022 --> 00:02:29.694
David Boder: Nu...

00:02:29.694 --> 00:02:42.087
Raisel Roset: I sent a special messenger to him; and he, in spite of being my relative [?] has deceived me, and told me that my husband has gone into Russia, deep into Russia.

00:02:42.087 --> 00:02:42.633
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:48.164
Raisel Roset: I felt reassured. And then started our troubles in Poland.

00:02:48.164 --> 00:02:52.898
David Boder: So who do you think killed your husband?

00:02:52.898 --> 00:02:55.351
Raisel Roset: I don’t know yet.

00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:56.288
David Boder: The Germans or the Russians?

00:02:56.288 --> 00:02:59.225
Raisel Roset: I don’t know it yet. I have not yet found out.

00:02:59.225 --> 00:02:59.819
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.131
Raisel Roset: Because they still are searching for me [??]

00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:04.256
David Boder: Ah.

00:03:04.256 --> 00:03:10.178
Raisel Roset: And then started by us the compulsory translocation.

00:03:10.178 --> 00:03:11.537
David Boder: That was ordered by the Germans?

00:03:11.537 --> 00:03:17.880
Raisel Roset: Yes. By the order of translocation the city of Janow was made completely Jew clean.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.489
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:32.457
Raisel Roset: And all [Jewish] inhabitants of Janow were sent to a little town, twenty kilometers from Janow, to Yldiza [?] There the same thing started. One translocation followed after the other.

00:03:32.457 --> 00:03:34.222
David Boder: Nu.

00:03:34.222 --> 00:03:43.268
Raisel Roset: One day we noticed that our president of the Jewish council had run away. Then we understood that the liquidation has come [??]

00:03:43.268 --> 00:03:44.096
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:44.096 --> 00:03:48.096
Raisel Roset: And whoever...who had a chance saved himself, of course.

00:03:48.096 --> 00:03:44.096
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:44.096 --> 00:03:55.802
Raisel Roset: I, in hopes that my man was in Russia...so I obtained Aryan papers.

00:03:55.802 --> 00:03:57.114
David Boder: What kind of papers? [The term was not familiar to the interviewer—hence the question.]

00:03:57.114 --> 00:03:57.848
Raisel Roset: Aryan

00:03:57.848 --> 00:03:58.973
David Boder: Aryan papers...

00:03:58.973 --> 00:04:00.333
Raisel Roset: And ran away.

00:04:00.333 --> 00:04:00.974
David Boder: Aha.

00:04:00.974 --> 00:04:41.179
Raisel Roset: I ran to a Polish family I knew, and there I was six weeks. Afterwards, they did not want to keep me any more, because they were also in danger from the Germans if I should be found with them. So I picked up my kit and kaboodle and wandered on. So I went to Czestochowa. In Czestochowa I was a few weeks, rambled around, a day here, a night there [nit getogt, nit gen chtigt] in the cold, wandering day long in the streets, it was hard to find a room. And I saw that this neither was a solution for me, and I went back to the Jew-lager.

00:04:41.179 --> 00:04:42.101
David Boder: Ah...

00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:44.444
Raisel Roset: Into the ghetto, back into the Jewish ghetto.

00:04:44.444 --> 00:04:45.053
David Boder: Yes.

00:04:45.053 --> 00:04:58.647
Raisel Roset: In the Jewish ghetto again the suffering began. Again deportations. I...they registered me for work in an ammunition factory. There I worked five months.

00:04:58.647 --> 00:04:59.413
David Boder: Yes.

00:04:59.413 --> 00:05:17.079
Raisel Roset: Afterwards I heard [a rumor] that there will be a selection. The older ones. They of course would be sent to gas chambers, and the younger ones were to remain. And I as an older women understood that the end was coming.

00:05:17.079 --> 00:05:18.173
David Boder: Yes.

00:05:18.173 --> 00:05:33.001
Raisel Roset: So I again started to look for means of salvation...I got myself again Aryan papers and escaped from Czestochowa. And then I was deported from the Polish side to Germany as an Aryan [woman], for work. There...

00:05:33.001 --> 00:05:35.876
David Boder: Why did they deport the Aryans?

00:05:35.876 --> 00:05:36.892
Raisel Roset: The Germans?

00:05:36.892 --> 00:05:37.783
David Boder: Yes.

00:05:37.783 --> 00:05:41.470
Raisel Roset: They deported me as an Aryan woman to Germany for work.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.345
David Boder: They...took you for a German?

00:05:43.345 --> 00:05:45.033
Raisel Roset: . . . for a Polish woman.

00:05:45.033 --> 00:05:47.564
David Boder: Aha, as a Polish woman. Nu.

00:05:47.564 --> 00:05:52.079
Raisel Roset: I arrived in Germany and from there to Lorain.

00:05:52.079 --> 00:05:59.057
David Boder: Ah.

00:05:59.057 --> 00:05:59.494
Raisel Roset: Where?

00:05:59.494 --> 00:06:00.494
Raisel Roset: In a field.

00:06:00.494 --> 00:06:01.150
David Boder: Aha...

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.915
Raisel Roset: And there I worked for twenty months, a hard job [?].

00:06:05.915 --> 00:06:08.337
David Boder: What kind of work was that?

00:06:08.337 --> 00:06:09.946
Raisel Roset: Work on the earth.

00:06:09.946 --> 00:06:11.743
David Boder: Work on the earth, work in the field?

00:06:11.743 --> 00:06:17.319
Raisel Roset: Work on the earth, work in the gardens, around the home [?] everywhere...

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:20.209
David Boder: Oh, you worked as a house servant.

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:25.380
Raisel Roset: Housework, in the garden in the field, everywhere I worked.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.771
David Boder: Yes. With whom, with the family?

00:06:26.771 --> 00:06:39.895
Raisel Roset: With other people. There were others. There was a Russian girl, a deportee. There were two war prisoners. And together with them I worked for twenty months. Very, very hard work.

00:06:39.895 --> 00:06:42.082
David Boder: Excuse me, for wom did you work.

00:06:42.082 --> 00:06:43.519
Raisel Roset: [excited] For the farmer.

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:46.222
David Boder: For the German...for a German farmer?

00:06:46.222 --> 00:06:47.800
Raisel Roset: Yes. Afterwards...

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.144
David Boder: Did he treat you correctly. Did he...?

00:06:52.144 --> 00:06:53.925
Raisel Roset: He—yes. She [treated me] very bad.

00:06:53.925 --> 00:06:54.972
David Boder: And...

00:06:54.972 --> 00:07:01.566
Raisel Roset: I even had not enough to eat. I hungered many times. She was a very bad woman.

00:07:01.566 --> 00:07:02.722
David Boder: And he?

00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:04.019
Raisel Roset: He not, he not [he was not bad].

00:07:04.019 --> 00:07:04.706
David Boder: All right. [The first few days in France the interviewer automatically used many English words in his questions]

00:07:04.706 --> 00:07:17.596
Raisel Roset: And then, after twenty months of hard work, this region was [subsequently] occupied by the Americans—and they have liberated me.

00:07:17.596 --> 00:07:19.268
David Boder: After twenty months.

00:07:19.268 --> 00:07:21.034
Raisel Roset: After twenty months of work.

00:07:21.034 --> 00:07:21.425
David Boder: Aha.

00:07:21.425 --> 00:07:25.409
Raisel Roset: They have liberated me, and sent me to Paris.

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:26.237
David Boder: Where?

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:28.299
Raisel Roset: To France, they sent me to France.

00:07:28.299 --> 00:07:29.033
David Boder: The Americans? [She could have been left in a DP camp in Germany].

00:07:29.033 --> 00:07:29.454
Raisel Roset: Yes.

00:07:29.454 --> 00:07:30.423
David Boder: Why?

00:07:30.423 --> 00:07:36.673
Raisel Roset: I pleaded with them, I want to go to France. I don’t want to be anymore with the Germans, and work for them further...

00:07:36.673 --> 00:07:39.048
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:39.048 --> 00:07:43.126
Raisel Roset: Here I learned of my great misfortune.

00:07:43.126 --> 00:07:43.798
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:43.798 --> 00:07:58.127
Raisel Roset: I learned about my whole family. From a large [?] family I remained the only one. And my sisters and bothers, and children and everybody. And the worst I learned was that my man was killed as I have told you.

00:07:58.127 --> 00:08:03.174
David Boder: Ah. Now tell me Mrs. Roset, what was you husband’s occupation before?

00:08:03.174 --> 00:08:05.205
Raisel Roset: He had a dry goods business.

00:08:05.205 --> 00:08:06.251
David Boder: Where?

00:08:06.251 --> 00:08:07.017
Raisel Roset: In Janow [She pronounces it like Zamoz].

00:08:07.017 --> 00:08:07.783
David Boder: In Zamoz?

00:08:07.783 --> 00:08:08.408
Raisel Roset: Yes.

00:08:08.408 --> 00:08:13.345
David Boder: And you say that was with the Zionist organization?

00:08:13.345 --> 00:08:15.923
Raisel Roset: President of the Zionist organization in Janow.

00:08:15.923 --> 00:08:18.798
David Boder: All right. Did you have any children? Did you...

00:08:18.798 --> 00:08:19.157
Raisel Roset: No.

00:08:19.157 --> 00:08:20.251
David Boder: You were a childless family?

00:08:20.251 --> 00:08:21.439
Raisel Roset: Childless...yes.

00:08:21.439 --> 00:08:22.595
David Boder: Have you any brothers or sisters?

00:08:22.595 --> 00:08:29.126
Raisel Roset: Two brothers, three sisters with husbands, wives, children, all killed by the Germans.

00:08:29.126 --> 00:08:33.329
David Boder: Were you in a concentration camp?

00:08:33.329 --> 00:08:35.110
Raisel Roset: I was not.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:35.595
David Boder: Nu.

00:08:35.595 --> 00:08:40.157
Raisel Roset: I was in a labor lager in Czestochowa, and from there I ran away. Yes.

00:08:40.157 --> 00:08:44.188
David Boder: What was that labor lager in Czestochowa. Tell me about it.

00:08:44.188 --> 00:08:53.984
Raisel Roset: That was a lager...when the action was made in Czestochowa, they left from fifty thousand Jews—[a mere] four thousand.

00:08:53.984 --> 00:08:55.422
David Boder: And what happened to the others.

00:08:55.422 --> 00:09:24.499
Raisel Roset: The others were sent away to the crematories and the gas chambers. And they assigned for these four thousand a small part of the city, a few small streets; these were fenced in with barbed wire, and there they lived. The workers from Janow [??] had to work all the time in the factories.

00:09:24.499 --> 00:09:26.452
David Boder: In what kind of factories did they work?

00:09:26.452 --> 00:09:34.671
Raisel Roset: They worked in the Norovitz [??] factory, and worked in the factory Hossak [??]...

00:09:34.671 --> 00:09:36.202
David Boder: What?

00:09:36.202 --> 00:09:37.577
Raisel Roset: Hossak, a munition factory.

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:39.843
David Boder: You say Norovitz’s factory...?

00:09:39.843 --> 00:09:40.546
Raisel Roset: Norovitz’s.

00:09:40.546 --> 00:09:41.828
David Boder: Who was Norovitz?

00:09:41.828 --> 00:09:46.546
Raisel Roset: All factories were converted in munition factories, of course.

00:09:46.546 --> 00:09:49.357
David Boder: Ah, yes. And there,...

00:09:49.357 --> 00:10:02.163
Raisel Roset: And there the Jews worked. And afterwards selections were taking place, deportations took place. Some were deported, others...they acted, of course, they way they pleased.

00:10:02.163 --> 00:10:10.594
David Boder: Yes. Now tell me, in these...you worked in a factory, and where did you sleep at night?

00:10:10.594 --> 00:10:14.591
Raisel Roset: At seven in the morning one had to be in the factory.

00:10:14.591 --> 00:10:15.091
David Boder: Yes.

00:10:15.091 --> 00:10:35.403
Raisel Roset: That was a few kilometers away. At six in the morning the gates of the ghetto were opened, for the labor lager. All workers were let out, and they would go to work. Seven o’clock in the evening, they would return home into the lager [ghetto and lager are apparently used interchangeably]. And there everybody had his corner [then follows the Hebrew word for place—mokum].

00:10:35.403 --> 00:10:36.215
David Boder: What?

00:10:36.215 --> 00:10:39.464
Raisel Roset: The mokum, which everybody was given, there one lived.

00:10:39.464 --> 00:10:42.885
David Boder: Aha. Now tell where did they eat.

00:10:42.885 --> 00:10:44.526
Raisel Roset: They ate at the factory.

00:10:44.526 --> 00:10:47.276
David Boder: In the morning, and...?

00:10:47.276 --> 00:10:49.995
Raisel Roset: In the morning, and at midday...

00:10:49.995 --> 00:10:52.869
David Boder: Did they pay any money for the work?

00:10:52.869 --> 00:10:57.165
Raisel Roset: They did not pay. I am telling you. They only gave food.

00:10:57.165 --> 00:11:02.255
David Boder: Well if one needed something, some soap, cigarets, or such things...

00:11:02.255 --> 00:11:03.442
Raisel Roset: [she mumbles something like] We got nothing.

00:11:03.442 --> 00:11:04.024
David Boder: Nothing [??].

00:11:04.024 --> 00:11:07.602
Raisel Roset: [an emotional sentence—not clear]

00:11:07.602 --> 00:11:14.805
David Boder: Yes. Did the Jews have there their prayer meetings, their synagogues? Did they have that in the ghetto?

00:11:14.805 --> 00:11:18.461
Raisel Roset: In the ghetto, no?

00:11:18.461 --> 00:11:20.164
David Boder: No? That was not permitted?

00:11:20.164 --> 00:11:23.398
Raisel Roset: No. That was a labor lager.

00:11:23.398 --> 00:11:26.820
David Boder: Aha. And they worked on Saturday and Sunday?

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.664
Raisel Roset: Of course. Of course.

00:11:29.664 --> 00:11:35.055
David Boder: Aha. Now, do you have relatives here in Paris?

00:11:35.055 --> 00:11:37.367
Raisel Roset: Here? I have nobody.

00:11:37.367 --> 00:11:42.445
David Boder: You have nobody here. You simply have asked the Americans to send you.

00:11:42.445 --> 00:11:44.960
Raisel Roset: I heard that here there are already Jews.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:45.398
David Boder: Aha.

00:11:45.398 --> 00:11:58.303
Raisel Roset: . . . and that is why I asked, that they send me to Paris. And to Paris I came as an Aryan [woman]. Only here I appealed to a Jewish society, and I revealed that I am Jewish born.

00:11:58.303 --> 00:12:03.974
David Boder: Now tell me, you lived as an Aryan [woman]. Did you live all the time in the lager as an Aryan woman?

00:12:03.974 --> 00:12:06.349
Raisel Roset: In the labor camp I was a Jewess.

00:12:06.349 --> 00:12:08.193
David Boder: As a Jewess. But with the farmer...

00:12:08.193 --> 00:12:10.880
Raisel Roset: With the farmer I was an Aryan, of course.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:17.489
David Boder: Were they compelling you...did they want you to go to church, did they?

00:12:17.489 --> 00:12:19.192
Raisel Roset: Yes, I went a few times...

00:12:19.192 --> 00:12:20.004
David Boder: To the Catholic [church]?

00:12:20.004 --> 00:12:20.598
Raisel Roset: Yes.

00:12:20.598 --> 00:12:26.676
David Boder: Nu. Tell me, did they treat the Poles the same way as the Jews?

00:12:26.676 --> 00:12:37.519
Raisel Roset: Oh...no. The Poles were deported just for work, but the Jews were killed; very simply.

00:12:37.519 --> 00:12:37.878
David Boder: But...

00:12:37.878 --> 00:12:51.893
Raisel Roset: The Jews, when they were deported, were deported to the gas chambers, to the crematories. When the Poles were deported, they were deported to Germany, for work. That is why I had the Aryan papers, so that I should not be sent away...

00:12:51.893 --> 00:12:52.987
David Boder: Who gave you the Aryan papers?

00:12:52.987 --> 00:12:54.237
Raisel Roset: For money.

00:12:54.237 --> 00:12:56.361
David Boder: For money, aha...

00:12:56.361 --> 00:12:57.829
Raisel Roset: They were made [forged?].

00:12:57.829 --> 00:13:03.422
David Boder: Aha...and then you came to Paris, and here you came to whom?

00:13:03.422 --> 00:13:26.920
Raisel Roset: Here...I told you, I came to a French shelter; from there I was reported to the Polish consulate; and there I told them that I was a Jewess, and I asked them for an address of a Jewish society because I wanted...and so they gave it to me, and I went to...Boulevard d’Italien.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:27.936
David Boder: What was there?

00:13:27.936 --> 00:13:50.028
Raisel Roset: Yes. The Jewish society, and they later placed me in Famille [two words not clear] that was a home for the deported, and there I stayed for a considerable time.

00:13:50.028 --> 00:13:59.044
David Boder: Yes. And the, where do you live now?

00:13:59.044 --> 00:14:07.803
Raisel Roset: Now...afterwards, I was assigned to various bureaus [the last few words are not clear] and I went over to live on _______________ [she gives an address in French].

00:14:07.803 --> 00:14:08.928
David Boder: And what is that?

00:14:08.928 --> 00:14:10.707
Raisel Roset: . . . where I live up to this day.

00:14:10.707 --> 00:14:12.815
David Boder: And what is that? A private [place/?

00:14:12.815 --> 00:14:22.047
Raisel Roset: Now there is...no, that too was a home for the deported, but afterwards the consistoire has taken it over; because there is a seminary, a Rabbi’s seminary.

00:14:22.047 --> 00:14:22.984
David Boder: Aha...

00:14:22.984 --> 00:14:29.921
Raisel Roset: . . . and I...I requested that they give me work, and I remained living there.

00:14:29.921 --> 00:14:31.046
David Boder: And what kind of work are you doing?

00:14:31.046 --> 00:14:31.843
Raisel Roset: As a cook.

00:14:31.843 --> 00:14:37.171
David Boder: You work there as a cook...you are cooking there...and you are coming here in the evening?

00:14:37.171 --> 00:14:39.312
Raisel Roset: And here, I learn a trade in the evening.

00:14:39.312 --> 00:14:39.968
David Boder: That is with the ORT.

00:14:39.968 --> 00:14:40.389
Raisel Roset: Yes.

00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:41.607
David Boder: And what are you learning here?

00:14:41.607 --> 00:14:42.841
Raisel Roset: . . . here? Corsets.

00:14:42.841 --> 00:14:47.356
David Boder: Corsets...and after you have learned it, what do you want to do?

00:14:47.356 --> 00:14:51.949
Raisel Roset: I have registered already a year ago to go to Palestine...

00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:53.433
David Boder: You have registered to go to Pales—...

00:14:53.433 --> 00:14:56.464
Raisel Roset: Yes...long ago [??] have I registered...

00:14:56.464 --> 00:14:57.230
David Boder: Whom do you have in Palestine?

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.652
Raisel Roset: There I have a cousin [feminine].

00:14:58.652 --> 00:15:00.339
David Boder: Have you written to her?

00:15:00.339 --> 00:15:00.948
Raisel Roset: Yes.

00:15:00.948 --> 00:15:02.713
David Boder: Does she want you to come?

00:15:02.713 --> 00:15:03.634
Raisel Roset: But of course.

00:15:03.634 --> 00:15:08.290
David Boder: With your experience in farm work it should be all right.

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:14.868
Raisel Roset: Oh yes, I should do it gladly, but what can I do, if I still have no permit to go...

00:15:14.868 --> 00:15:16.962
David Boder: Oh, now it will come soon...[Note: During the first few interviews an exploratory attempt was made to give the TAT. This was given up because it was time consuming, and did not directly fit into the plans of the project. —D.P.B.]

00:15:16.962 --> 00:15:34.977
David Boder: Will you do me a favor...I am a professor, and I am making a study of these things...you see this picture? What do you think it is, what is it about?

00:15:34.977 --> 00:15:37.414
Raisel Roset: What it is? [not clear]

00:15:37.414 --> 00:15:44.991
David Boder: Yes, what does it mean? What do you think it is, or could it be?

00:15:44.991 --> 00:15:49.319
Raisel Roset: Possibly a mother who has lost her children.

00:15:49.319 --> 00:15:54.959
David Boder: A mother who has lost her children. And what is this?

00:15:54.959 --> 00:15:57.521
Raisel Roset: That is a boy, a child.

00:15:57.521 --> 00:16:00.412
David Boder: Yes...and what is it about?

00:16:00.412 --> 00:16:08.599
Raisel Roset: He thinks of a melody.

00:16:08.599 --> 00:16:11.614
David Boder: Hm. And this?

00:16:11.614 --> 00:16:17.817
Raisel Roset: That is a dying [person]

00:16:17.817 --> 00:16:18.364
David Boder: Yes...

00:16:18.364 --> 00:16:24.535
Raisel Roset: And he...they bless him.

00:16:24.535 --> 00:16:28.613
David Boder: Hm...and this?

00:16:28.613 --> 00:16:36.768
Raisel Roset: [In a solemn tone] People are running away from somewhere.

00:16:36.768 --> 00:16:37.065
David Boder: Hm...

00:16:37.065 --> 00:16:39.550
Raisel Roset: People are running away from somewhere. [Unfortunately the number of the card has not been recorded].

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:42.332
David Boder: So...and this?

00:16:42.332 --> 00:17:08.884
Raisel Roset: That is possibly the land of dreams.
