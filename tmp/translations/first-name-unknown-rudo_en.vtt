[first name unknown] Rudo: Because of the War in Spain.

00:01:08.103 --> 00:01:15.462
David Boder: And what was your participation in the Spanish War that made you come here?

00:01:15.462 --> 00:01:23.258
[first name unknown] Rudo: Well, we were evacuated because Franco was on the other side...er...we had to be evacuated because of the bombs and all those problems.

00:01:23.258 --> 00:01:23.914

David Boder: Yes.

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:30.350
[first name unknown] Rudo: And that is why I came here.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.021
David Boder: Why don’t you return to Spain?

00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:37.130
[first name unknown] Rudo: I have no family there, and it is better to wait, you know.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.473

David Boder: You have no one.

00:01:40.676 --> 00:01:42.988
[first name unknown] Rudo: I have no one, and it is better for me to wait because...

00:01:42.988 --> 00:01:45.535
David Boder: Yes. What happened to your family?

00:01:45.535 --> 00:01:48.441
[first name unknown] Rudo: It has been a long time...they are not alive.

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:52.253
David Boder: So they did not die as a consequence of the war...

00:01:52.253 --> 00:01:53.284
[first name unknown] Rudo: No, they did not.

00:01:53.284 --> 00:01:55.706
David Boder: So you were also alone when you were there.

00:01:55.706 --> 00:01:57.659
[first name unknown] Rudo: Yes. I was alone during the whole war.

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.925
David Boder: OK. And what do you do in France?

00:02:00.925 --> 00:02:09.190
[first name unknown] Rudo: Well, now I am here at the [unintelligible] Center...I suffered a lot from rheumatism, I am still suffering...but I am much better.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.752
David Boder: Right.

00:02:09.752 --> 00:02:14.814
[first name unknown] Rudo: And I keep telling to myself...if I can stay here...I will stay and see if I get better.

00:02:14.814 --> 00:02:20.111
David Boder: I see. And what trade are you learning here?

00:02:20.111 --> 00:02:21.205
[first name unknown] Rudo: Sewing.

00:02:21.205 --> 00:02:24.548
David Boder: Sewing. So you want to learn how to sew.

00:02:24.548 --> 00:02:32.032
[first name unknown] Rudo: Yes. I know how to sew, but I do not have a sewing machine, and I need to practice...so that I can work later...for other people.

00:02:32.032 --> 00:02:36.500
David Boder: Right. And how long do you think it will take you to learn?

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.343
[first name unknown] Rudo: I don’t know. I think it takes two months...

00:02:39.343 --> 00:02:53.858
David Boder: OK. Now, tell me something about the war, The Spanish Civil War...In the Northern area, were there many...

00:02:53.858 --> 00:02:57.795
[first name unknown] Rudo: I have never been to the North, I have always been...I am from Catalonia.

00:02:57.795 --> 00:02:58.451
David Boder: Oh.

00:02:58.451 --> 00:02:59.513
[first name unknown] Rudo: I have always been in Barcelona.

00:02:59.513 --> 00:03:03.153
David Boder: All right, then. Were there many acts of war in Barcelona?

00:03:03.153 --> 00:03:04.559
[first name unknown] Rudo: Yes! Lots of dead people [unintelligible].

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:10.168
David Boder: And were did you go from Barcelona?

00:03:10.168 --> 00:03:16.543
[first name unknown] Rudo: Oh! When the war started, I was in Sant Cugat del Vallès, a town near Barcelona.

00:03:16.543 --> 00:03:16.856
David Boder: OK

00:03:16.856 --> 00:03:18.715
[first name unknown] Rudo: Of course, I did not see many things.

00:03:18.715 --> 00:03:19.325
David Boder: You didn’t...

00:03:19.325 --> 00:03:29.715
[first name unknown] Rudo: Well, I heard lots of stories, and when everything was calmer...well, I went to...to Barcelona, to the family I used to live with. I was their cook, you know?

00:03:29.715 --> 00:03:31.309
David Boder: Oh! So you were working as a cook with a family.

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.997
[first name unknown] Rudo: Yes.

00:03:31.997 --> 00:03:34.434
David Boder: And where did that family go?

00:03:34.434 --> 00:03:40.464
[first name unknown] Rudo: They took off some time later...they took off, they were scared and they took off.

00:03:40.464 --> 00:03:42.214
David Boder: Where did...

00:03:42.214 --> 00:03:49.590
[first name unknown] Rudo: They went to Barcelona, and when they were in Barcelona, they told us...”we are leaving”...I was a cook, and they had another girl, and they said they were moving...

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.043
David Boder: Right.

00:03:50.043 --> 00:03:52.215
[first name unknown] Rudo: The said they did not have any money...and...

00:03:52.215 --> 00:03:53.668
David Boder: Right.

00:03:53.668 --> 00:03:55.934
[first name unknown] Rudo: . . . she said her husband was not working...er...

00:03:55.934 --> 00:03:57.059
David Boder: Are there many foreign people in...?

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.637
[first name unknown] Rudo: The [unintelligible] Center?

00:03:57.637 --> 00:03:59.043
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:59.043 --> 00:04:05.495
[first name unknown] Rudo: Oh. Today...I think there are around forty here, from Paris. They are sick, you know.

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:05.917
David Boder: Right.

00:04:05.917 --> 00:04:08.026
[first name unknown] Rudo: Er...They have been deported...

00:04:08.026 --> 00:04:08.745
David Boder: Oh.

00:04:08.745 --> 00:04:20.775
[first name unknown] Rudo: And of course, they cannot do the work they were doing before...because of all the things they have been through...many of them are learning a new job...and they can do it more easily.

00:04:20.775 --> 00:04:25.556
David Boder: Are you planning to stay here in France...for how long?

00:04:25.556 --> 00:04:29.196
[first name unknown] Rudo: I’m not sure. May be I will stay, because I am alone, you see?

00:04:29.196 --> 00:04:29.634
David Boder: Oh.

00:04:29.634 --> 00:04:31.727
[first name unknown] Rudo: And I have been abroad for a long time and I have nothing.

00:04:31.727 --> 00:04:32.414
David Boder: Right.

00:04:32.414 --> 00:04:36.054
[first name unknown] Rudo: If I find a good job, I will stay here. Why would I leave?

00:04:36.054 --> 00:04:39.335
David Boder: Do you have better chances of finding a job here than in Spain?

00:04:39.335 --> 00:04:40.678
[first name unknown] Rudo: Pardon me.

00:04:40.678 --> 00:04:44.849
David Boder: Do you have better chances of finding a job here than in Spain?

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:45.755
[first name unknown] Rudo: Yes, of course.

00:04:45.755 --> 00:04:46.662
David Boder: Better...

00:04:46.662 --> 00:04:47.350
[first name unknown] Rudo: Yes. Much better.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:55.459
David Boder: Right. But in the meantime, you are with an organization that supports you, right?

00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:57.678
David Boder: Oh. Yes. Er...[The name of the Center is unintelligible].

00:04:57.678 --> 00:04:59.631
David Boder: What is that?

00:04:59.631 --> 00:05:08.521
[first name unknown] Rudo: [Unintelligible] is a center for deported people. There used to be also foreign people, but there are only [unintelligible] now.

00:05:08.521 --> 00:05:09.303
David Boder: [Unintelligible]

00:05:09.303 --> 00:05:22.427
[first name unknown] Rudo: And since many of them now have their families here, why would they stay at the center? They have gone to their own houses. Only homeless people stay there, until they find...er...a job.

00:05:22.427 --> 00:05:25.395
David Boder: And where and how did you live through the war here in France?

00:05:25.395 --> 00:05:30.082
[first name unknown] Rudo: [Laughing] Just like the others!

00:05:30.082 --> 00:05:33.722
David Boder: And where were you when the Germans came here?

00:05:33.722 --> 00:05:41.128
[first name unknown] Rudo: I was in Corbie...In Corbie, and then I left with a girl friend to Amiens.

00:05:41.128 --> 00:05:42.362
David Boder: Amiens...

00:05:42.362 --> 00:05:42.830
[first name unknown] Rudo: Right. Amiens...

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:43.642
David Boder: So you left.

00:05:43.642 --> 00:05:48.704
[first name unknown] Rudo: Yes. In Corbie there were barrack huts with Spanish refugees. It was a [unintelligible].

00:05:48.704 --> 00:05:49.313
David Boder: Oh.

00:05:49.313 --> 00:06:09.843
[first name unknown] Rudo: I wanted to start working in a house. I was tired of being a refugee, I wanted to work...Ithought to myself “This is not living”. I started working in a house, and I worked there for about a month. I was really scared of the arrival of Germans...so I said: “Oh! What am I going to do here?” And I knew there was a Spanish girl in Amiens.

00:06:09.843 --> 00:06:10.484
David Boder: Right.

00:06:10.484 --> 00:06:29.732
[first name unknown] Rudo: So I kept telling myself: “Oh...I want to go with my friend.” And then I would think “No. You must stay here.” But then again...”I want to go with my friend...” So I finally stayed with my friend, and I was lucky because I immediately found a...factory...a job at a [unintelligible] factory, three days.

00:06:29.732 --> 00:06:30.420
David Boder: Oh.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:07:15.105
[first name unknown] Rudo: Three days passed...and the soldiers arrived, and [unintelligible]. So I said “Oh...I am not lucky.” Once I find a job and I was happy...And now I have nothing. No money, no food, no idea where to go...So my friend said: “Where shall we go?” And we tried to escape two or three times, with...er...the Germans nearby...er...Amiens, and the French in Cagny, and us in Bougainville...”Oh! What shall we do?” We could hear the bombs, the machine guns...and we wanted to run away. Er...we tried to escape but we could only see fire. So when everything was calmer, we left.

00:07:15.105 --> 00:07:16.074
David Boder: Right. And where did you go?

00:07:16.074 --> 00:07:17.590
[first name unknown] Rudo: We left with a cart.

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.496
David Boder: A cart with [unintelligible].

00:07:19.496 --> 00:07:31.776
[first name unknown] Rudo: No. Not those. A baby cart, more like a pram. And well...we got lost down a path, and it was getting darker, and it was raining and all that.

00:07:31.776 --> 00:07:32.792
David Boder: You lost your friend?

00:07:32.792 --> 00:07:33.917
[first name unknown] Rudo: The two of us got lost.

00:07:33.917 --> 00:07:35.558
David Boder: And what happened?

00:07:35.558 --> 00:07:52.385
[first name unknown] Rudo: We did not realize and we ended up on a low hill. I really don’t know where they were coming from, but we could hear gun shots. So we hid in the woods and we could see nothing. I kept saying “Shut up. Don’t say a word. Don’t say a word.” And my friend was crying. And she kept saying: “Oh! They are going to kill us!”, and I would reply: “No. We have not died yet.”

00:07:52.385 --> 00:07:53.822
David Boder: [Laughing] What a story!

00:07:53.822 --> 00:08:00.682
[first name unknown] Rudo: And...then we came back to our house. Well, it was not our house. It was my friend’s employers’ house.

00:08:00.682 --> 00:08:02.025
David Boder: And where were her employers?

00:08:02.025 --> 00:08:04.666
[first name unknown] Rudo: They had escaped. They had a bike and they rushed away.

00:08:04.666 --> 00:08:05.901
David Boder: And they left the house open?

00:08:05.901 --> 00:08:08.479
[first name unknown] Rudo: They left us...and they said they would come back.

00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:09.323
David Boder: Oh.

00:08:09.323 --> 00:08:53.336
[first name unknown] Rudo: But we were sure they would not return. We thought: “They will not be able to return”. You cannot imagine what it was like...”What shall we do?” The following morning, we had no salt for the potatoes, and no food to cook...so I said “I will see if I can find someone, if I learn of a way, because we need to get out of here. This is impossible!” And I went to [unintelligible], yes, to [unintelligible] or Cagny...Yes I was in Cagny. And I saw an old family. They could barely walk. And another family with kids. So I said: “What are you doing? You have to leave.” And they said: “what shall we do with the kids?”, and an old woman said: “Oh, yes! But my legs...I cannot walk anymore. I would die on my way”...it is better than...sometimes...[unintelligible]. Then a soldier came to us and said: “You have to leave, if not...”

00:08:53.336 --> 00:08:54.461
David Boder: Was it a French soldier?

00:08:54.461 --> 00:09:22.756
[first name unknown] Rudo: Yes. And they approached both of us...Oh, they were all there...Oh, yes...What a large troop! And he said: “you both have to leave tonight...er...we are here and we will start shooting”...And he added “otherwise, you will have a bad time.” And when I heard him, I was happy and I said: “Much better. They will be closing the road...Why don’t we run away?” And the old women were crying: “where shall we go? where shall we go?” And I told my friend: “this is better, because we are leaving, right? And we will save our lives, because we don’t know what can happen. We are foreigners.”

00:09:22.756 --> 00:09:23.287
David Boder: Oh...

00:09:23.287 --> 00:09:35.583
[first name unknown] Rudo: So we left towards [unintelligible], to [unintelligible], and on our way we saw a French family...the mother was very old...and she says: “If you help me carry the [unintelligible],” [she was carrying too much stuff]...

00:09:35.583 --> 00:09:36.271
David Boder: Oh...

00:09:36.271 --> 00:09:39.708
[first name unknown] Rudo: . . . “you can put your bags.”

00:09:39.708 --> 00:09:41.551
David Boder: What did they have?

00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:43.801
[first name unknown] Rudo: They were carrying a woman...their old mother.

00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:45.332
David Boder: Yes. But, what did they have? Did they have a cart?

00:09:45.332 --> 00:09:46.425
[first name unknown] Rudo: Yes. A big cart.

00:09:46.425 --> 00:09:47.144
David Boder: Like a push-cart...

00:09:47.144 --> 00:09:47.551
[first name unknown] Rudo: Yes, a push-cart.

00:09:47.551 --> 00:09:47.988
David Boder: All right.

00:09:47.988 --> 00:09:51.394
[first name unknown] Rudo: And they were carrying many things, because it was a family of four or five, you see...

00:09:51.394 --> 00:09:51.988
David Boder: All right.

00:09:51.988 --> 00:10:10.081
[first name unknown] Rudo: And I had some tobacco...and I found some soldiers down the road...French. And we said: “If you take us far away...well...er...you...the tobacco is for you.” And they took us far away, and they were happy...And we jumped in. Oh, we were so happy! What a story, uh [laughing].

00:10:10.081 --> 00:10:12.393
David Boder: Indeed! So where did they take you?

00:10:12.393 --> 00:10:52.814
[first name unknown] Rudo: Well, we went really far away with that family. And then a bus came, and they said...er...only foreigners...may leave, you may leave right away. As you wish...And people stayed because...they were working...he was...in the train, he was the engine driver: “I will stay here because I will work. I need the money.” And we said: “No. We are going away, because we...we are not interested in staying here...they will be throwing bombs too,” and they took us to [unintelligible]. And two months later, we wanted to come to Amiens. People said “what are you going to do in Amiens”. They knew everything had been destroyed. But we said: “Oh, we have our luggage.”

00:10:52.814 --> 00:10:59.048
David Boder: Right. So, then. Where did you stay during the German occupation?

00:10:59.048 --> 00:10:59.798
[first name unknown] Rudo: Amiens.

00:10:59.798 --> 00:11:00.861
David Boder: Amiens?

00:11:00.861 --> 00:11:02.658
[first name unknown] Rudo: Amiens. We stopped...

00:11:02.658 --> 00:11:03.455
David Boder: And did you work in Amiens?

00:11:03.455 --> 00:11:16.627
[first name unknown] Rudo: Yes...I would do the laundry for a person, or sew...because I could not find a job. People here were already saying: “Red! Not red!”, you know? And we were illegal, because we...

00:11:16.627 --> 00:11:17.408
David Boder: Why did they call you red? Because...

00:11:17.408 --> 00:11:18.846
[first name unknown] Rudo: Oh! They would call us “reds” because they would associate...

00:11:18.846 --> 00:11:19.268

00:11:22.815 --> 00:11:28.924

00:11:28.924 --> 00:11:33.330

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:44.283

00:11:44.799 --> 00:11:59.642

00:12:19.375 --> 00:12:19.938

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:27.578

00:12:27.578 --> 00:12:29.485
[first name unknown] Rudo: Because they said I was a “red”.

00:12:29.485 --> 00:12:36.453

00:12:36.453 --> 00:12:38.891
[first name unknown] Rudo: I have no idea why they took me to Germany...

00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:39.329
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:39.329 --> 00:12:48.516
[first name unknown] Rudo: Well...they said I was a “red” and I would say: “why? I am in France...I have nowhere to go.” “Hush!”, they said “go get your...or we will take you.”

00:12:48.516 --> 00:12:50.329
David Boder: Yes. When did they capture you?

00:12:50.329 --> 00:12:54.813
[first name unknown] Rudo: I was usually very careful. I had my hair done, one afternoon, and when I was coming back...you see?

00:12:54.813 --> 00:12:55.313
David Boder: Pardon me.

00:12:55.313 --> 00:12:57.266
[first name unknown] Rudo: I was coming back from the hairdresser’s.

00:12:57.266 --> 00:12:58.250
David Boder: Yes. I see.

00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:59.922
[first name unknown] Rudo: I had my hair curled.

00:12:59.922 --> 00:13:00.547
David Boder: Right.

00:13:00.547 --> 00:13:04.578
[first name unknown] Rudo: And it was late. I got lost, I could not find the street...because Amiens was really destroyed.

00:13:04.578 --> 00:13:05.093
David Boder: Right.

00:13:05.093 --> 00:13:10.124
[first name unknown] Rudo: I got lost, because it was late, and dark...I did not want to return so late.

00:13:10.124 --> 00:13:10.780
David Boder: Aha.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:18.451
[first name unknown] Rudo: And the girl...Oh, God! She must have been learning, she would never finish...until she finally did...it was half past ten.

00:13:18.451 --> 00:13:23.326
David Boder: So, you were taken to Germany...And what did they make you do there? Did you work?

00:13:23.326 --> 00:13:24.201
[first name unknown] Rudo: Yes. We had to work.

00:13:24.201 --> 00:13:25.169
David Boder: Where did you work?

00:13:25.169 --> 00:13:30.059
[first name unknown] Rudo: Well...At first...with the machines...but it was really hard for me.

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:30.481
David Boder: Right.

00:13:30.481 --> 00:13:34.262
[first name unknown] Rudo: And then, when they saw I couldn’t...that I kept doing everything wrong...

00:13:34.262 --> 00:13:34.590
David Boder: Right.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:55.089
[first name unknown] Rudo: And I thought: “This people will kill me!” And I...I am...I mean...I sometimes lost my temper. And I say: “OK. I will see a doctor.” And I was scared of the doctor...but I wanted him to see I was not well, because I had spoilt everything. They wanted to take me, well...er...

00:13:55.089 --> 00:13:55.558
David Boder: Aha.

00:13:55.558 --> 00:13:58.058
[first name unknown] Rudo: To those camps...very disciplined...

00:13:58.058 --> 00:13:59.871
David Boder: Right.

00:13:59.871 --> 00:14:06.558
[first name unknown] Rudo: And I was taken to a...a camp...a job...it was in the open air. I had to exercise, of course, but it was not as tiring as the others.

00:14:06.558 --> 00:14:15.964
David Boder: Well. I think we will have to finish some other day, because I want to know what they did to you. And the man is waiting for me to leave...

00:14:15.964 --> 00:14:16.792
[first name unknown] Rudo: OK. Fine.

00:14:16.792 --> 00:14:16.528
David Boder: Thank you very much, madam.
