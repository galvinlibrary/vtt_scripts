David Boder: Munich, September the 24th, 1946, at the Deutsches Museum in Munich, the UNRRA University for Displaced Persons. The interviewee is Mr. Hilman, [corrects himself] Ilmar A., 23 years old, an Estonian, who is going to give us a half-hour report on his experiences. We are reducing it now to half-hours because the students want to have a cross-section to report.

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:53.494
David Boder: [In German] So, Mr. Ilmar.

00:01:53.494 --> 00:01:54.190
Ilmar A.: Yes.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:38.589
David Boder: Let me tell you frankly [?]: Do not tell me some general things about the political situation or the like. About this [possibly “we are informed”?]. What I want you to do in this half-hour is to narrate what happened to you and your family. You know? Not some general data or such, even if you [unintelligible]. You know? So, I want this: Would you tell me where you were and what has happened to you from the time the Soviets came to Estonia, you know?

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.857
Ilmar A.: Yes.

00:02:38.857 --> 00:03:04.510
David Boder: . . . until today. But to you personally. Where did you live, with your parents. Where did you go? What happened to you? You know? So, please speak into the direction of this here microphone. [Bend down to the microphone?], come closer. Tell me, again, where were you and what happened to you when the Soviets came to Estonia?

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:19.465
Ilmar A.: When the Soviets came to Estonia I was, was a student at the, that was in 1940.

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:23.527
David Boder: How old were you then? What grade were you in school?

00:03:23.527 --> 00:03:31.514
Ilmar A.: Then, I was seventeen years old. Then I was seventeen years old. And I was in the first grade of the “Gymnasium.”

00:03:31.514 --> 00:03:33.753
David Boder: What means “first grade”? The highest grade?

00:03:33.753 --> 00:03:38.540
Ilmar A.: “The first” means the, the fourth grade, fourth grade...

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.240
David Boder: . . . of the “Volks-”?

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.959
Ilmar A.: of the “Volks-,” uh, of the “Mittelschule.”

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.686
David Boder: Yes. The fourth grade of the “Mittelschule.” So that was after the “Pro-Gymnasium”?

00:03:45.686 --> 00:03:46.951
Ilmar A.: That was after the “Pro-Gymnasium.”

00:03:46.951 --> 00:03:49.916
David Boder: Yes. So, and in which city were you?

00:03:49.916 --> 00:03:51.914
Ilmar A.: That was in Tartu.

00:03:51.914 --> 00:03:52.647
David Boder: In Dorpat?

00:03:52.647 --> 00:03:53.398
Ilmar A.: In Dorpat.

00:03:53.398 --> 00:03:55.321
David Boder: I see, that was the famous Yuryev University.

00:03:55.321 --> 00:03:56.612
Ilmar A.: Yuryev University.

00:03:56.612 --> 00:03:59.577
David Boder: Yes. And who were your parents, Ilman?

00:03:59.577 --> 00:04:01.816
Ilmar A.: My parents were farmers.

00:04:01.816 --> 00:04:03.404
David Boder: I see, and where did they live?

00:04:03.404 --> 00:04:05.978
Ilmar A.: They lived in [place name; sounds like “Tartaulag”?], in the municipality of [name unintelligible; sounds like “Saparau” or “Saparai”?].

00:04:05.978 --> 00:04:06.246
David Boder: I see.

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:07.369
Ilmar A.: In [unintelligible; possibly the name of the larger administrative unit, such as county, district, or region].

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:14.630
David Boder: So, tell me what happened in the university when the Soviets came, and what happened at your home.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:05:08.622
Ilmar A.: When the Soviets came to us I was not a [university] student, but a [high school] student. I was in Tartu in the, everybody was at home the first morning. But my father also had a factory and an, a farm, about thirty-five hectare. But until May 1941 nothing special happened. It wasn’t until June 14, 1941 that several of my relatives were deported to Siberia. That’s because, they were also Democrats. And...

00:05:08.622 --> 00:05:09.697
David Boder: What was that?

00:05:09.697 --> 00:05:12.555
Ilmar A.: They had democratic opinion.

00:05:12.555 --> 00:05:15.287
David Boder: Yes, but what do you mean by they had “democratic opinion”?

00:05:15.287 --> 00:05:21.381
Ilmar A.: That they used to be, uh, members of the [name of the organization unintelligible].

00:05:21.381 --> 00:05:26.106
David Boder: I see, and? Continue.

00:05:26.106 --> 00:05:36.550
Ilmar A.: And on the 19th, [corrects himself] in 1941, on the 14th of June...

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:37.847
David Boder: [unintelligible correction; possibly “June day”?].

00:05:37.847 --> 00:05:49.942
Ilmar A.: Yes, on the 14th June-day [unintelligible] we got word that the deported could, we were in the forest.

00:05:49.942 --> 00:05:51.286
David Boder: Who was in the forest?

00:05:51.286 --> 00:05:53.967
Ilmar A.: My parents and I.

00:05:53.967 --> 00:05:55.311
David Boder: Now, go on.

00:05:55.311 --> 00:05:56.695
Ilmar A.: And...

00:05:56.695 --> 00:05:59.946
David Boder: So, you were in the forest. How did you live in the forest?

00:05:59.946 --> 00:06:08.267
Ilmar A.: We were in the forest. We, we hid in the forest.

00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:10.249
David Boder: Well, did you have a house there?

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:13.460
Ilmar A.: No, we didn’t have a house, but we had a...

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.089
David Boder: Tent?

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:21.684
Ilmar A.: Tent, or something like it. And we are hidden. And...

00:06:21.684 --> 00:06:23.622
David Boder: Who was there together, in this hide-out?

00:06:23.622 --> 00:06:26.230
Ilmar A.: My parents. My parents, my sister [he possibly means “siblings”?], and I.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.535
David Boder: Yes. How many, uh, how many people are there in your family?

00:06:29.535 --> 00:06:30.385
Ilmar A.: Seven people.

00:06:30.385 --> 00:06:33.697
David Boder: I see. And the entire family hid in the forest.

00:06:33.697 --> 00:06:34.071
Ilmar A.: Yes.

00:06:34.071 --> 00:06:36.980
David Boder: Now, how long did you hide in the forest?

00:06:36.980 --> 00:07:34.438
Ilmar A.: We were in the forest only, uh, four, four weeks. Then, on the June 21, 1941 is, uh, we started in the direction of Germany, and...And that was in July. The Germans already came to us. And then we could return out of the forest. Then in 1941, in the fall we visited my brother Walter on the, that was in the year of 1942, [unintelligible].

00:07:34.438 --> 00:07:35.977
David Boder: Tell that again.

00:07:35.977 --> 00:07:36.882
Ilmar A.: What?

00:07:36.882 --> 00:07:42.605
David Boder: Go on. Did the, did the Germans interfere in any way with the school?

00:07:42.605 --> 00:08:16.516
Ilmar A.: Yes. The Germans did interfere with the school in a [unintelligible] way. Because they, they could not have our organization and the like. Previously, we had a [unintelligible]-organization, which in the, that, for our house-organization. And when/if [unclear which is meant] they knew that they come to us we could lock [he possibly means “close down”?] the organization. And I, too, was a member.

00:08:16.516 --> 00:08:17.934
David Boder: And that was “locked”?

00:08:17.934 --> 00:08:18.967
Ilmar A.: That was locked.

00:08:18.967 --> 00:08:21.894
David Boder: Well, and then? When the Germans came?

00:08:21.894 --> 00:08:38.234
Ilmar A.: When the Germans came we could no longer open that [organization]. And, that was in the year of 1942, I went to the university then, to Dorpat University.

00:08:38.234 --> 00:08:46.411
David Boder: Now. Will you tell me: when the Russians came, did you think that Estonia will become Soviet?

00:08:46.411 --> 00:08:49.734
Ilmar A.: Yes. They said that Estonia will become Soviet Union.

00:08:49.734 --> 00:08:51.372
David Boder: And goes over to Russia?

00:08:51.372 --> 00:08:56.028
Ilmar A.: Yes. That, officially they did not say that.

00:08:56.028 --> 00:08:56.409
David Boder: I see.

00:08:56.409 --> 00:08:58.871
Ilmar A.: But it appeared that way.

00:08:58.871 --> 00:09:02.634
David Boder: Well. But officially they said that Estonia would remain alone [he means “independent”]?

00:09:02.634 --> 00:09:13.174
Ilmar A.: No, they did not say because we had no inter—, inter—, no administration. Instead we all of a sudden had, uh, Soviet administration.

00:09:13.174 --> 00:09:20.032
David Boder: Yes. Well. When the Germans go [Boder probably means “came”]. Did the Germans say that Estonia will be free?

00:09:20.032 --> 00:09:22.146
Ilmar A.: No, the Germans did not say that either.

00:09:22.146 --> 00:09:23.747
David Boder: What did they say?

00:09:23.747 --> 00:09:32.352
Ilmar A.: This they did not say. They had occupation troops. And we should be Germans as [unintelligible]-occupied, too.

00:09:32.352 --> 00:09:38.521
David Boder: Oh, I see. The Germans, did the Germans say that they would take Estonia to Germany?

00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:50.113
Ilmar A.: Uh, for the time being they did not say, but it was an occupied territory. And they wanted us, uh, to extinguish everything of us.

00:09:50.113 --> 00:10:02.503
David Boder: I see. So neither the Germans nor the Russians incorporated Estonia? The Russians did not turn Estonia into a Soviet Republic, did they?

00:10:02.503 --> 00:10:05.614
Ilmar A.: Yes, they made Soviet, Estonia Soviet Republic.

00:10:05.614 --> 00:10:06.838
David Boder: Estonia became a Soviet Republic?

00:10:06.838 --> 00:10:07.670
Ilmar A.: Yes.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:12.814
David Boder: And when the Germans came, did the Germans say that they will take Estonia, or what?

00:10:12.814 --> 00:10:16.870
Ilmar A.: No, they did not, instead it was an occupied territory.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:23.453
David Boder: Yes. Now, you were in an occupation, [corrects himself] occupied territory. And you had to do certain labor for the Germans?

00:10:23.453 --> 00:10:25.329
Ilmar A.: For the Germans, yes.

00:10:25.329 --> 00:10:33.891
David Boder: Did the, the Germans arrest, uh, execute, and so forth certain people, or did they deport them, as the Russians had done?

00:10:33.891 --> 00:10:44.275
Ilmar A.: Yes. The Germans did that, too, to a greater extent. Because in 1942 I was at the Dorpat University and, back then, I was very...

00:10:44.275 --> 00:10:45.726
David Boder: Yes.

00:10:45.726 --> 00:11:19.147
Ilmar A.: The, the, the Germans did, uh, persecute our professors and our students. And SB-people [unclear what he means by SB], you know, police always and always followed/persecuted [unclear which meaning of the German word “verfolgen” is intended] me. And, uh, that was in 1943. In [unintelligible] very many, almost fifty percent, uh, [unintelligible] of our professors and also some of the students were arrested.

00:11:19.147 --> 00:11:21.993
David Boder: I see. And what did they do with them?

00:11:21.993 --> 00:11:28.601
Ilmar A.: They, they, brought them, uh, into prison.

00:11:28.601 --> 00:11:30.606
David Boder: And, were you arrested, too?

00:11:30.606 --> 00:11:37.653
Ilmar A.: No, I mean and, therefore, these were our students and that, that one organization or a...

00:11:37.653 --> 00:11:38.322
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:38.322 --> 00:11:39.563
Ilmar A.: . . . communal family.

00:11:39.563 --> 00:11:42.084
David Boder: Were you taken as well? You personally?

00:11:42.084 --> 00:11:47.966
Ilmar A.: I personally was not taken. But I knew that they wanted to.

00:11:47.966 --> 00:12:00.151
David Boder: Well? And then, tell me, uh, what happened then?

00:12:00.151 --> 00:12:17.174
Ilmar A.: That was ’42. Uh, then I went to the countryside to my parents and we had a farm in the countryside. The factory we no longer had and the Russians had [unintelligible; some participle ending in “-tiert”] the factory.

00:12:17.174 --> 00:12:18.473
David Boder: What kind of factory was that?

00:12:18.473 --> 00:12:19.982
Ilmar A.: That was baking-factory.

00:12:19.982 --> 00:12:22.045
David Boder: Now, did the Germans return the factory?

00:12:22.045 --> 00:12:38.017
Ilmar A.: No. The Germans did not return that either but they [verb unintelligible] everything, uh, all things, all machinery.

00:12:38.017 --> 00:12:39.831
David Boder: [verb; unintelligible]?

00:12:39.831 --> 00:12:44.149
Ilmar A.: Yes.

00:12:44.149 --> 00:12:54.309
David Boder: Well, continue. Were you trying to say that the Germans took away your machinery, or did they have the machines work for the Germans, so to say?

00:12:54.309 --> 00:13:05.290
Ilmar A.: At first, they let them work for the Germans and at last, when they did not come [he probably means “get,” which is similar in German; “kommen” and “bekommen”] anything anymore, then they brought the machines back...

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:05.748
David Boder: . . . evacuated?

00:13:05.748 --> 00:13:08.670
Ilmar A.: . . . evacuated them to Germany.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:11.554
David Boder: Yes. And you were at the university?

00:13:11.554 --> 00:13:15.049
Ilmar A.: Uh, I was, during winter I was at the university.

00:13:15.049 --> 00:13:19.326
David Boder: Yes. And what happened to you next? To you and your family?

00:13:19.326 --> 00:13:43.335
Ilmar A.: Then, uh, I was, in summer, I was in the countryside. And in the fall I returned to Tartu. And I was able to study until 1944, February.

00:13:43.335 --> 00:13:44.808
David Boder: And then?

00:13:44.808 --> 00:13:53.133
Ilmar A.: Then I wanted [or: “should”] to go to the countryside again, because they, otherwise, I, again [nearer and nearer?] came [unintelligible, possibly “nearer and nearer”]...

00:13:53.133 --> 00:13:53.773
David Boder: [unintelligible, Boder suggests some verb]?

00:13:53.773 --> 00:14:16.365
Ilmar A.: Yes, [repeats what Boder said]. And our university should lock its door. [unintelligible], I was in the countryside what [he means “when”] the Germans again made an arrest, our professors and of the, also a group of students.

00:14:16.365 --> 00:14:20.184
David Boder: And what did they say as to why they arrested them?

00:14:20.184 --> 00:14:37.472
Ilmar A.: They arrested them because they had doubts [he means “suspicions”] about us, that we were having connections to Finland and Sweden. And we were indeed helping, and this is the truth, that we were helping people flee to Finland and Sweden.

00:14:37.472 --> 00:14:42.939
David Boder: I see. But Finland was fighting with the Germans, Finland was on the side of the Germans?

00:14:42.939 --> 00:14:53.136
Ilmar A.: Yes. Finland was on the German side, it was supposed to be on the German side. That’s why the Russians wanted to occupy Finland.

00:14:53.136 --> 00:14:57.129
David Boder: But why, then, were the Germans afraid of you going to Finland?

00:14:57.129 --> 00:15:23.410
Ilmar A.: They did not want to send us to Finland because we, the people that wanted to flee to Finland said [unintelligible], they were neither “directed” [he perhaps means something like “politically oriented”] as Communists nor directed as Nazists [sic] or Fascists. They were, uh, so...

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:24.205
David Boder: Impartial?

00:15:24.205 --> 00:15:26.415
Ilmar A.: Impartial, free Democrats.

00:15:26.415 --> 00:15:30.874
David Boder: And, go on.

00:15:30.874 --> 00:15:50.680
Ilmar A.: A few of us then fled to Finland and Sweden. Now, we are having 35,000 people in Sweden, we have them there as underground people and mostly intelligent.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:56.302
David Boder: And, how do they live there in Sweden? Do they live the same as here, like the, the...

00:15:56.302 --> 00:16:25.298
Ilmar A.: They, they do not live in Sweden like the [unintelligible], but they have to work. And they have already learned the Swedish language. And are working somewhere in the trades and are having very simple work. But, such, specialized work they were not able to secure because they are professors, or the intelligence and they could not get adequate work but have to...

00:16:25.298 --> 00:16:26.015
David Boder: . . . work physically?

00:16:26.015 --> 00:16:28.264
Ilmar A.: Make, perform physical labor.

00:16:28.264 --> 00:16:31.673
David Boder: And the UNRRA is helping there, or, uh...?

00:16:31.673 --> 00:16:38.903
Ilmar A.: Of that I have no clue. But I believe the UNRRA is not there but...

00:16:38.903 --> 00:16:39.709
David Boder: They are simply there...

00:16:39.709 --> 00:16:40.094
Ilmar A.: . . . simply...

00:16:40.094 --> 00:16:41.578
David Boder: . . . like migrants, like emigrants?

00:16:41.578 --> 00:16:43.380
Ilmar A.: . . . like emigrants, like emigrants there.

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:46.154
David Boder: Now, continue, what happened to you?

00:16:46.154 --> 00:17:02.912
Ilmar A.: Here I could, [unintelligible] from, until September 1944. Then I should come away from my house, should leave my house.

00:17:02.912 --> 00:17:03.960
David Boder: Why?

00:17:03.960 --> 00:18:00.722
Ilmar A.: That was because the front came closer and closer, and I wanted to flee to Sweden. But my parents stayed behind. And they could not come with me because they were, uh, old. Health was no longer good. That was September 20, 1944; I wanted to go away to Sweden from [some place name; sounds like “Atrau”?]. We had a boat and wanted to flee to Sweden over the Sea. We had been on our way already for a day or so, but at night we had an accident and the Germans caught us.

00:18:00.722 --> 00:18:01.845
David Boder: Where was that?

00:18:01.845 --> 00:18:03.543
Ilmar A.: That was on the sea.

00:18:03.543 --> 00:18:05.999
David Boder: And what, you, you went by boat?

00:18:05.999 --> 00:18:06.892
Ilmar A.: Yes, by boat.

00:18:06.892 --> 00:18:08.098
David Boder: What kind of boat?

00:18:08.098 --> 00:18:11.209
Ilmar A.: That was simply a small, small boat.

00:18:11.209 --> 00:18:12.098
David Boder: Motor boat?

00:18:12.098 --> 00:18:14.769
Ilmar A.: No, [inaudible]. Yes, it was a motor boat.

00:18:14.769 --> 00:18:16.551
David Boder: And where did you want to cross over?

00:18:16.551 --> 00:18:18.015
Ilmar A.: We wanted to cross over to Sweden.

00:18:18.015 --> 00:18:21.305
David Boder: Was it possible to drive over to Sweden in such a boat?

00:18:21.305 --> 00:18:22.908
Ilmar A.: No, you were not allowed to cross over.

00:18:22.908 --> 00:18:26.829
David Boder: Yes, but I mean, can such a boat drive over to Sweden?

00:18:26.829 --> 00:18:34.940
Ilmar A.: Yes, we thought that we could drive over. It was, uh, the last option.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.920
David Boder: How many people were in the boat?

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.321
Ilmar A.: There were six people in the boat.

00:18:39.321 --> 00:18:40.908
David Boder: I see, and it had an engine?

00:18:40.908 --> 00:18:41.491
Ilmar A.: Yes.

00:18:41.491 --> 00:18:44.959
David Boder: And did you have enough gasoline to cross over?

00:18:44.959 --> 00:18:52.797
Ilmar A.: Yes, we did not have so much gasoline, but we also had, uh, oars.

00:18:52.797 --> 00:18:53.666
David Boder: I see.

00:18:53.666 --> 00:18:58.817
Ilmar A.: Yes, and at last we maybe would have, uh, rowed.

00:18:58.817 --> 00:19:02.698
David Boder: And where did the Germans catch you?

00:19:02.698 --> 00:19:09.575
Ilmar A.: The Germans caught us about halfway across the Sea.

00:19:09.575 --> 00:19:11.952
David Boder: How many days had you been away from, from shore?

00:19:11.952 --> 00:19:14.111
Ilmar A.: I was about a day.

00:19:14.111 --> 00:19:16.468
David Boder: I see. Well, [disbelieving] that was not halfway across, I mean, one cannot...

00:19:16.468 --> 00:19:19.635
Ilmar A.: [unintelligible] one day, and in two days you are already across.

00:19:19.635 --> 00:19:20.246
David Boder: [surprised] To Sweden?

00:19:20.246 --> 00:19:21.810
Ilmar A.: Yes, to Sweden.

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:24.147
David Boder: Ok, continue.

00:19:24.147 --> 00:19:32.913
Ilmar A.: And they brought us to Germany.

00:19:32.913 --> 00:19:34.890
David Boder: And what happened then?

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:58.910
Ilmar A.: That was in the lager and I am the son of a farmer. Then I said that I can do field work somewhere. Because then I believed that possibly that was the best way to stay alive. Because the food was very bad.

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:01.089
David Boder: In which lager were you?

00:20:01.089 --> 00:20:03.129
Ilmar A.: That was in [Gotenhafen?].

00:20:03.129 --> 00:20:07.907
David Boder: [unintelligible]. How many people were there in this lager in general? Was that a big concentration camp?

00:20:07.907 --> 00:20:19.054
Ilmar A.: That is, that was not a concentration camp, but it was a “Durchgangslager” [transit camp] or some such, and the number of people I cannot tell.

00:20:19.054 --> 00:20:22.205
David Boder: Roughly, how many would you estimate?

00:20:22.205 --> 00:20:23.729
Ilmar A.: There were a thousand there.

00:20:23.729 --> 00:20:24.320
David Boder: A thousand.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:24.832
Ilmar A.: Yes.

00:20:24.832 --> 00:20:31.158
David Boder: And how, how did the Germans behave toward you personally?

00:20:31.158 --> 00:20:50.012
Ilmar A.: At first they were [unintelligible]. But in the end they said, “yes, you can go to work there and you can go away then, they/you [same word in German] were there only three days.” I told that I was the son of a farmer and that I can do field work.

00:20:50.012 --> 00:20:51.278
David Boder: You were in the camp only three days?

00:20:51.278 --> 00:20:51.810
Ilmar A.: Yes, yes.

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:53.612
David Boder: Well, go on.

00:20:53.612 --> 00:20:56.326
Ilmar A.: Then I went to...

00:20:56.326 --> 00:21:00.072
David Boder: Did the Germans beat you at any time?

00:21:00.072 --> 00:21:03.148
Ilmar A.: No, I personally was never beaten.

00:21:03.148 --> 00:21:06.319
David Boder: Why not? Did they beat anybody else?

00:21:06.319 --> 00:21:09.609
Ilmar A.: I saw that, but me, they never, no.

00:21:09.609 --> 00:21:13.811
David Boder: And who were the people whom they did beat?

00:21:13.811 --> 00:21:28.143
Ilmar A.: This I cannot say. I do not know what nationality or what they have, they were, uh, of many nationalities, Lets, Lithuanians, Poles, all sorts of people.

00:21:28.143 --> 00:21:31.274
David Boder: Well, go on. Did you go to the countryside?

00:21:31.274 --> 00:21:42.123
Ilmar A.: And I was in the countryside and I worked there until, uh, May 5, 1945.

00:21:42.123 --> 00:21:49.659
David Boder: What happened then? (One moment.) [Boder as if talking to someone in the background]. How did the farmer behave toward you? Did he give you enough to eat?

00:21:49.659 --> 00:21:56.044
Ilmar A.: Enough food he did not give, but I ate separately.

00:21:56.044 --> 00:21:56.926
David Boder: What does that mean, you “ate separately”?

00:21:56.926 --> 00:22:10.073
Ilmar A.: Ate extra in, in a room and the farmer ate in the dining room.

00:22:10.073 --> 00:22:16.875
David Boder: And what did they [no verb] you, [corrects himself] and did they pay you anything?

00:22:16.875 --> 00:22:21.256
Ilmar A.: There they paid us twenty-three marks per month.

00:22:21.256 --> 00:22:24.089
David Boder: And who was with you?

00:22:24.089 --> 00:22:25.133
Ilmar A.: I beg your pardon?

00:22:25.133 --> 00:22:28.284
David Boder: You say “us,” who was there with you?

00:22:28.284 --> 00:22:31.018
Ilmar A.: Well, I meant that, uh,...

00:22:31.018 --> 00:22:31.689
David Boder: . . . in general?

00:22:31.689 --> 00:22:33.352
Ilmar A.: . . . in general, [unintelligible].

00:22:33.352 --> 00:22:38.765
David Boder: Twenty-three marks per month. And what was there to buy with twenty-three marks?

00:22:38.765 --> 00:22:42.908
Ilmar A.: For the money, you could not buy anything.

00:22:42.908 --> 00:22:44.745
David Boder: Did you have a ration card?

00:22:44.745 --> 00:22:49.324
Ilmar A.: No, I did not have. Instead, the farmer gave me. Gave food.

00:22:49.324 --> 00:22:58.070
David Boder: Gave food. How did the farmer, how did the farmer behave? Was he decent? Was he friendly?

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:13.602
Ilmar A.: At first, he was not friendly. But in the end I worked well, because I am a young man after all, and the farmer was quite decent.

00:23:13.602 --> 00:23:19.626
David Boder: Well. And what happened on May 5, that’s what you said, right, March 5 [sic], what happened then? What was that?

00:23:19.626 --> 00:23:31.448
Ilmar A.: Then the American occupation troops arrived and we were freed from the Germans, and we could be supplied for by the Americans.

00:23:31.448 --> 00:23:33.012
David Boder: Where was that? Was that in...?

00:23:33.012 --> 00:23:34.870
Ilmar A.: That was in Oberlungwitz, that was...

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:36.592
David Boder: Is that in the American Zone?

00:23:36.592 --> 00:23:42.104
Ilmar A.: No, this is not in the American Zone now, it is now the Russian Zone.

00:23:42.104 --> 00:23:43.195
David Boder: It is the Russian Zone?

00:23:43.195 --> 00:23:43.945
Ilmar A.: Yes.

00:23:43.945 --> 00:23:48.505
David Boder: And, did you get from that zone to here, to Munich?

00:23:48.505 --> 00:23:54.473
Ilmar A.: I flee—, I fled from that zone again.

00:23:54.473 --> 00:23:55.342
David Boder: Why?

00:23:55.342 --> 00:24:11.886
Ilmar A.: That is because I heard that the Russians would be coming there. And I was afraid already because I flee already from the Russians in 1944 and I know what that means; that was...

00:24:11.886 --> 00:24:15.945
David Boder: [interrupts] In ’44 you were not fleeing from the Russians, were you? ’44 you were fleeing from the Germans, right?

00:24:15.945 --> 00:24:17.846
Ilmar A.: From the Germans and here as well from the Russians.

00:24:17.846 --> 00:24:17.846
David Boder: Oh, that the Russians are coming, yes.

00:24:17.846 --> 00:24:37.015
Ilmar A.: The Russians were coming and I know what it means, a Russian occupation because, that, uh, in 1941, on the 14th July one was, were deported sixty thousand men and women to Siberia. Sixty thousand of us.

00:24:37.015 --> 00:24:37.606
David Boder: Sixteen?

00:24:37.606 --> 00:24:38.495
Ilmar A.: Sixty.

00:24:38.495 --> 00:24:39.047
David Boder: Sixty-thousand.

00:24:39.047 --> 00:24:48.583
Ilmar A.: Yes. That means, uh, one, uh, seven percent...

00:24:48.583 --> 00:24:49.460
David Boder: Yes, of the whole.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.662
Ilmar A.: of the whole population.

00:24:51.662 --> 00:25:04.254
David Boder: Well? [short break in the recording] What happened there?

00:25:04.254 --> 00:25:24.012
Ilmar A.: Here I lived and I wanted to go on with my studies and I asked to be given the chance to continue studying somewhere in Germany. Now I have heard that...

00:25:24.012 --> 00:25:24.504
David Boder: Yes?

00:25:24.504 --> 00:25:35.171
Ilmar A.: . . . I heard that here in Munich is, founds a UNRRA University, that is an international university where there are studying nineteen, twelve...

00:25:35.171 --> 00:25:37.449
David Boder: I see. What are you studying here?

00:25:37.449 --> 00:25:39.092
Ilmar A.: I am studying “Bauwesen” [Building or construction].

00:25:39.092 --> 00:25:40.021
David Boder: What? “Bauwesen”?

00:25:40.021 --> 00:25:40.513
Ilmar A.: “Bauwesen.”

00:25:40.513 --> 00:25:40.926
David Boder: Architecture?

00:25:40.926 --> 00:25:44.871
Ilmar A.: Archi—, no, not archi—, but subject area “Bauwesen.”

00:25:44.871 --> 00:25:46.752
David Boder: Well, building houses?

00:25:46.752 --> 00:25:48.812
Ilmar A.: Houses, “Tief- und Hochbau.”

00:25:48.812 --> 00:25:50.473
David Boder: What means “Tiefbau”?

00:25:50.473 --> 00:25:56.313
Ilmar A.: That, also hydraulic engineering, uh, and canals, channels, and [unintelligible] and so forth.

00:25:56.313 --> 00:26:00.138
David Boder: I see, and how long is that going to take?

00:26:00.138 --> 00:26:06.274
Ilmar A.: Here in Germany it will take three years. We have tri-semesters, we have three semesters a year.

00:26:06.274 --> 00:26:09.211
David Boder: Yes. And what is the language of instruction?

00:26:09.211 --> 00:26:12.074
Ilmar A.: Instruction is in the German language.

00:26:12.074 --> 00:26:19.523
David Boder: Now, tell me. Where do you think of going from here? Are you hearing word from your parents? What happened with your parents?

00:26:19.523 --> 00:26:33.760
Ilmar A.: I have not heard from my parents, that is because we have no connection. In my opinion, my parents have already been deported to Siberia. That is probable.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.486
David Boder: And what are the people doing when they are deported to Siberia?

00:26:37.486 --> 00:26:42.087
Ilmar A.: They are, uh, skilled laborers.

00:26:42.087 --> 00:26:50.257
David Boder: Now, tell me, how and, uh...

00:26:50.257 --> 00:26:55.999
Ilmar A.: . . . have an uncle in America, but I know no address, I know no address.

00:26:55.999 --> 00:27:05.840
David Boder: Now, Mr. Ilman, there are so many more things I want to hear from you, but I have resolved that I from all half an hour, that I talk with everyone for half an hour. We have been together now for half an hour.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:06.525
Ilmar A.: Yes.

00:27:06.525 --> 00:27:10.473
David Boder: Well, will you please send in the next gentleman?

00:27:10.473 --> 00:27:23.810
