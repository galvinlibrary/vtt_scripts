00:00:00.555 --> 00:00:17.055
David Boder: [In English] Paris, July 30th. July 30th, 1946. I am interviewing now a gentleman, a Polish refugee, Mr. Boleslaw Czolopicki.

00:00:17.055 --> 00:00:22.142
David Boder: [In Russian] No family, forty-three years old.

00:00:22.142 --> 00:00:30.487
David Boder: [In English] Alright, er, you understand English?

00:00:30.487 --> 00:00:33.269
Boleslaw Czolopicki: Yes. I understand a little.

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:52.813
David Boder: [In English] Now, I will ask you in English, and you please answer in Polish. Understand? You can answer in Polish, because we want to have it in the language you can best speak. You understand? Where were you born, Mr. Czolopicki?

00:00:52.813 --> 00:00:53.828
Boleslaw Czolopicki: In Poland?

00:00:53.828 --> 00:00:55.003
David Boder: Yes.

00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:56.809
Boleslaw Czolopicki: I must speak...in Poland?

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.510
David Boder: No, no, you speak Polish. Where were you born?

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.106
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] I was born in Warsaw.

00:01:02.106 --> 00:01:06.974
David Boder: [In Russian] In Warsaw? Do you have a wife, children?

00:01:06.974 --> 00:01:08.474
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] No. No.

00:01:08.474 --> 00:01:10.537
David Boder: [In Russian] Do you understand my Russian?

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:11.903
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] I understand.

00:01:11.903 --> 00:01:23.864
David Boder: [In Russian] I will speak in Russian, and you will answer in Polish. When did you leave Russia? Poland?

00:01:23.864 --> 00:01:30.072
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] It was after the Warsaw Uprising in ’44.

00:01:30.072 --> 00:01:34.860
David Boder: [In Russian] Oh, in ’43. And where did you go?

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.860
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] I was deported by the Germans.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:39.990
David Boder: [In Russian] In ’43?

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.135
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] Not in ’43. In ’44.

00:01:44.135 --> 00:01:50.636
David Boder: [In Russian] Oh, you left Warsaw in ’44? Why did you leave Warsaw?

00:01:50.636 --> 00:01:55.798
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] Well, the Germans were deporting everybody out of Warsaw.

00:01:55.798 --> 00:01:58.485
David Boder: [In Russian] And where did they deport you?

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:00.854
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] They deported us to the Rhineland.

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:24.516
David Boder: [In Russian] Well...Now I want you to tell me everything that happened to you from the moment when the Nazis had taken Warsaw to the moment when you had been liberated in Paris. Tell me...And don’t skip anything, tell me all the details.

00:02:24.516 --> 00:02:58.503
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] The moment that on the 5th of October 1944 the Germans deported...the entire population of Warsaw...er...to Germany. It’s a bit hard for me...

00:02:58.503 --> 00:02:59.636
David Boder: To speak in Polish?

00:02:59.636 --> 00:03:02.989
Boleslaw Czolopicki: No. Just what form to take...

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:12.661
David Boder: [In Russian] Speak freely. Speak as if you were chatting with somebody else. That’s all.

00:03:12.661 --> 00:04:13.336
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] So...we were sent, I mean we were given the opportunity...to pack our things, just what we could put on ourselves...to walk on foot to Ursus, a place a few kilometers out of Warsaw. There, we were kept for about two days, and then in freight trains...er...under German...escort. They transported us for almost five days and nights into the heart of Germany, to the Rhineland.

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:17.286
David Boder: [In English] And then?

00:04:17.286 --> 00:08:36.797
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish]...Of course the people were very mixed—meaning women, children, men, everybody together. The conditions were dreadful because, for example, in the freight cars there were no...suitable facilities...they sometimes stopped so that one could go to the toilet. All of this, of course, under supervision by the guards, men and women together, nothing else was possible...And the food was also very poor, we ate just once a day...When we found ourselves in [Wanne?] near Bochum we arrived at the precise moment that Bochum was being bombarded by...the English. The result of this air-strike was that five of our wagons were burned, several people burned too, killed...The rest of us were transported to a camp, to a distributing camp...near Essen. There, of course, we were also kept under very primitive conditions. [Unintelligible] in the floor, crowded conditions, one person on top of another, no bedding. There we were kept...a month, or two months, I think. Then, we were taken to various factories, or else placed on a list for farm work. I found myself...in Geldern-Kapellen...I was employed at a camp which...deportees worked there, digging trenches...There, I spent...remained, until...liberation by the Americans. March 3, 1945 we were liberated by the Americans...So at that time German deportations ceased. Am I to go on to talk of further...

00:08:36.797 --> 00:08:42.781
David Boder: [In Russian] Yes, yes.

00:08:42.781 --> 00:09:32.848
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish]...Then with the Americans...I signed up to work for the Americans and came to France with the Americans. For a while, I worked with Americans in France. Then I resigned, came to Paris where I began further studies at the school of design.

00:09:32.848 --> 00:09:55.022
David Boder: [In Russian] Tell me the following. Did you work [or] did they keep you in “concentration camps”? Konzentrationslager?

00:09:55.022 --> 00:10:06.828
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] No, it wasn’t really a concentration camp, but a camp for those deported specifically to work.

00:10:06.828 --> 00:10:13.010
David Boder: [In Russian] Aha, you were working. How was the food?

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:20.596
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] The food was, of course...rutabaga, it was [background noise; unintelligible]. Food.

00:10:20.596 --> 00:10:27.994
David Boder: [In Russian] Aha, and who were your supervisors: Germans or Poles?

00:10:27.994 --> 00:10:50.486
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] No. Germans, of course. Those who served in those yellow uniforms. It was their—I can’t remember what it was called—members of the German People’s Party.

00:10:50.486 --> 00:10:53.315
David Boder: [In Russian] Aha, aha.

00:10:53.315 --> 00:10:56.087
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] In yellow uniforms with those armbands

00:10:56.087 --> 00:10:59.905
David Boder: [In Russian] Aha, aha, SS swastikas.

00:10:59.905 --> 00:11:06.463
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] It probably was [background noise; unintelligible]...which will go on for a while.

00:11:06.463 --> 00:11:10.864
David Boder: [In Russian] And where did the Americans liberate you? In which town?

00:11:10.864 --> 00:11:12.476
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] [Inaudible] Moers.

00:11:12.476 --> 00:11:14.870
David Boder: [In Russian] Moers...over the Rhine?

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:15.463
Boleslaw Czolopicki: Yes.

00:11:15.463 --> 00:11:22.484
David Boder: Aha. Do you plan to return to Poland?

00:11:22.484 --> 00:11:32.631
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] At present I plan to finish my studies here [inaudible]. Which will still take a while.

00:11:32.631 --> 00:11:35.700
David Boder: [In Russian] And what are you studying now?

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.522
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] At the moment I’m learning the radio.

00:11:38.522 --> 00:11:46.798
David Boder: [In Russian] The radio. Are you paying to study at this school?

00:11:46.798 --> 00:11:50.276
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] Up to now, I’m paying at that school.

00:11:50.276 --> 00:11:51.825
David Boder: [In Russian] You’re paying?

00:11:51.825 --> 00:11:59.340
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] But here, I’m to be paid for. In this school...

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:04.433
David Boder: [In Russian] And your school, is it a day school? Do you have some job in Paris?

00:12:04.433 --> 00:12:17.326
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] No. I mean, so far, I worked, but now, because I signed up for that course, I’ve stopped working. And here that course will be paid for.

00:12:17.326 --> 00:12:23.341
David Boder: [In Russian] Aha, and where in Paris do you live?

00:12:23.341 --> 00:12:26.733
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] At Le Bonoir [?]

00:12:26.733 --> 00:12:35.133
David Boder: [In Russian] Do you pay for your lodgings, or is it communal living for many Poles?

00:12:35.133 --> 00:12:38.287
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] No, I live in a hotel.

00:12:38.287 --> 00:12:48.370
David Boder: [In Russian] Have you any relatives in America? Any members of your family in the U.S.?

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.900
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] No. I have no relatives in America.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:57.936
David Boder: [In Russian] You have no relatives in America. And what do you plan to do: will you stay in France, or something else?

00:12:57.936 --> 00:13:03.044
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] I would most like to emigrate.

00:13:03.044 --> 00:13:04.399
David Boder: [In Russian] Where to?

00:13:04.399 --> 00:13:06.287
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] Let’s say precisely to America.

00:13:06.287 --> 00:13:06.820
David Boder: [In Russian] To America?

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:15.785
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] If it were possible.

00:13:15.785 --> 00:13:27.679
David Boder: [In Russian] Tell me something. When you lived in Warsaw up to ’44, were you there during the destruction of the Jewish ghetto?

00:13:27.679 --> 00:13:39.912
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] Yes. I was. I was there the whole time up to ’44. I was in Warsaw during the entire period of the war. Of course, I also had to keep hiding from the Germans.

00:13:39.912 --> 00:13:42.418
David Boder: [In Russian] Aha.

00:13:42.418 --> 00:14:18.611
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] Even...under an assumed name. At the time of that Pogrom...I was in Warsaw. And...I kept observing and seeing, of course, the battle of the ghetto.

00:14:18.611 --> 00:14:31.305
David Boder: [In Russian] And you think that having no relatives in America, it would be possible for you to travel there? Would you like to go to South America?

00:14:31.305 --> 00:14:32.430
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] Brazil.

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:38.375
David Boder: [In Russian] Brazil. Do you speak French well?

00:14:38.375 --> 00:14:42.090
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] A bit. I understand it, I mean.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:42.959
David Boder: [In Russian] Aha.

00:14:42.959 --> 00:14:44.169
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] I can read it...

00:14:44.169 --> 00:14:45.455
David Boder: [In Russian] You can read it?

00:14:45.455 --> 00:14:46.352
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] I write it quite well...

00:14:46.352 --> 00:14:47.685
David Boder: [In Russian] Aha.

00:14:47.685 --> 00:15:01.192
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] It’s just that speaking...when it comes to speaking it still presents certain problems...[background noise; unintelligible]...very quickly

00:15:01.192 --> 00:15:38.121
David Boder: [In Russian] Thank you, Mr. Czolopicki. I was very interesting to talk to you. I would like to propose one small experiment...I have some pictures. What do you think this picture represents?

00:15:38.121 --> 00:15:41.363
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] It’s a photograph of a woman [background noise; unintelligible]

00:15:41.363 --> 00:16:04.596
David Boder: [In Russian] Speak up. Well, and what does it represent?

00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:13.245
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish]...a boy, lost in thought, sitting on [unintelligible]

00:16:13.245 --> 00:16:21.478
David Boder: [In Russian] Good. What does this picture represent?

00:16:21.478 --> 00:16:39.611
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish]...[long pause] And this represents...a sick person, dead, or dying, and above her stands...

00:16:39.611 --> 00:17:09.027
David Boder: [In Russian] Aha, and what is happening in this picture?

00:17:09.027 --> 00:17:13.748
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] It looks as though women are running away from some air raid.

00:17:13.748 --> 00:17:20.960
David Boder: [In Russian] Aha, and this one?

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:57.756
Boleslaw Czolopicki: [In Polish] [background noise] It’s farm work. On one side...work on a piece of land, cleaning or [background noise; unintelligible]...on the other side some mountaineer with a book in his hand is teaching. A woman [unintelligible].

00:17:57.756 --> 00:17:59.301
David Boder: [In English] Alright.
