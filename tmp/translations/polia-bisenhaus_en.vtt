00:00:00.517 --> 00:00:03.404
David Boder: [In German] Now you talk into this.

00:00:03.404 --> 00:00:04.826
Polia Bisenhaus: Now what shall I talk.

00:00:04.826 --> 00:00:09.279
David Boder: I shall tell you. Now tell me Polia, what is your full name?

00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:10.352

David Boder: [In English] What’s your name?

00:00:12.518 --> 00:00:15.162
Polia Bisenhaus: [In German] My name? Polia Bisenhaus.

00:00:15.162 --> 00:00:16.880
David Boder: Say it again...

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.630
David Boder: [In English] Polia what?

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.036
Polia Bisenhaus: [In German] Polia Bisenhaus.

00:00:19.036 --> 00:00:19.849
David Boder: Bisenhaus?

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:20.821
Polia Bisenhaus: Bisenhaus.

00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:21.515
David Boder: Bisenhaus.

00:00:21.515 --> 00:00:22.047
Polia Bisenhaus: [In French] Yes.

00:00:22.047 --> 00:00:23.422
David Boder: [In Yiddish] Where are you from?

00:00:23.422 --> 00:00:24.670
Polia Bisenhaus: I? - from Poland.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.986
David Boder: You are from Poland?

00:00:25.986 --> 00:00:26.517
Polia Bisenhaus: [In French] Yes.

00:00:26.517 --> 00:00:27.861
David Boder: [In German/Yiddish] From what city in Poland?

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:28.908
Polia Bisenhaus: Stashu.

00:00:28.908 --> 00:00:30.283
David Boder: Stashu?

00:00:30.283 --> 00:00:30.718
Polia Bisenhaus: Hm.

00:00:30.718 --> 00:00:33.736
David Boder: What is that [In English] Russian? [In German/Yiddish] Russian-Poland, or.....?

00:00:33.736 --> 00:00:36.533
Polia Bisenhaus: It was in Poland....

00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:40.743
David Boder: Come nearer a bit. Was it Russian Poland?

00:00:40.743 --> 00:00:46.375
Polia Bisenhaus: Russian Poland. Before the war [a few words not clear] it was Russian Poland.

00:00:46.375 --> 00:00:50.266
David Boder: Yes. But during the war, were the Russians there or....

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:51.217
Polia Bisenhaus: The Russians.

00:00:51.217 --> 00:01:02.707
David Boder: The Russians were there. All right now, tell me, and then when the Russians had left - when did the Germans come? Tell me the whole story.

00:01:02.707 --> 00:01:12.078
Polia Bisenhaus: Well I was not there when the Russians arrived I was already in a lager with the Germans [She apparently refers to the end of the war]. I was not in Stashu.

00:01:12.078 --> 00:01:14.421
David Boder: How did you get to Germany?

00:01:14.421 --> 00:01:33.029
Polia Bisenhaus: I was in Kielce in [locality not clear] in a labor....in an ammunition lager, in a work lager; I worked at ammunitions, and afterwards in the year ’44 I was evacuated to Germany.

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:39.201
David Boder: So. But where did you live when the Russians came?

00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:40.882
Polia Bisenhaus: Well I was not under the Russians.

00:01:40.882 --> 00:01:41.992
David Boder: You were not under the Russians?

00:01:41.992 --> 00:01:44.539
Polia Bisenhaus: I was liberated by the Americans.

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.289
David Boder: And you were not under the Russians.

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.423
Polia Bisenhaus: No, I was not under the Russians, I was liberated by the Americans.

00:01:50.423 --> 00:01:55.347
David Boder: Yes. Now then in what kind of a lager were you? Where were you in a lager?

00:01:55.347 --> 00:02:02.125
Polia Bisenhaus: In Poland I was in a lager, a labor lager; and in Germany I was in an annihilation lager.

00:02:02.125 --> 00:02:03.562
David Boder: An annihilation camp?

00:02:03.562 --> 00:02:04.015
Polia Bisenhaus: [In French] Yes.

00:02:04.015 --> 00:02:07.155
David Boder: [In German/English] Alright. Tell me about that labor camp.

00:02:07.155 --> 00:02:16.313
Polia Bisenhaus: [In German/Yiddish] Well we were working twelve hours a day. One week during the day, one week during the night.

00:02:16.313 --> 00:02:17.595
David Boder: What work did you do?

00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:23.061
Polia Bisenhaus: Ammunitions. That is....ammunitions....

00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:23.624
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:23.624 --> 00:02:24.302
Polia Bisenhaus: /a few words not clear]

00:02:24.302 --> 00:02:26.161
David Boder: Oh. That was a factory.

00:02:26.161 --> 00:02:26.880
Polia Bisenhaus: ....a factory. [In French] Yes.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.677
David Boder: [In German/Yiddish] Now then, and what did they give you to eat?

00:02:31.677 --> 00:02:44.513
Polia Bisenhaus: In Poland it was not bad. In Poland the food was fair, some days there was meat, but in Germany it was very bad.

00:02:44.513 --> 00:02:49.928
David Boder: Aha. But that was in Poland. And how long did you work in Poland?

00:02:49.928 --> 00:02:51.488
Polia Bisenhaus: In Poland? Three years.

00:02:51.488 --> 00:02:54.993
David Boder: Three years. And why were you moved from there?

00:02:54.993 --> 00:03:07.008
Polia Bisenhaus: When the Russians approached Kielce we were sent to Częstochowa. And afterwards, when they approached Częstochowa we were sent to Germany. [two or three words not clear]

00:03:07.008 --> 00:03:12.501
David Boder: Aha. Why did you tell me that you were in an annihilation camp? Which camp was that?

00:03:12.501 --> 00:03:13.750
Polia Bisenhaus: Bergen-Belsen.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.286
David Boder: Bergen-Belsen?

00:03:15.286 --> 00:03:15.860
Polia Bisenhaus: [In French] Oui.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.350
David Boder: [In German/Yiddish] Ohhh! What were you doing there?

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:52.246
Polia Bisenhaus: There we did nothing. We were sitting around and we got no food. We got ten deca of bread [about three ounces] per day, but on certain days there was no bread either. They would say.... the bread did not arrive [??] and they gave us no food. And when the SS would come, and ask “why were you not given food today”, so they said, the SS told us to say that we had stolen.

00:03:52.246 --> 00:03:53.713
David Boder: You should say that?

00:03:53.713 --> 00:03:59.571
Polia Bisenhaus: Yes, that we should say that we had stolen and that is why we don’t get any, we have food punishment.

00:03:59.571 --> 00:04:00.008
David Boder: Aha.

00:04:00.008 --> 00:04:02.874
Polia Bisenhaus: And that is why we got no food.

00:04:02.874 --> 00:04:03.218
David Boder: Aha.

00:04:03.218 --> 00:04:05.328
Polia Bisenhaus: And that happened many times during the week.

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:09.714
David Boder: Aha. And how did you sleep. Tell me about that.

00:04:09.714 --> 00:04:26.675
Polia Bisenhaus: We slept on the ground, and it was....all day we were sitting on the ground, on the same straw, and afterwards at night we slept on the same place. It was very dirty there. Many died from the dirt that was there.

00:04:26.675 --> 00:04:30.909
David Boder: What did the Germans say? Why were you held there?

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:43.067
Polia Bisenhaus: They told us nothing about why they held us there. They did not tell us but we knew, that they held us because they wanted to annihilate us, but they did not succeed.

00:04:43.067 --> 00:04:46.411
David Boder: All right. Did they annihilate there other people?

00:04:46.411 --> 00:05:11.280
Polia Bisenhaus: [two words not clear] When the people were weak, and were becoming weaker from day to day because they were not given any food, so they annihilated them. There was....well a chamber where they gassed [gas-killed] them, and afterwards they burned....well that all is known what the Germans have done.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.574
David Boder: How come you say it is well known? In America they know very little.

00:05:14.574 --> 00:05:23.180
Polia Bisenhaus: Oh, they know in America. The periodicals have written a lot. Don’t they know?

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:30.703
David Boder: Oh yes, some people know, some people don’t. That’s why I want....do you have relatives in America?

00:05:30.703 --> 00:05:32.824
Polia Bisenhaus: Oui, I have relatives in America.

00:05:32.824 --> 00:05:33.933
David Boder: Where are your relatives?

00:05:33.933 --> 00:05:38.209
Polia Bisenhaus: One uncle is in New York and one is in Chicago.

00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:40.579
David Boder: You have an uncle in Chicago?

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:41.115
Polia Bisenhaus: [In French] Yes.

00:05:41.115 --> 00:05:42.247
David Boder: [In German/Yiddish] I am from Chicago.

00:05:42.247 --> 00:05:45.417
Polia Bisenhaus: Bisenhaus. It is the same name.

00:05:45.417 --> 00:05:46.095
David Boder: Bisenhaus?

00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:50.390
Polia Bisenhaus: Bisenhaus. He is an uncle of my father.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.861
David Boder: Do you wish that I should see your uncle?

00:05:52.861 --> 00:05:55.688
Polia Bisenhaus: [In French] Yes! [In German/Yiddish] I should like to see him very much. But I should like....

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:59.466
David Boder: Do you want me to see your uncle, that I should talk to him?

00:05:59.466 --> 00:06:00.804
Polia Bisenhaus: [rather indifferent] Yes, why not?

00:06:00.804 --> 00:06:02.880
David Boder: Do you want to come to America?

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.064
Polia Bisenhaus: I don’t know. I would very much like to go to Palestine.

00:06:06.064 --> 00:06:06.651
David Boder: You want very much....

00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:18.970
Polia Bisenhaus: Because I have there two aunts, and I would like better to go to Palestine. Yes, I think, for me it will be better than in America.

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.675
David Boder: Do you want to say something to your uncle?

00:06:21.675 --> 00:06:23.407
Polia Bisenhaus: To my uncle?

00:06:23.407 --> 00:06:26.304
David Boder: Yes. I shall call him to my house and have him listen to the machine. [There ensuses a conversation. It was apparently not clear to her that the conversation is being recorded] He will hear what you are saying.

00:06:26.304 --> 00:06:30.021
Polia Bisenhaus: What I am saying, he will hear?

00:06:30.021 --> 00:06:31.033
David Boder: Yes, yes.

00:06:31.033 --> 00:06:40.647
Polia Bisenhaus: And what he says I would not hear? Oh, that is no good. I want to hear him too.

00:06:40.647 --> 00:06:44.395
David Boder: [In English] No, no, no. [In German] No, no. Here you may simply say something, just like on a radio.

00:06:44.395 --> 00:06:46.253
Polia Bisenhaus: But I don’t know his address.

00:06:46.253 --> 00:06:49.450
David Boder: Oh, I will find him.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:50.231
Polia Bisenhaus: Yes?

00:06:50.231 --> 00:06:57.028
David Boder: Yes. I shall find him. You will later give me his address. I shall take it down and I will find him.

00:06:57.028 --> 00:06:59.195
Polia Bisenhaus: Right now.

00:06:59.195 --> 00:07:11.151
David Boder: No, no. You just say now what you want to tell to your uncle, and when I shall return to Chicago, I shall have this machine, and I shall ask him to my house and I shall let him hear what you are saying.

00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:14.260
Polia Bisenhaus: So, and when will you be home?

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:14.759
David Boder: In five weeks.

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:15.821
Polia Bisenhaus: Five weeks?

00:07:15.821 --> 00:07:16.445
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:16.445 --> 00:07:18.156
Polia Bisenhaus: Well, that is good [She apparently was unable to grasp the situation].

00:07:18.156 --> 00:07:19.746
David Boder: Now say something.

00:07:19.746 --> 00:07:25.561
Polia Bisenhaus: Now can I say anything? If I could talk to him I would have a lot to say.

00:07:25.561 --> 00:07:27.850
David Boder: Now for example, what would you like to tell to your uncle?

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:32.175
Polia Bisenhaus: What I would like....how he was, how he feels, what is he doing.

00:07:32.175 --> 00:07:34.798
David Boder: So. Do you want him to do something for you?

00:07:34.798 --> 00:07:35.797
Polia Bisenhaus: For you? [She is apparently bewildered by the German second person plural].

00:07:35.797 --> 00:07:39.592
David Boder: Do you want him to do something for you? Has he sent you money?

00:07:39.592 --> 00:07:41.115
Polia Bisenhaus: Well he sends me....yes.

00:07:41.115 --> 00:07:41.708
David Boder: He sends you....?

00:07:41.708 --> 00:07:49.255
Polia Bisenhaus: Yes, but I am learning a trade so that I may earn something myself. It is not nice that the uncle should have to send me [money]. He may send it once, twice, three times, but it is not proper.

00:07:49.255 --> 00:07:49.724
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:49.724 --> 00:07:59.863
Polia Bisenhaus: I am not sick, one does not have to support me, I want to become independent, I want to earn [something] myself.

00:07:59.863 --> 00:08:04.484
David Boder: Speak louder. Is he a rich man, your uncle?

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:06.528
Polia Bisenhaus: Yes, he is not poor.

00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:10.602
David Boder: How many weeks, how many months were you in Belsen, in Belsen?

00:08:10.602 --> 00:08:15.505
Polia Bisenhaus: I was three months in Bergen-Belsen.

00:08:15.505 --> 00:08:16.994
David Boder: Three months?

00:08:16.994 --> 00:08:17.930
Polia Bisenhaus: Three months.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:23.034
David Boder: Were many people exterminated there?

00:08:23.034 --> 00:08:27.331
Polia Bisenhaus: Yes. Many people died. Because at the appell.....

00:08:27.331 --> 00:08:28.009
David Boder: Um.

00:08:28.009 --> 00:08:28.535
Polia Bisenhaus: Do you know what an appell is?

00:08:28.535 --> 00:08:28.910
David Boder: Yes.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:34.117
Polia Bisenhaus: They would call out people, they were going completely naked, with nothing on....

00:08:34.117 --> 00:08:35.818
David Boder: Why had they nothing on?

00:08:35.818 --> 00:08:42.818
Polia Bisenhaus: They have taken away everything that we had yet from home. All their clothes. They have given such stripes.

00:08:42.818 --> 00:08:43.349
David Boder: Yes.

00:08:43.349 --> 00:09:02.963
Polia Bisenhaus: [a few words not clear]....without shoes or stockings we were going around in the greatest....January, in the greatest cold, January, February, these are the greatest colds, and we were going around almost naked, all shorn [?] without food, without sleep, without washing, so many of course died.

00:09:02.963 --> 00:09:09.933
David Boder: Did the Nazie molest the woman, did they.....

00:09:09.933 --> 00:09:11.088
Polia Bisenhaus: ....beat them?

00:09:11.088 --> 00:09:14.975
David Boder: No, I mean were they indescent with the woman?

00:09:14.975 --> 00:09:17.660
Polia Bisenhaus: That of course is understood. [She apparently did not understand the allusion to sex]

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.127
David Boder: [In English] What do you mean, “it is understood?”

00:09:19.127 --> 00:09:37.365
Polia Bisenhaus: [In Yiddish/German] They behaved very badly towards the women. They have beaten us frequently. When one did not stand straight at the appell, when in the cold one would cuddle up next to the other, and they would beat [us] over the head, and otherwise drag us around.

00:09:37.365 --> 00:09:46.201
David Boder: Now tell me for example, what were people doing all day in Belsen. Say you got up in the morning - at what time?

00:09:46.201 --> 00:09:52.623
Polia Bisenhaus: In the morning there was an appell to get up say at four o’clock, three o’clock, five o’clock.

00:09:52.623 --> 00:09:52.623
David Boder: Nu.

00:09:52.623 --> 00:10:04.892
Polia Bisenhaus: So we went to wash. For washing there was a room a very small one; cold water very cold, and we would go in there completely naked, and many of us caught cold.

00:10:04.892 --> 00:10:05.578
David Boder: Yes.

00:10:05.578 --> 00:10:09.543
Polia Bisenhaus: And the organism [She uses the word organ with a slurred ending] is weak, one did not eat; one washes himself with cold water.

00:10:09.543 --> 00:10:11.589
David Boder: Were there men or women who.....

00:10:11.589 --> 00:10:13.604
Polia Bisenhaus: Women, these were.

00:10:13.604 --> 00:10:15.415
David Boder: I mean the Nazis.

00:10:15.415 --> 00:10:22.632
Polia Bisenhaus: The Nazis? There were women and men. But the women were much worse to us. They were much worse to us than the men.

00:10:22.632 --> 00:10:23.631
David Boder: How come?

00:10:23.631 --> 00:10:41.938
Polia Bisenhaus: Well, the women were beating us terribly, they were beating us. There were many Jews [women] Turkish and Romanian [Jews] who were the lager leaders, lager                        trusties and they were much worse than the Nazis.

00:10:41.938 --> 00:10:44.950
David Boder: You mean to say there were Jewish lager leaders?

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:45.684
Polia Bisenhaus: Yes.

00:10:45.684 --> 00:10:46.787
David Boder: And....

00:10:46.787 --> 00:10:50.192
Polia Bisenhaus: And they were very mean to us, very mean.

00:10:50.192 --> 00:10:53.119
David Boder: There were Jewish lager leaders and they have.....

00:10:53.119 --> 00:10:56.554
Polia Bisenhaus: Yes, yes, they behaved very mean.

00:10:56.554 --> 00:10:57.834
David Boder: Towards the other Jews?

00:10:57.834 --> 00:11:00.269
Polia Bisenhaus: Yes, yes. Very mean.

00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:09.228
David Boder: Now tell me then. You would get up at three, four in the morning, and you went to wash, then what?

00:11:09.228 --> 00:11:18.112
Polia Bisenhaus: Yes, afterwards they have gave us coffee, black coffee; many times we would not get that either, and without bread.

00:11:18.112 --> 00:11:18.861
David Boder: Without bread. [In English] All right.

00:11:18.861 --> 00:11:44.765
Polia Bisenhaus: [In Yiddish/German] Yes. And afterwards at twelve o’clock, half past eleven, eleven, however it would happen, it was dinner time. At dinner time there was a bit of soup, three-quarters of a liter, sometimes half a liter, sometimes not even a half a liter, that was with turnips. If one would find three pieces of turnips in a soup that was considered already very good. That was already a good soup.

00:11:44.765 --> 00:11:45.296
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:45.296 --> 00:11:56.802
Polia Bisenhaus: And afterwards at five o’clock at four o’clock, sometimes at six o’clock there was bread, a little piece of bread, divided among ten people, twelve people.

00:11:56.802 --> 00:11:57.442
David Boder: Hm....

00:11:57.442 --> 00:12:03.165
Polia Bisenhaus: It would come out maybe eight deca of bread, ten deca of bread a piece. That was the meal.

00:12:03.165 --> 00:12:07.442
David Boder: And then in the evening. And then what were you doing after the meal?

00:12:07.442 --> 00:12:13.864
Polia Bisenhaus: Afterwards we kept on sitting like all of the day. During the appell we got our dinner.

00:12:13.864 --> 00:12:14.301
David Boder: Oh.

00:12:14.301 --> 00:12:17.330
Polia Bisenhaus: The appell took place every day.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.952
David Boder: What do you call the appell? What was the appell?

00:12:19.952 --> 00:12:40.822
Polia Bisenhaus: The appell is the count, whether somebody had escaped, whether somebody had died, so they would know exactly how many are to be handed over to the [next]shift, how many there were in the lager.

00:12:40.822 --> 00:12:31.261
David Boder: Aha.

00:12:31.261 --> 00:12:44.279
Polia Bisenhaus: How many women, men....[?] It happened many times that the appell lasted four, five hours. And many people collapsed at the appell, from the cold and from fatigue, from hunger.

00:12:44.279 --> 00:12:45.824
David Boder: And what was done with them?

00:12:45.824 --> 00:13:09.719
Polia Bisenhaus: [She apparently did not get the question]. Well afterwards we went....often they made an appell - not to stand outdoors [??] but they took us to work. The work consisted in carrying sticks, all kinds of lumber from one yard into the other. That was the work.....was nothing, but they beat us many times when we could not run so fast and [word not clear].

00:13:09.719 --> 00:13:14.183
David Boder: Hm....now tell me was there a doctor?

00:13:14.183 --> 00:13:17.804
Polia Bisenhaus: Yes, there was a doctor, a dentist.

00:13:17.804 --> 00:13:23.892
David Boder: A dentist, did he do anything for the prisoners? Did he do something for them?

00:13:23.892 --> 00:13:30.982
Polia Bisenhaus: Well, he pulled teeth. He pulled them out if one had a toothache, he took out teeth.

00:13:30.982 --> 00:13:32.899
David Boder: [In English/Yiddish] Was it a German doctor?

00:13:32.899 --> 00:13:36.515
Polia Bisenhaus: [In Yiddish/German] No. [??] There was a German doctor, there was a Jewish doctor.

00:13:36.515 --> 00:13:37.899
David Boder: A Jewish doctor....

00:13:37.899 --> 00:13:39.116
Polia Bisenhaus: A Jewish doctor.

00:13:39.116 --> 00:13:49.762
David Boder: Aha. And [a pause] tell me and then how were you liberated?

00:13:49.762 --> 00:13:53.814
Polia Bisenhaus: Liberated I was from Dachau by the Americans.

00:13:53.814 --> 00:13:55.799
David Boder: Now come, were you sent from Belsen....?

00:13:55.799 --> 00:13:58.671
Polia Bisenhaus: From Belsen there were afterwards still three lagers.

00:13:58.671 --> 00:14:00.625
David Boder: Tell me about them.

00:14:00.625 --> 00:14:04.527
Polia Bisenhaus: After Belsen we were in Burgau, and afterwards in Turkenheim.

00:14:04.527 --> 00:14:05.276
David Boder: [In English] Yes.

00:14:05.276 --> 00:14:23.347
Polia Bisenhaus: [In Yiddish/German] In Burgau we were three weeks, or four weeks. Afterwards, in Turkenheim I was two weeks. Afterwards when [one word not clear] the Americans approached we were led to Dachau and there we were liberated, the 30-th of ....

00:14:23.347 --> 00:14:29.999
David Boder: Now were you transported from one lager to the other, by train, by truck, how?

00:14:29.999 --> 00:14:37.163
Polia Bisenhaus: From Bergen-Belsen to Burgau we traveled in wagons [RR cars].

00:14:37.163 --> 00:14:38.006
David Boder: In wagons?

00:14:38.006 --> 00:14:38.755
Polia Bisenhaus: In wagons.

00:14:38.755 --> 00:14:40.784
David Boder: And how long did that last?

00:14:40.784 --> 00:14:46.355
Polia Bisenhaus: It lasted a whole eight days. Eight days it lasted - the trip.

00:14:46.355 --> 00:14:46.792
David Boder: And...

00:14:46.792 --> 00:14:54.886
Polia Bisenhaus: And we did not get any food on the way, and there were bombardments, and many were killed by bombs.

00:14:54.886 --> 00:14:56.719
David Boder: Were also your people killed, how come?

00:14:56.719 --> 00:14:57.733
Polia Bisenhaus: Yes, yes.

00:14:57.733 --> 00:14:59.169
David Boder: How, did the bombs fall....

00:14:59.169 --> 00:14:59.877
Polia Bisenhaus: The bombs fell

00:14:59.877 --> 00:15:00.626
David Boder: On the train?

00:15:00.626 --> 00:15:04.962
Polia Bisenhaus: On the train, one could not run away.

00:15:04.962 --> 00:15:07.667
David Boder: How could you run away if you were in the train?

00:15:07.667 --> 00:15:10.646
Polia Bisenhaus: Well, on the other side...

00:15:10.646 --> 00:15:12.269
David Boder: Oh, the train was standing?

00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:16.640
Polia Bisenhaus: When they bombarded the train would stand.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.106
David Boder: And the Nazis too?

00:15:19.106 --> 00:15:26.442
Polia Bisenhaus: The Nazis have run away. They hid. They were shooting, they shot at the planes and ...

00:15:26.442 --> 00:15:30.203
David Boder: Did they permit you to hide?

00:15:30.203 --> 00:15:37.355
Polia Bisenhaus: They did not see it. They themselves were in a mix-up, because they themselves wanted to run away.

00:15:37.355 --> 00:15:41.285
David Boder: Well then....and then you marched eight days, where from?

00:15:41.285 --> 00:15:46.404
Polia Bisenhaus: And then we marched eight days from Turkenheim to Dachau.

00:15:46.404 --> 00:15:51.711
David Boder: Turkenheim to Dachau. Now tell me you came to Dachau. What were you doing there?

00:15:51.711 --> 00:16:34.582
Polia Bisenhaus: In Dachau it was already a few days before liberation. We arrived, and the SS said to the leaders, who brought us: ‘Why did you bring these people, I don’t need them;’ So they said, ‘we don’t know, because they wanted to hide [save themselves], what shall we do with these people?’ And the SS leader said: ‘Oh I know well what to do with these people.’ He lined us up, and we thought that they were going to shoot us, because there was a rumor [??] that so will be done with all Jews. Afterwards there came an order, and they ran away, and when the gestapo saw this they ran away. And afterwards we were led into a block, already there were....

00:16:34.582 --> 00:16:35.581
David Boder: What do you mean?

00:16:35.581 --> 00:17:07.929
Polia Bisenhaus: The SS already behaved themselves with the Jews, the Jews already started taking over. They saw that liberation was near, they took us into a block [she speaks with excitement]. The people were tired, eight days walking on foot, and in the morning when we came out we saw no more SS. They were all gone. And in the air up high were people standing and they showed white flags [??] and there were standing already Jewish prisoners.

00:17:07.929 --> 00:17:08.616
David Boder: Jewish prisoners?

00:17:08.616 --> 00:17:09.051
Polia Bisenhaus: Jewish prisoners, with guns, and they have taken over the service from the Nazis.

00:17:09.051 --> 00:17:09.385
David Boder: Yes. Now....

00:17:09.385 --> 00:17:14.376
Polia Bisenhaus: One saw that things have changed.

00:17:14.376 --> 00:17:15.571
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:15.571 --> 00:17:27.647
Polia Bisenhaus: Afterwards the Nazis tried to get out of the lager, they still wanted to kill the few Jews, but they failed, because the Americans had come.

00:17:27.647 --> 00:17:31.050
David Boder: They failed. So how many days were you in Dachau?

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:36.074
Polia Bisenhaus: In Dachau I was three weeks already after liberation. Afterwards..

00:17:36.074 --> 00:17:38.697
David Boder: But before liberation? How long were you....

00:17:38.697 --> 00:17:40.414
Polia Bisenhaus: Well I was there two days.

00:17:40.414 --> 00:17:41.397
David Boder: Two days only, in Dachau.

00:17:41.397 --> 00:17:42.592
Polia Bisenhaus: Yes, two days.

00:17:42.592 --> 00:17:43.981
David Boder: And then came liberation.

00:17:43.981 --> 00:17:49.075
Polia Bisenhaus: Then came liberation. And we were liberated by the Americans, and that was already good.

00:17:49.075 --> 00:17:54.085
David Boder: Yes. Were many SS arrested when the Americans came?

00:17:54.085 --> 00:18:06.830
Polia Bisenhaus: Yes, many were arrested, but the Americans did not do anything. They [the prisoners] recognized an SS who did much evil to the Jews[??], but the Americans did not permit to do anything to him.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:07.923
David Boder: What did the Americans do?

00:18:07.923 --> 00:18:09.530
Polia Bisenhaus: They did not want to do anything.

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:11.075
David Boder: They did not permit....

00:18:11.075 --> 00:18:11.855
Polia Bisenhaus: No, they did not permit

00:18:11.855 --> 00:18:13.036
David Boder: ....to do anything to him.

00:18:13.036 --> 00:18:13.723
Polia Bisenhaus: [In English] No.

00:18:13.723 --> 00:18:19.124
David Boder: [In German/Yiddish] So where did the Jewish men get the rifles....?

00:18:19.124 --> 00:18:23.562
Polia Bisenhaus: They did not get them, they took them from the Nazis, when they threw away their rifles.

00:18:23.562 --> 00:18:24.361
David Boder: Oh.

00:18:24.361 --> 00:18:25.616
Polia Bisenhaus: And they took them right away.

00:18:25.616 --> 00:18:31.126
David Boder: Aha. And now how did you happen to come to Paris?

00:18:31.126 --> 00:18:35.434
Polia Bisenhaus: To Paris I was taken by an uncle and an aunt.

00:18:35.434 --> 00:18:36.948
David Boder: Where from? From Paris?

00:18:36.948 --> 00:18:38.872
Polia Bisenhaus: Yes, they were already here.

00:18:38.872 --> 00:18:40.464
David Boder: Oh, they have lived already in Paris?

00:18:40.464 --> 00:18:41.697
Polia Bisenhaus: Yes, they lived in Paris [??]

00:18:41.697 --> 00:18:42.758
David Boder: Did you have the address?

00:18:42.758 --> 00:18:48.158
Polia Bisenhaus: No, I had no address, but they found out from a [word not clear] from a list.

00:18:48.158 --> 00:18:48.985
David Boder: Yes.

00:18:48.985 --> 00:19:08.842
Polia Bisenhaus: It was sent out from the lager, so it became known in America. The uncle made inquiries in Paris, who....that was the Bisenhaus from Labush [??]. The first did not know, and they did not know me, because I was still very fatigued [??], afterwards they found out they took me over here.

00:19:08.842 --> 00:19:12.088
David Boder: They took you over to Paris. And how long are you now in Paris?

00:19:12.088 --> 00:19:13.727
Polia Bisenhaus: In Paris I am six months.

00:19:13.727 --> 00:19:17.957
David Boder: Six months. And you plan to go to Palestine.

00:19:17.957 --> 00:19:18.706
Polia Bisenhaus: Hm.

00:19:18.706 --> 00:19:20.345
David Boder: Better than to go to America?

00:19:20.345 --> 00:19:21.672
Polia Bisenhaus: Better than to go to America.

00:19:21.672 --> 00:19:24.295
David Boder: Who do you know. Who do you have in Palestine?

00:19:24.295 --> 00:19:25.918
Polia Bisenhaus: In Palestine I have two aunts.

00:19:25.918 --> 00:19:27.135
David Boder: Where?

00:19:27.135 --> 00:19:29.835
Polia Bisenhaus: [words not clear] in Hadera [??]

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:34.924
David Boder: And you think that they can take you over.

00:19:34.924 --> 00:19:39.149
Polia Bisenhaus: They don’t know me but I have to go there through a Kibbutz a Hachshara.

00:19:39.149 --> 00:19:40.638
David Boder: Through what?

00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:43.375
Polia Bisenhaus: I can go through a Hachshara, through a Kibbutz.

00:19:43.375 --> 00:19:44.868
David Boder: Do you understand Hebrew?

00:19:44.868 --> 00:19:49.767
Polia Bisenhaus: No, I don’t know. The little I knew I have forgotten, because I study now French.

00:19:49.767 --> 00:19:55.786
David Boder: You study French here, and your uncle and aunt live here already a long time?

00:19:55.786 --> 00:19:58.379
Polia Bisenhaus: Yes. They are here already seventeen years.

00:19:58.379 --> 00:20:03.202
David Boder: Aha. I wish to ask you for something.

00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:03.732
Polia Bisenhaus: Yes.

00:20:03.732 --> 00:20:15.157
David Boder: I am a professor who studies these things you understand. But I shall see, if you give me the address of your uncle....

00:20:15.157 --> 00:20:21.127
Polia Bisenhaus: I have the address at home.

00:20:21.127 --> 00:20:23.870
David Boder: I shall be here tomorrow and after tomorrow.

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:26.699
Polia Bisenhaus: Yes, yes. Will you come here...in the morning too?

00:20:26.699 --> 00:20:27.146
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:27.146 --> 00:20:28.439
Polia Bisenhaus: Well I will bring the address...

00:20:28.439 --> 00:20:28.655
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:28.655 --> 00:20:30.044
Polia Bisenhaus: . . . for my uncle, yes?

00:20:30.044 --> 00:20:31.435
David Boder: Yes. And I will visit your uncle then...

00:20:31.435 --> 00:20:37.954
Polia Bisenhaus: Yes, he will be very interested...you will tell him you have seen me at ORT...

00:20:37.954 --> 00:20:39.858
David Boder: Yes. He will be very happy.

00:20:39.858 --> 00:20:41.271
Polia Bisenhaus: Well, yes. Naturally!

00:20:41.271 --> 00:21:00.304
David Boder: [In German/Yiddish/English] [unintelligible] [Here I showed her one of the TAT cards. —D.P.B.] This is a picture by a prominent artist. From the last three years of your experiences, what do you think does this picture mean?

00:21:00.304 --> 00:21:13.839
Polia Bisenhaus: [In Yiddish/German] Well this picture is of a woman, I believe she has lost everything, who is worried about what to do, she has no way out.

00:21:13.839 --> 00:21:17.283
David Boder: And what do you think is this picture about?

00:21:17.283 --> 00:21:25.073
Polia Bisenhaus: This picture is about the war, this is about the war.

00:21:25.073 --> 00:21:26.751
David Boder: Yes, go on.

00:21:26.751 --> 00:21:32.170
Polia Bisenhaus: That is [word not clear]

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:35.401
David Boder: Yes, what do you think happened to him?

00:21:35.401 --> 00:21:52.393
Polia Bisenhaus: Well he has lost everything. The whole family, he has remained alone. [word not clear] I too have remained alone of the whole family.

00:21:52.393 --> 00:21:53.805
David Boder: And what is this?

00:21:53.805 --> 00:21:58.404
Polia Bisenhaus: And this. I don’t know. It is a [word not clear].

00:21:58.404 --> 00:22:00.655
David Boder: But what do you think?

00:22:00.655 --> 00:22:10.571
Polia Bisenhaus: I think he is thinking about his wife, who has died. And this is his daughter. I don’t know [word not clear].

00:22:10.571 --> 00:22:13.166
David Boder: And what do you think is this?

00:22:13.166 --> 00:22:30.520
Polia Bisenhaus: This? [a pause, she says only a few words which are not clear].

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.162
David Boder: And what do think is this?

00:22:32.162 --> 00:22:42.931
Polia Bisenhaus: [a few words not clear]

00:22:42.931 --> 00:22:44.025
David Boder: And what do you think is this?

00:22:44.025 --> 00:22:48.247
Polia Bisenhaus: Is it not Palestine?

00:22:48.247 --> 00:22:58.045
David Boder: Maybe.

00:22:58.045 --> 00:23:02.369
Polia Bisenhaus: Maybe. He works, he works in the field, and that is very nice.

00:23:02.369 --> 00:23:05.539
David Boder: Tell me, do you have a father and mother?

00:23:05.539 --> 00:23:09.004
Polia Bisenhaus: No. my father and mother were deported with the whole family.

00:23:09.004 --> 00:23:10.191
David Boder: When were they deported?

00:23:10.191 --> 00:23:12.353
Polia Bisenhaus: Five or six years ago [??]

00:23:12.353 --> 00:23:14.243
David Boder: When you were still in Kielce.

00:23:14.243 --> 00:23:45.826
Polia Bisenhaus: Yes, when I still was in Kielce. I was still home. I was sent from Kielce, we were taken to the city where there was a .....shop [She uses the English word - like so many DPs] for all kinds of trades. And I went to the shop, money was paid [apparently a bribe to gain occupational deferment from deportation] and I was accepted, and afterwards I was eight [eighteen??] days I was in the shop and then I was sent to Kielce. And the family was deported and I don’t know where they are.

00:23:45.826 --> 00:23:47.841
David Boder: When was the family deported?

00:23:47.841 --> 00:23:52.256
Polia Bisenhaus: ’42.

00:23:52.256 --> 00:23:57.264

00:23:57.264 --> 00:24:01.994
Polia Bisenhaus: Oh, the Germans had come in ’39. In ’39....

00:24:01.994 --> 00:24:02.837
David Boder: Yes.

00:24:02.837 --> 00:24:05.825
Polia Bisenhaus: ....and the parents were deported in ’42.

00:24:05.825 --> 00:24:07.384
David Boder: The parents were deported in ’42.

00:24:07.384 --> 00:24:08.539

David Boder: Were you home when they were deported?

00:24:11.304 --> 00:24:13.715
Polia Bisenhaus: No I was not home.

00:24:13.715 --> 00:24:14.590

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:15.025

00:24:15.025 --> 00:24:17.665

00:24:17.665 --> 00:24:22.294
Polia Bisenhaus: I had[word not clear] but I am alone of the six of the whole family [there is a great deal of noise, the last sentence may be incorrect].

00:24:22.294 --> 00:24:25.215
David Boder: How many brothers and sisters did you have?

00:24:25.215 --> 00:24:28.069
Polia Bisenhaus: I had two brothers, and three sisters.

00:24:28.069 --> 00:24:29.203
David Boder: And where are they?

00:24:29.203 --> 00:24:38.495
Polia Bisenhaus: Deported. My brothers were in Skarżysko and they are no more. Maybe they were murdered in Skarżysko.

00:24:38.495 --> 00:24:44.739
David Boder: Now what shall I tell your uncle in Chicago?

00:24:44.739 --> 00:24:47.775
Polia Bisenhaus: Now whatever you want to tell him. That you have....

00:24:47.775 --> 00:24:49.352
David Boder: Are you all right here

00:24:49.352 --> 00:24:53.191
Polia Bisenhaus: Yes. I have it good here, with my aunt, with my uncle.

00:24:53.191 --> 00:24:55.996

00:24:55.996 --> 00:24:59.370

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:01.284

00:25:09.591 --> 00:25:11.605
David Boder: And what are you doing in the day time? [The interview took place at an ORT night school.]

00:25:11.605 --> 00:25:15.336
Polia Bisenhaus: During the day I do nothing. Now I do nothing.

00:25:15.336 --> 00:25:16.522
David Boder: Don’t you work?

00:25:16.522 --> 00:25:23.816
Polia Bisenhaus: No I do not work during the day. [It was hard for DPs to get work permits in Paris.]

00:25:23.816 --> 00:25:34.302
