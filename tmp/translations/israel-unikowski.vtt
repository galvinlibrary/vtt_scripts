00:00:07.048 --> 00:00:23.099
David Boder: [In English] August 2nd, 1946, Chateau Bouciaut, near Paris, of the organization of OSE. This is Israel Us...Unikowski.

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:24.103
David Boder: [In German] [whispers] How old are you?

00:00:24.103 --> 00:00:25.278
Israel Unikowski: I am eighteen years.

00:00:25.278 --> 00:01:10.702
David Boder: [In English] Eighteen years old, who should prefer to speak from a previously prepared, written story of his life. But he was convinced that we insist exclusively upon verbal reports without notes or memoranda. Eh...he is rather reluctant to do it, but he was convinced, by Dr. Reich and myself, at least to try. He said that is the first time in his life. Well, we don’t think that his life, in spite of all his experiences, precludes to do anything for the first time.

00:01:10.702 --> 00:01:19.377
David Boder: [In German] And so, Israel, tell me your full name and how old you are.

00:01:19.377 --> 00:01:26.034
Israel Unikowski: Israel Unikowski. Born in Kalish, Poland, nineteen twenty-eight.

00:01:26.034 --> 00:01:29.829
David Boder: Nineteen twenty-eight. So how old are you now?

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.666
Israel Unikowski: I am eighteen and a half years.

00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:35.371
David Boder: Eighteen and a half years. You are born in Kalish in Poland?

00:01:35.371 --> 00:01:35.763
Israel Unikowski: Yes.

00:01:35.763 --> 00:01:48.208
David Boder: Yes. Nu, Israel, tell me first of all...eh...how large was your family and what was your father’s occupation?

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:51.534
Israel Unikowski: My father left Poland in nine...

00:01:51.534 --> 00:01:52.454
David Boder: One moment! Yes.

00:01:52.454 --> 00:01:54.039
Israel Unikowski: . . . in nineteen thirty five.

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.411
David Boder: Oh.

00:01:54.411 --> 00:01:58.735
Israel Unikowski: The mother died when I was three years. Three and a half years.

00:01:58.735 --> 00:02:00.124
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:00.124 --> 00:02:04.565
Israel Unikowski: I was raised in...in an orphan’s home.

00:02:04.565 --> 00:02:05.054
David Boder: In what?

00:02:05.054 --> 00:02:06.150
Israel Unikowski: In an orphan’s home.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.341
David Boder: In an orphan’s home. Yes?

00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:11.393
Israel Unikowski: In the year nineteen thirty-nine, at the outbreak of the war...

00:02:11.393 --> 00:02:11.804
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:11.804 --> 00:02:25.905
Israel Unikowski: . . . the personnel of...of the orphanage ran away and we boys, there were thirty two persons, we ran away from Kalish. The German stood already not far away. We wanted to get into Lodz.

00:02:25.905 --> 00:02:31.618
David Boder: Aha. Now, and so how do we stand? You were thirty-two boys in an orphanage.

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:32.107
Israel Unikowski: Yes.

00:02:32.107 --> 00:02:33.672
David Boder: How old were the children there?

00:02:33.672 --> 00:02:35.765
Israel Unikowski: From five to thirteen years.

00:02:35.765 --> 00:02:36.489
David Boder: From five to thirteen years.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.428
Israel Unikowski: Thirteen years.

00:02:37.428 --> 00:02:38.974
David Boder: And how old were you?

00:02:38.974 --> 00:02:40.246
Israel Unikowski: I? Twelve years.

00:02:40.246 --> 00:02:46.252
David Boder: You were twelve years. So how was that? All ran away and they didn’t take the children with them?

00:02:46.252 --> 00:02:46.859
Israel Unikowski: No.

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:47.309
David Boder: No.

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:49.676
Israel Unikowski: En route we did meet one [of them]

00:02:49.676 --> 00:02:56.700
David Boder: Yes. But of the...of the orphanage. Did the grown-ups leave and leave the children there?

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.946
Israel Unikowski: Yes. As far...as far as one town they did travel with us...

00:03:00.946 --> 00:03:01.220
David Boder: Oh!

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.864
Israel Unikowski: Poddebice!

00:03:02.864 --> 00:03:03.255
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:03.255 --> 00:03:04.918
Israel Unikowski: But afterwards they left.

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:11.374
David Boder: Oh. Then we have it like this: From the orphanage you went away together. Who? The grown-ups and the...

00:03:11.374 --> 00:03:13.272
Israel Unikowski: One. The supervisor.

00:03:13.272 --> 00:03:14.759
David Boder: The supervisor with the children?

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:15.248
Israel Unikowski: Yes.

00:03:15.248 --> 00:03:17.420
David Boder: How did you travel?

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.063
Israel Unikowski: We rented a cart.

00:03:19.063 --> 00:03:19.239
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.843
Israel Unikowski: It was Saturday night...

00:03:20.843 --> 00:03:21.137
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:21.137 --> 00:03:22.900
Israel Unikowski: . . . and we travelled to Poddebice.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.868
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:23.868 --> 00:03:24.120
Israel Unikowski: And...

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.476
David Boder: How, thirty-two children on one cart?

00:03:25.476 --> 00:03:27.084
Israel Unikowski: Yes. On one cart. One cart.

00:03:27.084 --> 00:03:32.565
David Boder: On one cart. Hm. So he took them out from there. Did they take any things?

00:03:32.565 --> 00:03:36.950
Israel Unikowski: The things were taken on another cart that followed. But not with us.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:37.299
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:38.422
Israel Unikowski: But we never saw our things anymore.

00:03:38.422 --> 00:03:40.708
David Boder: And where were you bound for?

00:03:40.708 --> 00:03:45.705
Israel Unikowski: And we went...we travelled to Poddebice, and coming into the city we stayed there overnight.

00:03:45.705 --> 00:03:45.879
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.203
Israel Unikowski: In the morning we heard that the Germans were approaching.

00:03:48.203 --> 00:03:48.823
David Boder: Yes?

00:03:48.823 --> 00:03:57.730
Israel Unikowski: We...we started on foot, because carts were too expensive. They demanded a lot of money, so that we couldn’t rent a cart. We began to walk.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.822
David Boder: And what happened to the cart that you had?

00:03:59.822 --> 00:04:02.166
Israel Unikowski: It wasn’t our own. It was a rented cart from a Christian.

00:04:02.166 --> 00:04:03.173
David Boder: It was a cart rented from a...

00:04:03.173 --> 00:04:03.851
Israel Unikowski: From a Christian.

00:04:03.851 --> 00:04:07.027
David Boder: From a Christian. So, the Christian...Where did the Christian go with the cart?

00:04:07.027 --> 00:04:08.751
Israel Unikowski: The Christian went back.

00:04:08.751 --> 00:04:09.138
David Boder: Back.

00:04:09.138 --> 00:04:11.617
Israel Unikowski: And we started on foot to Lodz.

00:04:11.617 --> 00:04:12.915
David Boder: Hm.

00:04:12.915 --> 00:04:17.234
Israel Unikowski: We arrived in Alexander. This is a small town near Lodz.

00:04:17.234 --> 00:04:18.280
David Boder: Yes?

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.600
Israel Unikowski: There in Alexander we stayed overnight.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.084
David Boder: Hm.

00:04:23.084 --> 00:04:41.721
Israel Unikowski: In the middle of the night the Polish troops began to retreat from the front. A lot of troops marched so that we couldn’t remain in the city. We knew the Germans were approaching. The supervisor who took care of the children went outside. He went over to a Polish soldier. He wanted to know how to get to Lodz. It was a terribly dark night.

00:04:41.721 --> 00:04:42.437
David Boder: Hm.

00:04:42.437 --> 00:04:49.758
Israel Unikowski: Then...What happened to him afterwards we don’t know. He disappeared then.

00:04:49.758 --> 00:04:56.014
David Boder: [adjusting the instrument]. Nu, what happened then? Go on. Continue.

00:04:56.014 --> 00:05:57.028
Israel Unikowski: The boys divided into two groups. The older ones said we should go to Lodz; the younger ones said we should return to Kalisz. It was decided to go to Lodz, because...because we knew if we return to Kalisz we will fall into the Germans hands. We arrived in Lodz at daybreak. At daybreak, on the Alexander street, we met a group of Christians and Jews who lived on the outskirts of the city. We were sat down near a church. When we were asked where we are coming from and we said from Kalisz, nobody wanted to believe us. We ate a piece of bread, and we started to inquire how to get to the Jewish Council. The Jewish Council was very far from Alexander street. It was on Pomorska 19. We arrived on Pomorska street. We went near the Council. There stood a guard. We were not let in. ‘Where do you come from?’ ‘From Kalisz.’

00:05:57.028 --> 00:05:59.953
David Boder: All...How many children were you there? The whole...the whole...

00:05:59.953 --> 00:06:01.134
Israel Unikowski: All the thirty-two people.

00:06:01.134 --> 00:06:01.871
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:01.871 --> 00:07:27.605
Israel Unikowski: We weren’t let in. It was said that the whole Council had run away. Jews passed by. They began to ask, ‘Where are you from? Who are you?’ And when we told them, we were told that opposite Pormorska 19 there is also an orphanage that belonged to the [Jewish] community, and since nobody was there now, and if we want, we can go in there. Needless to say we were tired from the journey and we went in there. But we couldn’t stay like this without food so we/decided...we chose a delagation of two older boys. I was among the two, and we were supposed to go the Council to find out what will be. We came up to the Council with great difficulty. They let us enter. We were met...we were received by an old man completely gray. We go over to him. We showed him a paper that we are from there and there, that we are from Kalisz. We showed him a paper that we ask that the community of Lodz should take care of us [?]. The old man, who was the [one] later known as President Rumkowski, stopped us, read the petition, and answered us, ‘Dear children, I have nothing to help you.’ He took us through all the rooms. The bureaus [desks] were overturned, a disorder. And he gave us back the paper, ‘With me you can’t remain. You will die from hunger.’ We left the paper in his hand, and we went down. Downstairs...

00:07:27.605 --> 00:07:29.058
David Boder: What kind of a paper?

00:07:29.058 --> 00:07:30.956
Israel Unikowski: We had a paper from the Kalisz [Jewish] community...

00:07:30.956 --> 00:07:31.460
David Boder: Hm.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.951
Israel Unikowski: . . . that we should be received in Lodz.

00:07:32.951 --> 00:07:34.327
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:34.327 --> 00:08:20.553
Israel Unikowski: Coming down he threw after us, down the stairs, the paper, and we returned. The children asked us all about it, and we said..we said that it is very bad. And so we waited a few hours. About five o’clock Rumkowski came. He entered the room. [Noise on the wire sounds like an airplane passing overhead.] He asked, ‘Who is here from Kalisz?’ We stood up, and he said thus, ‘Dear children, don’t worry. You will have to eat and to drink.’ And he said that we will remain here. So we came to live on Pomorska 19. On Pomorska 19 we lived for two months when began the...

00:08:20.553 --> 00:08:23.613
David Boder: Did they bring you food? Were you given to eat on Pomorska 19?

00:08:23.613 --> 00:08:24.795
Israel Unikowski: Not good, but...

00:08:24.795 --> 00:08:25.086
David Boder: Of course.

00:08:25.086 --> 00:08:36.289
Israel Unikowski: . . . it was war. And there was a special bakery that was baking bread for us. In town people still ate white bread, but we didn’t eat any more white bread, just black bread, very inferior bread. A lot of children died of dysentery also.

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:39.020
David Boder: What is this? The...the...from the...what is the...

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.073
Israel Unikowski: This is from Auschwitz. The number.

00:08:41.073 --> 00:09:00.439
David Boder: Eh...[In English] I notice on his left arm the following tattoo B-7687. He tells me that that is the tattoo that was made on his arm in Auschwitz—All right. Nu?

00:09:00.439 --> 00:09:25.731
Israel Unikowski: This was in the winter, nineteen forty-four...[corrects himself] nineteen thirty-nine. There was the first expulsion from Lodz. It was said then that people may travel wherever they want, and so we traveled to Kalisz [?]. In Kalisz we...we were supposed to catch a train, and from there we...we were supposed to travel wherever one desired. So it was said. The Kierownik of the orphanage.

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:26.796
David Boder: What does Kierownik mean?

00:09:26.796 --> 00:09:27.397
Israel Unikowski: The supervisor [?]...

00:09:27.397 --> 00:09:28.695
David Boder: The caretaker? Well?

00:09:28.695 --> 00:09:30.729
Israel Unikowski: Yes, the leader. I don’t know...

00:09:30.729 --> 00:09:30.884
David Boder: Yes.

00:09:30.884 --> 00:09:31.523
Israel Unikowski: . . . how to say it in English.

00:09:31.523 --> 00:09:33.615
David Boder: Yes.

00:09:33.615 --> 00:09:41.382
Israel Unikowski: He packed up. We saw he was going to leave. [Pause.] He...the boys...

00:09:41.382 --> 00:09:44.365
David Boder: So he was with you through the whole two months, this Kierownik?

00:09:44.365 --> 00:09:45.585
Israel Unikowski: It was another one. This was the...

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:46.766
David Boder: Oh. This was another one?

00:09:46.766 --> 00:09:49.323
Israel Unikowski: This was another one that Rumkowski appointed. From Lodz.

00:09:49.323 --> 00:09:51.279
David Boder: Nu? Did he...

00:09:51.279 --> 00:09:52.983
Israel Unikowski: I had a brother there.

00:09:52.983 --> 00:09:53.487
David Boder: Where?

00:09:53.487 --> 00:10:00.072
Israel Unikowski: In the orphanage also. A bro-...he was a year older than I. We decided that we two will also go away.

00:10:00.072 --> 00:10:01.447
David Boder: The brother was the older one?

00:10:01.447 --> 00:10:02.590
Israel Unikowski: A year older.

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:03.268
David Boder: Hm.

00:10:03.268 --> 00:10:10.473
Israel Unikowski: We decided that the two of us will leave for Russia. We will go till Kaliszek. In Kaliszek we will take a train for Warsaw and from Warsaw we will go on foot to Bialystok.

00:10:10.473 --> 00:10:12.061
David Boder: Where did one take the money?

00:10:12.061 --> 00:10:16.962
Israel Unikowski: The community gave fifty zlotys to everyone who wanted to leave Lodz. So it was said. Whether it was true I don’t know.

00:10:16.962 --> 00:10:18.376
David Boder: Oh, you didn’t have the money yet?

00:10:18.376 --> 00:10:31.770
Israel Unikowski: No, no. We arrived in Bial-...in Radoszyce[?]. This was a village near Lodz. There was a gigantic factory. All the people were taken into this factory.

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:32.312
David Boder: Who?

00:10:32.312 --> 00:10:33.242
Israel Unikowski: The Germans already.

00:10:33.242 --> 00:10:33.668
David Boder: Aha.

00:10:33.668 --> 00:10:59.692
Israel Unikowski: There stood...they were dressed in uniforms. People were [Noise sounds like a plane] horribly beaten. We wanted to get in but we didn’t get in. This was fortunate, because these people...we don’t know what happened to them, to a lot of people from there. We were chased back. In the morning, a man from the Rabbinat rode around. I don’t remember any more what his name was. And he informed us that expulsion has stopped. The expulsion lasted three weeks.

00:10:59.692 --> 00:11:03.876
Israel Unikowski: In a few...A month later began the Ghetto. They began to fence in...

00:11:03.876 --> 00:11:05.154
David Boder: What town was it in? Lodz?

00:11:05.154 --> 00:11:05.832
Israel Unikowski: In Lodz.

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:06.258
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:06.258 --> 00:11:18.710
Israel Unikowski: They began to fence around [word not clear] the whole of Batut[?]. It took in [the area] as far as the Wschodnia[?]. They began to send the Jews into the Ghetto [of Lodz]. We had to...

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:20.589
David Boder: Where were you?

00:11:20.589 --> 00:11:23.669
Israel Unikowski: I was still in Pomorska 19. Because this was a...

00:11:23.669 --> 00:11:24.579
David Boder: Was this in Lodz?

00:11:24.579 --> 00:11:26.342
Israel Unikowski: Yes. Pomor-...that was in the city.

00:11:26.342 --> 00:11:26.826
David Boder: Yes?

00:11:26.826 --> 00:11:30.332
Israel Unikowski: In the center. The Ghetto was in the environs of the city.

00:11:30.332 --> 00:11:30.545
David Boder: Hm.

00:11:30.545 --> 00:11:31.145
Israel Unikowski: In the suburbs.

00:11:31.145 --> 00:11:33.276
David Boder: What did you do all day?

00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:35.174
Israel Unikowski: We studied. We were still children.

00:11:35.174 --> 00:11:35.542
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:35.542 --> 00:11:36.336
Israel Unikowski: We studied.

00:11:36.336 --> 00:11:38.815
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:38.815 --> 00:12:34.830
Israel Unikowski: And on Passover, on the first day of the mid-week an order came out. The Ghetto is being closed. Every Jew who will be encountered in the city...will be...gets the death penalty. In the meantime wires were installed around and around the Ghetto. Every fifty meters stood a German guard. There were large signs: entrance to Jews prohibited. And it was...it was impossible. Everybody—thing in the Ghetto. Some time passed. There were Jews who smuggled food into the Ghetto. Food was still a little easier to get. But this lasted a short time. Soon began the tragic time of the Ghetto. People started to swell up from hunger. A deka...a deka of sugar did cost twenty marks.

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:35.779
David Boder: Twenty mar-...A deka sugar...

00:12:35.779 --> 00:12:36.167
Israel Unikowski: Twenty marks.

00:12:36.167 --> 00:12:36.728
David Boder: . . . cost twenty marks.

00:12:36.728 --> 00:12:37.561
Israel Unikowski: Twenty marks.

00:12:37.561 --> 00:12:39.382
David Boder: How much is a deka of sugar?

00:12:39.382 --> 00:12:40.602
Israel Unikowski: A deka is a hundred grams.

00:12:40.602 --> 00:12:42.868
David Boder: Hundred grams. All right.

00:12:42.868 --> 00:12:43.934
Israel Unikowski: Ten grams. Pardon.

00:12:43.934 --> 00:12:44.283
David Boder: What?

00:12:44.283 --> 00:12:45.464
Israel Unikowski: Ten grams.

00:12:45.464 --> 00:12:46.936
David Boder: A deka is ten grams?

00:12:46.936 --> 00:12:47.711
Israel Unikowski: Ten grams.

00:12:47.711 --> 00:12:48.176
David Boder: Hm.

00:12:48.176 --> 00:12:50.152
Israel Unikowski: A hundred grams is ten deka.

00:12:50.152 --> 00:12:53.135
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:53.135 --> 00:12:59.740
Israel Unikowski: And a bread has cost twelve hundred, thirteen hundred marks.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.076
David Boder: Hm.

00:13:01.076 --> 00:13:11.642
Israel Unikowski: Hospitals were created in the Ghetto, for consumptives. Schools were created in the Ghetto. But this was only in the first years. Nine...

00:13:11.642 --> 00:13:12.107
David Boder: What kind of schools?

00:13:12.107 --> 00:13:13.192
Israel Unikowski: For the children to learn.

00:13:13.192 --> 00:13:14.412
David Boder: For the children to learn?

00:13:14.412 --> 00:13:15.090
Israel Unikowski: Yes.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:15.865
David Boder: Not to pray?[Footnote: The word school has in Yiddish a double connotation: a.) establishment of learning; b.) a house of prayer.]

00:13:15.865 --> 00:13:18.770
Israel Unikowski: And this was only in nineteen forty one. No, to pray at that time was forbidden.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:22.334
David Boder: To pray was forbidden? Why? Nu?

00:13:22.334 --> 00:13:36.236
Israel Unikowski: Because just as the Germans entered, there were huge placards, ‘Every Jew who will be caught praying gets the death penalty.’ There were Jews who were caught praying. They were paraded around town in their praying shawls and phylacteries and they were...they were mocked...and so forth.

00:13:36.236 --> 00:13:39.858
David Boder: Ah. So prayer meetings were not permitted, or what?

00:13:39.858 --> 00:13:42.550
Israel Unikowski: No. This was strictly forbidden.

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.996
David Boder: Yes?

00:13:42.996 --> 00:13:44.236
Israel Unikowski: I remember an instance...

00:13:44.236 --> 00:13:47.374
David Boder: Do you remember how it was phrased in German?

00:13:47.374 --> 00:13:52.681
Israel Unikowski: It was so. The heading of the placard stated: The Fuehrer has set us free.

00:13:52.681 --> 00:13:53.030
David Boder: Yes?

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:55.838
Israel Unikowski: This means they were allowed to do with the Jew anything they wanted.

00:13:55.838 --> 00:13:56.652
David Boder: Yes?

00:13:56.652 --> 00:14:02.982
Israel Unikowski: There were ditches that were dug yet by the Poles in the Polish times against the aeroplanes, during the bombardments.

00:14:02.982 --> 00:14:03.428
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:03.428 --> 00:14:20.757
Israel Unikowski: Jews were caught to work, and these [ditches] the Jews had to fill in with their [bare] hands. I remember, Jews were caught praying during Yom Kippur [Day of Atonement]. They were taken out dressed in their shrouds [cassocks] and praying shawls, and they had to fill in the ditches. A fourteen year old youth passed by, a Hitler youth.

00:14:20.757 --> 00:14:21.997
David Boder: To do what?

00:14:21.997 --> 00:14:23.585
Israel Unikowski: With the [bare] hands they had to fill them in.

00:14:23.585 --> 00:14:24.030
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:28.252
Israel Unikowski: . . . A fourteen year old youth passed by, a Hitler youth.

00:14:28.252 --> 00:14:28.756
David Boder: Hm.

00:14:28.756 --> 00:14:31.758
Israel Unikowski: He took a bayonet, a stiletto,...

00:14:31.758 --> 00:14:32.068
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:32.068 --> 00:14:35.612
Israel Unikowski: . . . and he cut off the beard of a Jew, an old Jew, with the stiletto.

00:14:35.612 --> 00:14:37.839
David Boder: Hm.

00:14:37.839 --> 00:14:46.055
Israel Unikowski: It became steadily worse and worse. I was still then in an orphanage. This was...

00:14:46.055 --> 00:14:46.772
David Boder: In the Ghetto?

00:14:46.772 --> 00:14:47.489
Israel Unikowski: In the Ghetto.

00:14:47.489 --> 00:14:48.283
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:48.283 --> 00:14:51.227
Israel Unikowski: It was on Dworska 10.

00:14:51.227 --> 00:14:52.409
David Boder: Yes?

00:14:52.409 --> 00:14:55.353
Israel Unikowski: One can’t say we were treated badly there. Better than in the Ghetto.

00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:55.876
David Boder: Who?

00:14:55.876 --> 00:14:57.232
Israel Unikowski: Rumkowski, the President.

00:14:57.232 --> 00:15:00.000
David Boder: Oh. The...Rumkowski was the Jew from the Council [?].

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.810
Israel Unikowski: Yes. He became the president of the Ghetto of Lodz.

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:04.708
David Boder: Oh. Rumkowski became the president,...

00:15:04.708 --> 00:15:04.885
Israel Unikowski: Yes.

00:15:04.885 --> 00:15:05.850
David Boder: . . . of the whole Ghetto of Lodz?

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:09.131
Israel Unikowski: Ghetto. He wasn’t just president. He was a Kaiser [emperor], one may say.

00:15:09.131 --> 00:15:09.517
David Boder: Hm.

00:15:09.517 --> 00:15:12.589
Israel Unikowski: He had under him a police.

00:15:12.589 --> 00:15:13.088
David Boder: Jewish police?

00:15:13.088 --> 00:15:20.695
Israel Unikowski: Jewish police. A jail, hospitals, schools. His word was as from a dictator. His word was...

00:15:20.695 --> 00:15:22.513
David Boder: How do you spell his name?

00:15:22.513 --> 00:15:24.250
Israel Unikowski: Rumkowski Chaim.

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:27.499
David Boder: [Slowly?] Chaim Rumkowski.

00:15:27.499 --> 00:15:29.156
Israel Unikowski: [Slowly] Rumkowski.

00:15:29.156 --> 00:15:33.354
David Boder: Good. Nu? Go on.

00:15:33.354 --> 00:15:51.974
Israel Unikowski: Us children he treated very well. But the town, that was terrible. One can say that out of a hundred per cent of the Ghetto there was ninety five per cent who hated him terribly. A few times attempts on his life were made. They wanted to kill him.

00:15:51.974 --> 00:15:52.586
David Boder: On whom?

00:15:52.586 --> 00:15:53.857
Israel Unikowski: On that Rumkowski.

00:15:53.857 --> 00:15:54.066
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:54.066 --> 00:15:56.768
Israel Unikowski: But he had with him the German might.

00:15:56.768 --> 00:15:57.138
David Boder: Yes?

00:15:57.138 --> 00:16:09.040
Israel Unikowski: And nothing happened to him. And the worst thing of which he was blamed was this. A lot, a lot of potatoes was brought into the Ghetto.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:09.667
David Boder: A lot of what?

00:16:09.667 --> 00:16:10.761
Israel Unikowski: Potatoes.

00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:11.662
David Boder: Yes?

00:16:11.662 --> 00:16:37.568
Israel Unikowski: And when it was asked of Rumkowski why he doesn’t distribute them, he answered, ‘You have no business to meddle in my affairs. I’ll distribute the potatoes when I want! Frosts came and the potatoes became rotten, and they had to be thrown away. They were buried in chlorine [?] in the earth. And afterward for three years people still searched for potatoes at this spot where they lay buried for three years.

00:16:37.568 --> 00:16:39.482
David Boder: What did they search for [word not clear]?

00:16:39.482 --> 00:16:44.618
Israel Unikowski: Potatoes. It was...Moreover, the people talked themselves into the belief that they taste better this way. Because the water had evaporated from the potatoes.

00:16:44.618 --> 00:16:46.340
David Boder: Hm.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:17:16.604
Israel Unikowski: Like this, time passed in the Ghetto. There began to happen terrible epidemics. The first epidemic in the Ghetto of Lodz was dysentery. People died like flies. They began to organize hospitals. People...began to leave [escape from?] the Ghetto. There was one by the name of Gerthler.

00:17:16.604 --> 00:17:17.489
David Boder: A what?

00:17:17.489 --> 00:17:33.140
Israel Unikowski: A man, Gertler. I believe he is still living today. He is in Germany. He began to take people out of the Ghetto illegally. Illegally and legally. That means the Germans knew about it. It has cost two hundred or three hundred marks per person.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.732
David Boder: Hm.

00:17:34.732 --> 00:18:34.347
Israel Unikowski: He would take them to Warsaw. People began to get out of the Ghetto. Then there came out an order from the German authorities. From this day every German may shoot as many Jews as he wants. That means they were not permitted to enter the Ghetto but if anybody came near to the wire fence, as far as his rifle could reach, he could shoot him. Hundreds and hundreds of people perished in the Ghetto of Lodz in this way. [Pause] The worst thing in the Ghetto was the state of distress. We began to receive very little food. A ration, an allotment for fourteen days consisted in the Ghetto of the following: Three deka of turnips, forty deka of flour, and ten deka of oatflakes, and forty-five deka of sugar. This [the sugar] consisted of twenty deka brown, dark sugar, and twenty-five deka white sugar. This was the ration for fourteen days.

00:18:34.347 --> 00:18:36.535
David Boder: Did you have to buy this, or what?

00:18:36.535 --> 00:19:48.631
Israel Unikowski: No. This come from the supply center. This was organized, one can say, very well. Because in the beginning—this was already afterwards—in the beginning it was much worse. In the beginning a committee was organized in every house [apartment house]. The committee received the allotment for the entire house, and they distributed it to all the people. This was very bad. They stole. But Rumkowski remedied this. It may be considered in favor of Rumkowski that he didn’t permit theft. What does it mean, he didn’t permit theft? Enough was stolen because whoever had a hand and a leg stole. But at least the ration that was allotted to every person, this at least everbody received. It was organized in this way. There was a warehouse. There in this warehouse the allotment of food was received. For example, the street [section] from Podrzeizna to Polska was assigned to the twentieth district-warehouse. There were in the Ghetto forty-three district-warehouses arranged according to streets. And everybody had a card, a card for bread, a card for vegetables, a card for nutrients//meat?/, and so forth. Today, for instance, comes out bread for such and such card numbers. One went to the warehouse, the card was clipped, entered in the book: On this and this day such and such a person has received a bread, and...

00:19:48.631 --> 00:19:50.030
David Boder: Didn’t one pay for it?

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:54.470
Israel Unikowski: One paid for it. Certainly one paid for it. But in the Ghetto we didn’t walk around idle. We worked and earned.

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:55.049
David Boder: Oh.

00:19:55.049 --> 00:19:55.451
Israel Unikowski: For a...

00:19:55.451 --> 00:19:57.301
David Boder: You paid for your food.

00:19:57.301 --> 00:20:02.593
Israel Unikowski: Certainly! Because...in the Ghetto one worked from the age of ten. Children.

00:20:02.593 --> 00:20:04.571
David Boder: Yes. For whom did you work?

00:20:04.571 --> 00:20:06.437
Israel Unikowski: For the Germans, naturally!

00:20:06.437 --> 00:20:06.855
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:06.855 --> 00:20:17.745
Israel Unikowski: But...How did we work? There were organized large factories. One simply can’t imagine the factories that were organized in the Ghetto In the Ghetto...

00:20:17.745 --> 00:20:18.002
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:18.002 --> 00:20:38.491
Israel Unikowski: Nothing went to waste. For instance, I worked in...in a tailor-factory. There came to the Ghetto materials. From the materials we made tunics for the German soldiers. From the scraps of the tunics were made divans [vide infra]. Beautiful divans out of rags, one can say.

00:20:38.491 --> 00:20:39.665
David Boder: Hm.

00:20:39.665 --> 00:20:43.172
Israel Unikowski: The scraps from the divans[?] which were by then thin little bits [of rags]...

00:20:43.172 --> 00:20:44.201
David Boder: What are divans?

00:20:44.201 --> 00:20:45.971
Israel Unikowski: Divans are rugs.

00:20:45.971 --> 00:20:47.612
David Boder: Oh. Rugs.

00:20:47.612 --> 00:20:50.298
Israel Unikowski: Yes. Out of rags. One really cannot believe it.

00:20:50.298 --> 00:20:51.504
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:51.504 --> 00:21:12.940
Israel Unikowski: And the scraps from the carpets, the very small, tiny pieces, entered in a factory that had machines to tear them apart. From this threads were made. From the threads materials were made, materials and so forth. Nothing went to waste. Also in the Ghetto ammunitions were manufactured. There were huge factories! Ordinarily, we didn’t earn too badly. But we...There was in Ghetto Jewish money.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:13.342
David Boder: What?

00:21:13.342 --> 00:21:15.820
Israel Unikowski: Jewish money. German marks prohibited [to us].

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:16.222
David Boder: Yes?

00:21:16.222 --> 00:21:44.911
Israel Unikowski: There was Jewish money in circulation. This money had a Star of David...with a Star of David, signed Rumkowski Chaim, and for this money we could get things. For this money we could buy things in the Ghetto. Naturally, outside of the Ghetto this money was worthless. It was valid only inside the Ghetto. On this money we...we...we lived. The hunger, the need, and the epidemics still were not able to break the Ghetto. The worst things in the Ghetto were the deportations.

00:21:44.911 --> 00:21:45.684
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:45.684 --> 00:21:52.828
Israel Unikowski: It was in nineteen forty-two. They began to send away thousands, thousands of people.

00:21:52.828 --> 00:21:52.925
David Boder: How...

00:21:52.925 --> 00:21:54.566
Israel Unikowski: Where to we didn’t know.

00:21:54.566 --> 00:21:56.561
David Boder: How were they chosen?

00:21:56.561 --> 00:22:02.352
Israel Unikowski: How they were chosen? This is THE question. This is the greatest guilt [crime] of Rumkowski without question [?].

00:22:02.352 --> 00:22:03.205
David Boder: Yes?

00:22:03.205 --> 00:22:07.082
Israel Unikowski: People that were sick, weak and old were taken.

00:22:07.082 --> 00:22:07.677
David Boder: Yes?

00:22:07.677 --> 00:22:09.559
Israel Unikowski: People who couldn’t walk!

00:22:09.559 --> 00:22:10.749
David Boder: Nu.

00:22:10.749 --> 00:22:27.798
Israel Unikowski: Jews didn’t want to believe that people go to their death. Right after this, after forty thousand Jews were deported, there came into the Ghetto thousands and thousands of kilos of radishes, tiny red radishes.

00:22:27.798 --> 00:22:28.763
David Boder: What was that?

00:22:28.763 --> 00:22:29.230
Israel Unikowski: Little...

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:31.354
David Boder: Radishes. Yes.

00:22:31.354 --> 00:22:31.852
Israel Unikowski: I don’t know what they are called in German.

00:22:31.852 --> 00:22:32.528
David Boder: Little radishes.

00:22:32.528 --> 00:22:33.638
Israel Unikowski: Yes. Red ones.

00:22:33.638 --> 00:22:35.037
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:35.037 --> 00:22:56.458
Israel Unikowski: From every radish the leaves were cut off. So people interpreted it in this way. How is it possible to cut the leaves off from so many pounds of radishes? This is what the Ghetto receives. The Germans have to eat too! Nobody could do this but the children and the old people from the Ghetto of Lodz [the deported ones.]. And thus we deceived ourselves with foolish ‘songs’ and made believe that the people don’t go to their death [they obviously are working].

00:22:56.458 --> 00:22:59.229
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:59.229 --> 00:22:59.768
Israel Unikowski: There had passed...

00:22:59.768 --> 00:23:05.082
David Boder: Talk a little more about the deportations. What happened? They came and said what?

00:23:05.082 --> 00:23:08.097
Israel Unikowski: There arrived...was sent a paper...

00:23:08.097 --> 00:23:08.221
David Boder: Well.

00:23:08.221 --> 00:23:15.854
Israel Unikowski: . . . to this and this family. On this and this day you have to report to the general prison on [name not clear] street. And when the man reported,...

00:23:15.854 --> 00:23:17.079
David Boder: Hm.

00:23:17.079 --> 00:23:23.825
Israel Unikowski: . . . nu, then he was sent away. How the deportation was conducted I’ll relate to you later.

00:23:23.825 --> 00:23:25.064
David Boder: Yes. Yes.

00:23:25.064 --> 00:23:31.504
Israel Unikowski: But if he didn’t report, for this Rumkowski had a good remedy. To the store where he received his food rations was sent...

00:23:31.504 --> 00:23:32.110
David Boder: Yes?

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:34.437
Israel Unikowski: . . . a note: ‘such and such a man does not receive any more bread.’

00:23:34.437 --> 00:23:35.098
David Boder: Hm.

00:23:35.098 --> 00:23:40.309
Israel Unikowski: And this man did not receive anything any more to eat! Not the least little thing! And this man was dommed to death!

00:23:40.309 --> 00:23:41.094
David Boder: Hm.

00:23:41.094 --> 00:23:43.765
Israel Unikowski: There were people who went into hiding.

00:23:43.765 --> 00:23:45.059
David Boder: Hm.

00:23:45.059 --> 00:23:54.677
Israel Unikowski: And many times they were found dead! There were cases of murder where people killed one another to take away...There were people who stole from others at night.

00:23:54.677 --> 00:23:57.541
David Boder: Why did they kill one another?

00:23:57.541 --> 00:23:59.799
Israel Unikowski: [Ration] cards they didn’t have. Food they didn’t receive.

00:23:59.799 --> 00:24:00.997
David Boder: Hm.

00:24:00.997 --> 00:24:03.916
Israel Unikowski: To report? People understood. They knew what was in store for them.

00:24:03.916 --> 00:24:04.687
David Boder: Yes.

00:24:04.687 --> 00:24:10.269
Israel Unikowski: There was a case when a girl was killed. She was seen leaving [the store?] with two loaves of bread.

00:24:10.269 --> 00:24:12.155
David Boder: Yes. A Jew did it?

00:24:12.155 --> 00:24:20.215
Israel Unikowski: Yes. Then a Jew followed her and with an iron [bar] he killed them both in the house. The mother was then at work.

00:24:20.215 --> 00:24:21.427
David Boder: The mother was where?

00:24:21.427 --> 00:24:23.052
Israel Unikowski: She was at work then.

00:24:23.052 --> 00:24:25.861
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:24:25.861 --> 00:24:30.101
Israel Unikowski: When the Ghetto was closed there were in Ghetto a hundred and thirty thousand jews.

00:24:30.101 --> 00:24:30.528
David Boder: Yes.

00:24:30.528 --> 00:24:33.185
Israel Unikowski: By ’42 there were in the Ghetto seventy thousand.

00:24:33.185 --> 00:24:34.438
David Boder: Hm.

00:24:34.438 --> 00:24:41.286
Israel Unikowski: Then there began to be sent in people from Vienna, from Berlin, from Cracow, from all...from over Europe.

00:24:41.286 --> 00:24:41.988
David Boder: They were sent in?

00:24:41.988 --> 00:24:43.034
Israel Unikowski: Into the Ghetto.

00:24:43.034 --> 00:24:43.792
David Boder: Yes.

00:24:43.792 --> 00:25:31.349
Israel Unikowski: If there were again too many people, then another deportation began. I remember when the Viennese entered the Ghetto. They came in from [conditions of] utter abundance. There were among them Jews who even had served in the German army. When we asked them why they were sent to the Ghetto they said that the Germans want to protect them from the bombs, because where they are [from], there are severe bombings and here there are no bombings. You know the German Jews! In such a way people were deceived. In short, a field was alloted to them in God’s acre. Thousands and thousands of them died. Because we, the Polish Jews, became adapted to it little by little...It became worse by degrees. And they who entered Gehenna directly from affluence were strewn over the field...

00:25:31.349 --> 00:25:32.368
David Boder: Who were strewn?

00:25:32.368 --> 00:25:33.180
Israel Unikowski: The Viennese.

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:33.442
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:33.442 --> 00:25:37.200
Israel Unikowski: And they were all deported.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.379
David Boder: So this was the deportation in Vienna?

00:25:39.379 --> 00:25:39.875
Israel Unikowski: Yes.

00:25:39.875 --> 00:25:40.508
David Boder: Hm.

00:25:40.508 --> 00:25:51.241
Israel Unikowski: But all this wasn’t yet the worst. The most terrible event in the Ghetto of Lodz happened in the eighth month of ninteen forty-two. This was the stay-in-order [Sperre] blockade.

00:25:51.241 --> 00:25:52.108
David Boder: Yes?

00:25:52.108 --> 00:26:28.128
Israel Unikowski: It happened one day. We didn’t expect anything. We went to work. There appeared placards. ‘Starting tomorrow at a certain hour, it will be forbidden in the Ghetto to walk on the street.’ Everybody understood what was going on. A day later Germans began to enter the Ghetto. This deportation was for children. Rumkowski made a speech, the most infamous speech in the being of the Ghetto.

00:26:28.128 --> 00:26:29.794
David Boder: This deportation was for children only?

00:26:29.794 --> 00:26:30.510
Israel Unikowski: For children.

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:31.501
David Boder: Nu?

00:26:31.501 --> 00:26:45.723
Israel Unikowski: On the square before the fire department he made a speech. He began the speech with these words, ‘Mother, bring your burned offering.’ Then he spoke to the conscience of the mother that the mother should bring and deliver the child.

00:26:45.723 --> 00:26:46.618
David Boder: That he said?

00:26:46.618 --> 00:26:47.830
Israel Unikowski: That he said.

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:49.000
David Boder: Why did he say that?

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.506
Israel Unikowski: Because...Why? He said thus.

00:26:51.506 --> 00:26:51.850
David Boder: Yes?

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:53.901
Israel Unikowski: ‘The Ghetto will not survive...’

00:26:53.901 --> 00:26:54.668
David Boder: Will not survive.

00:26:54.668 --> 00:26:57.572
Israel Unikowski: No. ‘So I want that at least a small part shall survive.’

00:26:57.572 --> 00:26:57.993
David Boder: Yes.

00:26:57.993 --> 00:27:02.356
Israel Unikowski: And who should survive? Naturally his people. These who stood in good graces [had influence, pull] with him.

00:27:02.356 --> 00:27:03.349
David Boder: Yes.

00:27:03.349 --> 00:27:07.878
Israel Unikowski: And...and he urged that the mother should deliver her...their children.

00:27:07.878 --> 00:27:09.428
David Boder: Did he say ‘Mother bring your...’

00:27:09.428 --> 00:27:18.139
Israel Unikowski: ‘Mother, bring your burned offering.’ Naturally, there arose a screaming, wailing. “You lunatic, down from the platform,’ people screamed.

00:27:18.139 --> 00:27:23.299
David Boder: Wait a moment. At first it was ordered not to walk on the street in the Ghetto. And then you were what? Assembled?

00:27:23.299 --> 00:27:25.511
Israel Unikowski: On the same day he held the speech.

00:27:25.511 --> 00:27:28.114
David Boder: For whom, if there was nobody in the street?

00:27:28.114 --> 00:27:30.777
Israel Unikowski: No. The...the...the placards...

00:27:30.777 --> 00:27:31.153
David Boder: Yes?

00:27:31.153 --> 00:27:34.177
Israel Unikowski: The posters said that beginning tomorrow one isn’t permitted to walk in the street [at certain hours].

00:27:34.177 --> 00:27:34.749
David Boder: Aha. Well?

00:27:34.749 --> 00:27:35.968
Israel Unikowski: And on the same day...

00:27:35.968 --> 00:27:36.175
David Boder: Yes.

00:27:36.175 --> 00:27:38.795
Israel Unikowski: It was, I think, yes, in the eighth month on the...

00:27:38.795 --> 00:27:38.966
David Boder: Yes.

00:27:38.966 --> 00:27:40.148
Israel Unikowski: . . . sixth or on the seventh.

00:27:40.148 --> 00:27:40.319
David Boder: Yes.

00:27:40.319 --> 00:27:43.037
Israel Unikowski: I don’t remember exactly. It was about ten days before Rosh Hashona.

00:27:43.037 --> 00:27:45.170
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:49.959
Israel Unikowski: Instantly people began to build bunkers. People began to hide.

00:27:49.959 --> 00:27:52.640
David Boder: What are bunkers?

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:59.282
Israel Unikowski: Bunkers are...[chuckles] people dug holes in the cellars. On the attics...People hid wherever they could.

00:27:59.282 --> 00:28:00.683
David Boder: Oh. This is called bunkers.

00:28:00.683 --> 00:28:00.939
Israel Unikowski: Yes.

00:28:00.939 --> 00:28:02.535
David Boder: Places to hide.

00:28:02.535 --> 00:28:03.205
Israel Unikowski: To hide.

00:28:03.205 --> 00:28:04.448
David Boder: Nu?

00:28:04.448 --> 00:28:08.470
Israel Unikowski: They started to go from house to house searching for children.

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:09.433
David Boder: Searching for children?

00:28:09.433 --> 00:28:10.030
Israel Unikowski: Children.

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:10.956
David Boder: What for?

00:28:10.956 --> 00:28:11.894
Israel Unikowski: For deportation. Germans.

00:28:11.894 --> 00:28:12.479
David Boder: Who made the search?

00:28:12.479 --> 00:28:13.052
Israel Unikowski: Germans.

00:28:13.052 --> 00:28:13.966
David Boder: Oh. Germans made the search.

00:28:13.966 --> 00:28:16.464
Israel Unikowski: Yes. Because the Jewish police, on this occason, didn’t want to co-operate.

00:28:16.464 --> 00:28:19.693
David Boder: Who were called children? From what age?

00:28:19.693 --> 00:28:22.033
Israel Unikowski: children up to fifteen, up to fourteen years.

00:28:22.033 --> 00:28:23.520
David Boder: Aha. And how old were you?

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.995
Israel Unikowski: I was about thirteen years [old].

00:28:24.995 --> 00:28:25.348
David Boder: Oh.

00:28:25.348 --> 00:28:26.506
Israel Unikowski: Or thirteen and a half.

00:28:26.506 --> 00:28:27.542
David Boder: Hm.

00:28:27.542 --> 00:28:42.008
Israel Unikowski: Yes, but what is the thing [the problem]? The Germans were aware that they don’t have too many children, because mothers had hidden them. So they began to take people who in the Ghetto were called derelicts. In the Ghetto a derelict was one who looked bad.

00:28:42.008 --> 00:28:42.995
David Boder: Aha.

00:28:42.995 --> 00:28:47.431
Israel Unikowski: One was swollen at the legs, one looked bad on his face. All these were taken away.

00:28:47.431 --> 00:28:49.929
David Boder: Now then, about children. Did the Germans go around...

00:28:49.929 --> 00:29:08.574
Israel Unikowski: One cannot imagine how the childr...how the people were sent away. They were accompanied by wagons. When they entered a courtyard, they fired from a revolver. ‘Everybody down.’ People came out. They were lined up. The Germans looked them over. The fuehrer was then Hans Bubov. The trial is going on today.

00:29:08.574 --> 00:29:09.001
David Boder: Whose?

00:29:09.001 --> 00:29:11.243
Israel Unikowski: This Hans Bubov who was now caught in Poland, and now is the trial.

00:29:11.243 --> 00:29:11.962
David Boder: Now?

00:29:11.962 --> 00:29:14.168
Israel Unikowski: Yes. Today his trial is going on in Poland.

00:29:14.168 --> 00:29:14.790
David Boder: Oh.

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:16.581
Israel Unikowski: He was the fuehrer of these selections.

00:29:16.581 --> 00:29:18.409
David Boder: What was his name? Hans Bubov?

00:29:18.409 --> 00:29:19.884
Israel Unikowski: Hans...Hans Bukov.

00:29:19.884 --> 00:29:21.017
David Boder: Is he a Pole or a German?

00:29:21.017 --> 00:29:21.687
Israel Unikowski: A German.

00:29:21.687 --> 00:29:25.477
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:29:25.477 --> 00:29:32.458
Israel Unikowski: There began...the...This lasted four days. But the Germans saw that they have too few children.

00:29:32.458 --> 00:29:34.176
David Boder: Yes.

00:29:34.176 --> 00:29:41.296
Israel Unikowski: And Rumkowski, who like always, never refused...

00:29:41.296 --> 00:29:41.881
David Boder: Uh huh.

00:29:41.881 --> 00:29:45.866
Israel Unikowski: . . . took and handed over the orphanages, the orphanage where I was.

00:29:45.866 --> 00:29:48.315
David Boder: Oh. He handed over the orphanages.

00:29:48.315 --> 00:29:52.288
Israel Unikowski: And this is the most infamous deed that Rumkowski has committed.

00:29:52.288 --> 00:29:52.971
David Boder: Yes.

00:29:52.971 --> 00:30:10.728
Israel Unikowski: It was on a Wednesday. We sensed when we arose that something is not good in that day. It was a little chilly. Early in the morning there came to us...At that time there were in the orphanage, in the so-called children’s colony, one thousand two hundred children.

00:30:10.728 --> 00:30:11.739
David Boder: Thousand two hundred children.

00:30:11.739 --> 00:30:12.056
Israel Unikowski: Yes.

00:30:12.056 --> 00:30:13.238
David Boder: From thirty two?

00:30:13.238 --> 00:30:15.395
Israel Unikowski: No. The thirty two came from Lodz [Kalisz].

00:30:15.395 --> 00:30:15.614
David Boder: Yes.

00:30:15.614 --> 00:30:16.552
Israel Unikowski: But this was in the Ghetto.

00:30:16.552 --> 00:30:16.918
David Boder: Yes.

00:30:16.918 --> 00:30:22.877
Israel Unikowski: Because Rumkowski produced [manufactured] enough orphans—the fathers died at the machines, the cutting machines.

00:30:22.877 --> 00:30:24.473
David Boder: Yes.

00:30:24.473 --> 00:30:59.342
Israel Unikowski: In the morning there came to us a messenger, and [he] said that around eleven o’clock we are leaving for the square there and there. And naturally, perish the thought, we won’t be sent away. The German only wants to take a look at us. We should dress nicely and we shouldn’t worry about anything. About ten-thirty we marched out. We went out with joyful faces. We went out with a military [?] step, with an ached, shtain, shelosh, arba [one, tw o, three, four in Hebrew].

00:30:59.342 --> 00:31:01.743
David Boder: What was the simcha [celebration]?

00:31:01.743 --> 00:31:20.312
Israel Unikowski: We didn’t...we ourselves couldn’t imagine. We didn’t know. I can’t understand. We went like this. We knew that we are going to [our] death, whoever leaves! But we marched so contentedly, as if there was no deportation. We went out and thought what will be, will be!

00:31:20.312 --> 00:31:20.751
David Boder: Oh.

00:31:20.751 --> 00:31:25.930
Israel Unikowski: We...Surrender we will not! We shall do anything possible not to go away!

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:26.735
David Boder: Hm.

00:31:26.735 --> 00:31:31.183
Israel Unikowski: We came out on the square and lined up. We waited for an hour.

00:31:31.183 --> 00:31:32.097
David Boder: How many children? About...

00:31:32.097 --> 00:31:32.816
Israel Unikowski: Thousand two hundred.

00:31:32.816 --> 00:31:34.912
David Boder: . . . [thousand] two hundred children.

00:31:34.912 --> 00:32:13.632
Israel Unikowski: Hans Bubov and another German arrived. They began to go out [around]...to go out [around] on the square. He began to look [us] over. He passed through, one, two, three. He came over to a small boy of ten years. ‘Oh, you little one. Do you know what is about to happen to you? You are all going to be shot.’ The boy didn’t answer him anything. He marched through, two, three. He went over to the woman-fuerer of the orphanages, an ex-mistress of Rumkowski.

00:32:13.632 --> 00:32:14.570
David Boder: A what?

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:17.093
Israel Unikowski: A...a beloved girl of his.

00:32:17.093 --> 00:32:17.349
David Boder: Aha.

00:32:17.349 --> 00:32:18.848
Israel Unikowski: She was twenty-two years old.

00:32:18.848 --> 00:32:20.128
David Boder: The leader of the orphanage?

00:32:20.128 --> 00:32:23.504
Israel Unikowski: Yes, a girl twenty-two years old was a leader of one thousand two hundred children.

00:32:23.504 --> 00:32:24.199
David Boder: A girl?

00:32:24.199 --> 00:32:24.967
Israel Unikowski: A girl of twenty-two.

00:32:24.967 --> 00:32:30.024
David Boder: Oh. And you say that she was Rumowski’s what? She was his...

00:32:30.024 --> 00:32:35.992
Israel Unikowski: She wasn’t...Rumowski later married, and she wasn’t his mistress any more, but he thought a great deal of her.

00:32:35.992 --> 00:32:36.297
David Boder: Yes.

00:32:36.297 --> 00:32:41.111
Israel Unikowski: One can’t imagine otherwise. That he would make a girl of twenty-two an overseer over one thousand two hundred children.

00:32:41.111 --> 00:32:42.269
David Boder: Yes.

00:32:42.269 --> 00:32:50.666
Israel Unikowski: He goes over to her. ‘Genia, how many children are there here?’ [that was] Bubov. ‘One thousand two hundred.’ He stands up straight.

00:32:50.666 --> 00:32:51.994
David Boder: Hm.

00:32:51.994 --> 00:33:04.511
Israel Unikowski: He calls over the head of the Jewish police. ‘Look here, if one of them is missing you forfeit your head!’ When he finished saying that, we were surrounded from all sides!

00:33:04.511 --> 00:33:05.035
David Boder: Who?

00:33:05.035 --> 00:33:09.130
Israel Unikowski: Jewish police, fire-fighters, chimney sweepers...

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:09.557
David Boder: Hm.

00:33:09.557 --> 00:33:13.834
Israel Unikowski: . . . whoever wore a hat and a uniform surrounded us, with a triple line [?].

00:33:13.834 --> 00:33:16.272
David Boder: They surrounded you to watch over you?

00:33:16.272 --> 00:33:16.820
Israel Unikowski: Yes.

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:19.038
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:33:19.038 --> 00:33:29.731
Israel Unikowski: It began to get worse. Wagons began to arrive. We began to run away, but it wasn’t possible because there were police around and around.

00:33:29.731 --> 00:33:30.572
David Boder: Jewish police?

00:33:30.572 --> 00:33:31.827
Israel Unikowski: Jewish police.

00:33:31.827 --> 00:33:32.510
David Boder: Yes?

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:39.688
Israel Unikowski: Luckily, it was...we were surrounded from three sides, and on one side there was a parkan [a fence in Polish].

00:33:39.688 --> 00:33:40.041
David Boder: A what?

00:33:40.041 --> 00:33:41.540
Israel Unikowski: A parkan...a plot [a fence, in Yiddish].

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:42.088
David Boder: A zaum [a fence, in German/?

00:33:42.088 --> 00:34:01.053
Israel Unikowski: A zaun. A wooden fence. On the side where the fence was there was no police because one didn’t understand...one didn’t believe that we could get through the fence, because it was very tall. It was, one can say, three, four meters. Over the fence there was some kind of dump of different things, of iron [asen] and so forth, like a factory.

00:34:01.053 --> 00:34:02.333
David Boder: What is asen?

00:34:02.333 --> 00:34:02.881
Israel Unikowski: Eisen [iron].

00:34:02.881 --> 00:34:06.026
David Boder: Iron. Yes. Nu?

00:34:06.026 --> 00:34:16.031
Israel Unikowski: When they surrounded us from three sides, when we saw the wagons arriving, we got together five or six boys, and we ran over to the fence.

00:34:16.031 --> 00:34:19.371
David Boder: And you...you were among the five or six?

00:34:19.371 --> 00:34:29.269
Israel Unikowski: Yes, yes, I was [among] the five or six, and near the...There was a frightful squall on the square, because there were a thousand, two hundred children. Everyone cried. Everyone screamed, so they didn’t notice.

00:34:29.269 --> 00:34:32.145
David Boder: Were there only...only boys, or were there girls, too?

00:34:32.145 --> 00:34:35.277
Israel Unikowski: Boys, girls, children, from four years up...

00:34:35.277 --> 00:34:35.606
David Boder: Hm.

00:34:35.606 --> 00:34:36.240
Israel Unikowski: . . . to around fifteen.

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:40.956
David Boder: And in the orphanage where you have been, among the thirty-two were there only boys, or boys and girls?

00:34:40.956 --> 00:34:42.309
Israel Unikowski: With me there were only boys.

00:34:42.309 --> 00:34:43.004
David Boder: Yes.

00:34:43.004 --> 00:34:46.282
Israel Unikowski: Where I have been it was a religious orphanage.

00:34:46.282 --> 00:34:48.671
David Boder: Yes.

00:34:48.671 --> 00:35:07.923
Israel Unikowski: And so...when we were surrounded, we ran over to the par-...the fence and began to tear away a board. Nobody paid attention to us because there was a frightful squall, [in low voice, excitedly] and we tore it away. We started out, one, two, three, four.

00:35:07.923 --> 00:35:09.422
David Boder: Nu?

00:35:09.422 --> 00:35:27.261
Israel Unikowski: We didn’t hurry. I got out. What happened, how many got out after me, I don’t know. I only know one thing, that when I was quite far, I heard a policeman calling after me, ‘Hey, you, stop.’ Because...I noticed that [the place] was closed from all sides.

00:35:27.261 --> 00:35:29.723
David Boder: Yes?

00:35:29.723 --> 00:35:34.464
Israel Unikowski: I came to the wall of the holy site [cemetary].

00:35:34.464 --> 00:35:35.012
David Boder: Where to?

00:35:35.012 --> 00:35:36.803
Israel Unikowski: The holy site. [In Hebrew] The abode of life [another synonym for cemetery].

00:35:36.803 --> 00:35:37.668
David Boder: What is that?

00:35:37.668 --> 00:35:38.753
Israel Unikowski: That is the cemetery.

00:35:38.753 --> 00:35:41.568
David Boder: Oh. To the Beth-...Beth-Olom [another synonym for cemetery]. Yes? Nu?

00:35:41.568 --> 00:35:46.004
Israel Unikowski: There was a tall wall. But near the wall there was a pile of coal.

00:35:46.004 --> 00:35:46.516
David Boder: Hm.

00:35:46.516 --> 00:35:59.374
Israel Unikowski: I got between the tombstones. There I was saved for the moment.

00:35:59.374 --> 00:36:00.044
David Boder: What?

00:36:00.044 --> 00:36:01.921
Israel Unikowski: There I was saved for the moment.

00:36:01.921 --> 00:36:02.981
David Boder: Hm.

00:36:02.981 --> 00:36:05.809
Israel Unikowski: I heard the screams of the children, at night.

00:36:05.809 --> 00:36:09.453
David Boder: Yes?

00:36:09.453 --> 00:36:14.998
Israel Unikowski: [Pause.] We hid out. In the morning they came and searched on the abode of life. The Germans went around with machine-guns.

00:36:14.998 --> 00:36:15.814
David Boder: Where, on the Beth-Olom?

00:36:15.814 --> 00:36:17.118
Israel Unikowski: On the Beth-Olom.

00:36:17.118 --> 00:36:19.275
David Boder: And where did the other children remain?

00:36:19.275 --> 00:36:21.164
Israel Unikowski: They were sent away.

00:36:21.164 --> 00:36:22.249
David Boder: They were what?

00:36:22.249 --> 00:36:23.212
Israel Unikowski: They were sent away.

00:36:23.212 --> 00:36:23.614
David Boder: Yes.

00:36:23.614 --> 00:36:28.001
Israel Unikowski: We saved ourselves—out of the thousand two-hundred children—a hundred children.

00:36:28.001 --> 00:36:29.110
David Boder: Two-hundred saved themselves?

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:30.024
Israel Unikowski: A hundred.

00:36:30.024 --> 00:36:30.353
David Boder: What?

00:36:30.353 --> 00:36:31.182
Israel Unikowski: A hundred children.

00:36:31.182 --> 00:36:32.413
David Boder: How? They ran away?

00:36:32.413 --> 00:36:36.495
Israel Unikowski: Some were freed, some through connections [political pull].

00:36:36.495 --> 00:36:38.506
David Boder: Oh. Nu?

00:36:38.506 --> 00:36:42.272
Israel Unikowski: Of the rest [the deported], that is self-understood. We later received no more word.

00:36:42.272 --> 00:36:43.381
David Boder: Oh. So?

00:36:43.381 --> 00:36:45.172
Israel Unikowski: A few more days had passed...

00:36:45.172 --> 00:36:48.170
David Boder: And these few days, where were you? On the Beth-Olom?

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:49.048
Israel Unikowski: On the Beth-Olom.

00:36:49.048 --> 00:36:49.621
David Boder: Yes.

00:36:49.621 --> 00:36:54.581
Israel Unikowski: It rained on those days. We were there in the Tahre-chamber.

00:36:54.581 --> 00:36:57.640
David Boder: Oh, you were the four...how many children?

00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:59.334
Israel Unikowski: We were five persons.

00:36:59.334 --> 00:37:00.102
David Boder: Five persons?

00:37:00.102 --> 00:37:01.065
Israel Unikowski: Five persons.

00:37:01.065 --> 00:37:03.210
David Boder: And you were there in the Tahre-chamber, The five persons.

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:03.832
Israel Unikowski: Yes.

00:37:03.832 --> 00:37:05.014
David Boder: What is a Tahre-chamber?

00:37:05.014 --> 00:37:06.891
Israel Unikowski: There were the dead are washed.

00:37:06.891 --> 00:37:07.561
David Boder: Yes.

00:37:07.561 --> 00:37:13.460
Israel Unikowski: There we stayed overnight. The Germans searched these also. We hid in an attic. We saved ourselves.

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:17.372
David Boder: Were there no funerals during the few days on the Beth-Olom?

00:37:17.372 --> 00:37:22.649
Israel Unikowski: No. There were enough dead. But one wasn’t permitted to walk in the street.

00:37:22.649 --> 00:37:22.954
David Boder: Hm.

00:37:22.954 --> 00:37:24.550
Israel Unikowski: So there weren’t any.

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:25.355
David Boder: Yes.

00:37:25.355 --> 00:37:27.488
Israel Unikowski: There was terrible starvation...

00:37:27.488 --> 00:37:27.866
David Boder: Hm.

00:37:27.866 --> 00:37:30.072
Israel Unikowski: . . . during the eight days, because no food was issued.

00:37:30.072 --> 00:37:30.523
David Boder: Hm.

00:37:30.523 --> 00:37:33.509
Israel Unikowski: Thousands and thousands of people perished there. Just in the Ghetto alone.

00:37:33.509 --> 00:37:34.009
David Boder: Yes.

00:37:34.009 --> 00:37:48.519
Israel Unikowski: Besides those who were sent away. Then there were sent out all together around thirty thousand children, sick [people].

00:37:48.519 --> 00:38:23.664
David Boder: [In English] This concludes Spool 17, on Israel Unikowski, and we continue on...[ends abruptly]

00:38:23.664 --> 00:38:46.058
David Boder: [In English] This is Spool 18. Continuation of Spool 17. August 2nd. The interview of Israel Unikowski at Chateau Boucicaut. Simply a continuation of his interview.

00:38:46.058 --> 00:38:51.044
David Boder: [In Yiddish] And so you were there on the Beth-Olom [cemetery]. Nu?

00:38:51.044 --> 00:38:57.247
Israel Unikowski: A few days later the deportation ceased.

00:38:57.247 --> 00:38:57.966
David Boder: Yes?

00:38:57.966 --> 00:39:05.436
Israel Unikowski: It is important to mention the way of action of the police in the Ghetto.

00:39:05.436 --> 00:39:12.264
David Boder: Wait. Let’s go over this again. Tell me what happened to you afterwards. Omit the general stories.

00:39:12.264 --> 00:39:14.665
Israel Unikowski: I think that the ‘general stories’ are more important than my own.

00:39:14.665 --> 00:39:28.985
David Boder: But that was already written about. I want your story. Let us talk it over. So far it [your report] went on very well. True? So then what happened to you? You returned? You will some day write a good book about it. Nu?

00:39:28.985 --> 00:39:31.983
Israel Unikowski: What happened to me happened to every Jew.

00:39:31.983 --> 00:39:37.625
David Boder: Now then let us have it. Where did you go from the Beth-Olom?

00:39:37.625 --> 00:39:42.941
Israel Unikowski: When the...We were there for three days. Later the deportation stopped.

00:39:42.941 --> 00:39:44.367
David Boder: Yes.

00:39:44.367 --> 00:39:51.935
Israel Unikowski: We returned...we returned to where we have been before, to that orphanage. Nobody was there.

00:39:51.935 --> 00:39:58.089
David Boder: Yes?

00:39:58.089 --> 00:40:01.903
Israel Unikowski: So we got together three people, that is, myself and the brother and another boy.

00:40:01.903 --> 00:40:03.707
David Boder: Oh. Your brother was with you?

00:40:03.707 --> 00:40:04.158
Israel Unikowski: Yes.

00:40:04.158 --> 00:40:05.145
David Boder: The older brother?

00:40:05.145 --> 00:40:05.681
Israel Unikowski: Yes.

00:40:05.681 --> 00:40:06.047
David Boder: Yes.

00:40:06.047 --> 00:40:10.398
Israel Unikowski: And we rented a room in the Ghetto, a private lodging.

00:40:10.398 --> 00:40:12.019
David Boder: Yes.

00:40:12.019 --> 00:40:15.419
Israel Unikowski: And we worked. Again we earned.

00:40:15.419 --> 00:40:16.053
David Boder: Yes.

00:40:16.053 --> 00:40:19.477
Israel Unikowski: Life again became calm, like before.

00:40:19.477 --> 00:40:22.207
David Boder: Yes. Did nobody recognize you? Didn’t know that you...

00:40:22.207 --> 00:40:29.454
Israel Unikowski: In the Ghetto it was like this. There was a deportation. They would send away whoever was caught, whoever fell to be a burned offering was sent away.

00:40:29.454 --> 00:40:30.014
David Boder: Yes.

00:40:30.014 --> 00:40:32.855
Israel Unikowski: Whoever remained...a week [?] would pass...he remained.

00:40:32.855 --> 00:40:36.982
David Boder: Hm. And what did you want to tell about the police?

00:40:36.982 --> 00:40:41.801
Israel Unikowski: The...It is important [to notice] how things happened in the Ghetto.

00:40:41.801 --> 00:40:50.506
David Boder: Yes. Well, this was described already. We know it. Nu? And so, you began working. How long did you work? And what did you do?

00:40:50.506 --> 00:40:55.566
Israel Unikowski: I worked then at wooden knick-knacks.

00:40:55.566 --> 00:40:56.229
David Boder: Wooden...

00:40:56.229 --> 00:40:57.133
Israel Unikowski: Wooden knick-knacks.

00:40:57.133 --> 00:40:57.736
David Boder: What is that?

00:40:57.736 --> 00:41:02.284
Israel Unikowski: These are small...small things for...made out of wood.

00:41:02.284 --> 00:41:02.766
David Boder: Yes.

00:41:02.766 --> 00:41:06.049
Israel Unikowski: I worked at a band-saw and there we manufactured toys for the German children.

00:41:06.049 --> 00:41:11.049
David Boder: Oh. Toys for the German children. Nu. And?

00:41:11.049 --> 00:41:13.971
Israel Unikowski: To...until the year forty-four...

00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:14.242
David Boder: Yes.

00:41:14.242 --> 00:41:16.863
Israel Unikowski: . . . things were quiet, because the...

00:41:16.863 --> 00:41:17.194
David Boder: Yes.

00:41:17.194 --> 00:41:19.724
Israel Unikowski: . . . after...after the deportation...

00:41:19.724 --> 00:41:19.875
David Boder: Yes.

00:41:19.875 --> 00:41:20.441
Israel Unikowski: . . . of the children...

00:41:20.441 --> 00:41:21.634
David Boder: Speak a bit clearer [?].

00:41:21.634 --> 00:41:23.098
Israel Unikowski: . . . he came to power.

00:41:23.098 --> 00:41:23.450
David Boder: Who?

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:25.266
Israel Unikowski: Getler. I mentioned him before.

00:41:25.266 --> 00:41:25.863
David Boder: Yes.

00:41:25.863 --> 00:41:28.276
Israel Unikowski: He had a lot of power in the Ghetto.

00:41:28.276 --> 00:41:30.526
David Boder: Was he a Jew?

00:41:30.526 --> 00:41:31.773
Israel Unikowski: Yes, he is a Jew.

00:41:31.773 --> 00:41:36.002
David Boder: What has become of the other one, Rumkowski?

00:41:36.002 --> 00:41:39.309
Israel Unikowski: He was also around, but the other one, Getler, had a lot of power, too.

00:41:39.309 --> 00:41:40.529
David Boder: What was his name, Getler?

00:41:40.529 --> 00:41:41.432
Israel Unikowski: Getler. He is living today.

00:41:41.432 --> 00:41:43.408
David Boder: Getler, yes. Nu?

00:41:43.408 --> 00:41:49.068
Israel Unikowski: There had been sent in a lot of potatoes into the Ghetto. People recovered a little. There passed a few good months.

00:41:49.068 --> 00:41:50.386
David Boder: Yes.

00:41:50.386 --> 00:41:57.047
Israel Unikowski: In nineteen forty-three, no, forty-four, in the beginning, there came [?] again a deportation.

00:41:57.047 --> 00:41:57.510
David Boder: Yes.

00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:05.293
Israel Unikowski: At that time it was already carried out with another system. Every factory had to surrender fifty per cent of the people to be sent away.

00:42:05.293 --> 00:42:05.561
David Boder: Yes.

00:42:05.561 --> 00:42:11.807
Israel Unikowski: Those who...those who worked there.

00:42:11.807 --> 00:42:17.028
David Boder: Yes [pause]. Nu?

00:42:17.028 --> 00:42:18.931
Israel Unikowski: [Pause] And such was the deportation...

00:42:18.931 --> 00:42:19.175
David Boder: Yes.

00:42:19.175 --> 00:42:26.665
Israel Unikowski: . . . because...Beside the deportation there had reigned at that time in the Ghetto terrible epidemics of lung disease.

00:42:26.665 --> 00:42:27.495
David Boder: What kind of disease?

00:42:27.495 --> 00:42:30.032
Israel Unikowski: Long-disease. Suchoty, grozlica.

00:42:30.032 --> 00:42:30.520
David Boder: What is that?

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:31.398
Israel Unikowski: Tuberculosis.

00:42:31.398 --> 00:42:32.789
David Boder: Oh, tuberculosis. Yes?

00:42:32.789 --> 00:42:41.231
Israel Unikowski: Terrible. I can say that in the Ghetto there were, out of a hundred per cent of the people, there were sixty, seventy per cent sick with tubercolosis.

00:42:41.231 --> 00:42:43.427
David Boder: What did you call it before, lung disease?

00:42:43.427 --> 00:42:44.500
Israel Unikowski: Lung...

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:45.281
David Boder: Lung disease.

00:42:45.281 --> 00:42:45.549
Israel Unikowski: Yes.

00:42:45.549 --> 00:42:47.306
David Boder: Yes, Nu?

00:42:47.306 --> 00:43:03.493
Israel Unikowski: Because, from the work, from the bad food...it is...The hospitals were full! At that time my brother, too, became sick. And sure enough he died in the Ghetto.

00:43:03.493 --> 00:43:04.372
David Boder: Died in Ghetto.

00:43:04.372 --> 00:43:04.714
Israel Unikowski: Yes.

00:43:04.714 --> 00:43:05.300
David Boder: Nu?

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:13.010
Israel Unikowski: I came everyday to the hospital. One can’t imagine what a hospital looked like in the Ghetto!

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:13.962
David Boder: Yes?

00:43:13.962 --> 00:43:22.648
Israel Unikowski: Every person knew...that he won’t live through! Because one consolation for the people was that nobody will survive.

00:43:22.648 --> 00:43:25.917
David Boder: Yes. This was consolation? What sort of consolation is this?

00:43:25.917 --> 00:43:37.082
Israel Unikowski: This...the person himself, the one from...he saw [?] that he is in such a bad way, and if one talked with him, he would say, ‘Sure, I will die, but we will all die. One will die a little earlier, one will die a little later.

00:43:37.082 --> 00:43:43.279
David Boder: Yes. Nu? [Pause] Were there doctors in the hospital?

00:43:43.279 --> 00:43:46.402
Israel Unikowski: Doctors there were enough, but there was nothing with which to heal.

00:43:46.402 --> 00:43:46.817
David Boder: Hm.

00:43:46.817 --> 00:43:59.044
Israel Unikowski: There were no injections. When one needed an injection [in Polish], such an injection [in German], calcium was given. It was very expensive. It was impossible to obtain it in the Ghetto.

00:43:59.044 --> 00:44:01.606
David Boder: Hm.

00:44:01.606 --> 00:44:04.095
Israel Unikowski: In addition came also the deportation.

00:44:04.095 --> 00:44:05.730
David Boder: What was the name, Getler?

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:06.486
Israel Unikowski: Yes.

00:44:06.486 --> 00:44:08.658
David Boder: What was his first name?

00:44:08.658 --> 00:44:12.074
Israel Unikowski: I don’t remember any more.

00:44:12.074 --> 00:44:13.757
David Boder: All right.

00:44:13.757 --> 00:44:20.955
Israel Unikowski: The deportation had come. People were being delivered.

00:44:20.955 --> 00:44:22.126
David Boder: And so, fifty per cent of the...

00:44:22.126 --> 00:44:23.736
Israel Unikowski: Fifty per cent from every factory.

00:44:23.736 --> 00:44:23.931
David Boder: Yes.

00:44:23.931 --> 00:44:30.177
Israel Unikowski: First on the lists were the...single persons.

00:44:30.177 --> 00:44:30.519
David Boder: The single persons...

00:44:30.519 --> 00:44:31.324
Israel Unikowski: Who had no family.

00:44:31.324 --> 00:44:32.300
David Boder: Yes.

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:37.863
Israel Unikowski: I at that time was unfortunately also a single person and was also on the list to be sent away.

00:44:37.863 --> 00:44:39.742
David Boder: Your brother had died in the hospital?

00:44:39.742 --> 00:44:40.279
Israel Unikowski: Yes.

00:44:40.279 --> 00:44:41.792
David Boder: Did you bury him.

00:44:41.792 --> 00:44:45.696
Israel Unikowski: Yes. In the Ghetto one was buried normally like before the war.

00:44:45.696 --> 00:44:48.575
David Boder: Was one allowed to say...

00:44:48.575 --> 00:44:49.039
Israel Unikowski: Yes.

00:44:49.039 --> 00:44:49.917
David Boder: El Moleh rachamin [a prayer for the dead].

00:44:49.917 --> 00:44:50.454
Israel Unikowski: Yes.

00:44:50.454 --> 00:44:52.552
David Boder: Yes. You said one was not allowed to pray.

00:44:52.552 --> 00:44:57.188
Israel Unikowski: One was not allowed to pray, but there were no Germans in the Ghetto, not too many.

00:44:57.188 --> 00:44:57.334
David Boder: Yes.

00:44:57.334 --> 00:45:01.457
Israel Unikowski: One was...There were funerals. They took place on the ‘Abode of Life.!

00:45:01.457 --> 00:45:01.872
David Boder: Hm.

00:45:01.872 --> 00:45:03.604
Israel Unikowski: Nobody was there.

00:45:03.604 --> 00:45:05.995
David Boder: Nu?

00:45:05.995 --> 00:45:24.612
Israel Unikowski: And my friend also was on this list, the one who roomed with me in the Ghetto. We began to hide out. We already knew then that under the Germans to be sent away is not one of the simplest things. That we are not going...that we are not going to pick radishes or leaves, but we are really going to [our] death. We began to hide out.

00:45:24.612 --> 00:45:28.760
David Boder: Yes, but didn’t they need there people for work? Why did they take them?

00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:32.078
Israel Unikowski: The Germans needed people only as long as they had use for them!

00:45:32.078 --> 00:45:32.346
David Boder: Yes.

00:45:32.346 --> 00:45:35.444
Israel Unikowski: If it was found that they are not needed, they were sent to death.

00:45:35.444 --> 00:45:37.128
David Boder: Nu.

00:45:37.128 --> 00:45:47.582
Israel Unikowski: We began to hide out. We slept in one attic...from one attic to another attic. Where we slept, there we didn’t stay overnight. [wo man ist geschlofen dort hat man nicht genachtigt]

00:45:47.582 --> 00:45:48.607
David Boder: Hm.

00:45:48.607 --> 00:45:50.876
Israel Unikowski: We were not permitted to stay till morning and so forth. [Ration] cards we didn’t receive.

00:45:50.876 --> 00:45:51.047
David Boder: What?

00:45:51.047 --> 00:45:51.779
Israel Unikowski: To eat.

00:45:51.779 --> 00:45:52.194
David Boder: Oh, to eat.

00:45:52.194 --> 00:46:21.190
Israel Unikowski: We...we didn’t receive, because there had come an order right away to the store not to issue any food. We lived on what we stole from the fields, the leaves from...from radishes and beets [?]. This we cooked, we ate, till this deportation had also ceased. There approached began the deportation of the eighth month, nineteen forty-four. At that time began the general deportation of the Ghetto of Lodz.

00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:24.045
David Boder: Oh.

00:46:24.045 --> 00:46:55.151
Israel Unikowski: They started to send people, five thousand persons a day. It became gradually worse and worse. There was no more order. There was no way out. The Germans surrounded whole streets and took people. I and my friend, and another family with whom we lived there, we hid out, but there had come out an order that our side of the Ghetto has to present itself.

00:46:55.151 --> 00:46:55.981
David Boder: That who?

00:46:55.981 --> 00:46:58.201
Israel Unikowski: The Ghetto was divided in three parts.

00:46:58.201 --> 00:46:58.494
David Boder: Hm.

00:46:58.494 --> 00:47:01.178
Israel Unikowski: To cross from one side to the other side, there was a bridge.

00:47:01.178 --> 00:47:01.324
David Boder: Hm.

00:47:01.324 --> 00:47:02.593
Israel Unikowski: They closed the passage.

00:47:02.593 --> 00:47:03.423
David Boder: Hm.

00:47:03.423 --> 00:47:14.088
Israel Unikowski: The whole side had to go out. A chance to live in the other [part of the] Ghetto I didn’t have. And we reported. We traveled for twenty hours, and we arrived in Birkenau.

00:47:14.088 --> 00:47:14.844
David Boder: Birkenau?

00:47:14.844 --> 00:47:15.576
Israel Unikowski: Birkenau.

00:47:15.576 --> 00:47:16.820
David Boder: What was Birkenau?

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:34.799
Israel Unikowski: Birkenau was the main lager. It was near Auschwitz a few kilometers [away]. We got off the train. There were the Germans right away who divided us. The ones from right went to death and these from left went into the lager.

00:47:34.799 --> 00:47:37.019
David Boder: What did they tell you? How were you divided?

00:47:37.019 --> 00:47:40.605
Israel Unikowski: We got off...we got off the train. The train was surrounded.

00:47:40.605 --> 00:47:40.850
David Boder: Yes.

00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:42.533
Israel Unikowski: There were in the RR-cars...

00:47:42.533 --> 00:47:43.729
David Boder: Yes.

00:47:43.729 --> 00:47:47.023
Israel Unikowski: There arrived a prisoner who was there, a Jew.

00:47:47.023 --> 00:47:48.292
David Boder: Hm.

00:47:48.292 --> 00:47:52.122
Israel Unikowski: He said, ‘Jews, know that now you are going to a life and death decision.’

00:47:52.122 --> 00:47:52.562
David Boder: What?

00:47:52.562 --> 00:47:55.099
Israel Unikowski: To a life and death decision. Who should live and who should die.

00:47:55.099 --> 00:47:55.392
David Boder: Yes?

00:47:55.392 --> 00:48:03.175
Israel Unikowski: But I knew what it means. Then he said, ‘Say that you are older.’ To us he told, to say we are older, to the other ones he said, ‘Say that you are younger.’ He said that to old people.

00:48:03.175 --> 00:48:03.663
David Boder: Hm.

00:48:03.663 --> 00:48:08.689
Israel Unikowski: We started to march in one row. The women were immediately detached. There stood a German. He was half drunk.

00:48:08.689 --> 00:48:09.348
David Boder: Yes?

00:48:09.348 --> 00:48:19.968
Israel Unikowski: ‘You here and you here’ One he sent here, one he sent there. There were Germans who immediately separated [them]. We didn’t know where the others are going. Later we found out that they went to death.

00:48:19.968 --> 00:48:21.139
David Boder: Hm.

00:48:21.139 --> 00:48:27.141
Israel Unikowski: And I and my friend went to the lager. In Birkenau we were twelve days.

00:48:27.141 --> 00:48:30.118
David Boder: Yes.

00:48:30.118 --> 00:48:37.242
Israel Unikowski: SS men arrived. One bega-...They came over to us and took out...there were about six thousand juveniles [adolescents].

00:48:37.242 --> 00:48:37.925
David Boder: Hm.

00:48:37.925 --> 00:49:10.907
Israel Unikowski: Hungarians, Polish, Czechs. They selected a hundred, two hundred and thirty-two persons. We were divided. It was said that we are going to an estate to work. It is interesting how we were selected. They watched that a brother should not remain with a brother, or an acquaintance with an acquaintance. We were taken into a barrack, told to undress the way the mother had born us, and if one had the smallest spot on the body, he was immediately sent back.

00:49:10.907 --> 00:49:12.001
David Boder: Hm.

00:49:12.001 --> 00:49:15.646
Israel Unikowski: Then they chased us[?]. Suddenly they stopped us.

00:49:15.646 --> 00:49:17.769
David Boder: Hm.

00:49:17.769 --> 00:49:32.369
Israel Unikowski: This one here, this one here and this one here. I was chosen for a house. It was eight kilometers from Auschwitz. It was called Budy. There we were...we worked. I worked in a cattle barn. One took care of horses. This was an estate for the SS men.

00:49:32.369 --> 00:49:33.199
David Boder: An estate for SS men.

00:49:33.199 --> 00:49:34.053
Israel Unikowski: For SS.

00:49:34.053 --> 00:49:35.663
David Boder: Hm, a farm belonging to the SS men.

00:49:35.663 --> 00:49:47.434
Israel Unikowski: Yes. There we weren’t badly fed, but one was beaten a lot. There I was six months till the evacuation came. The Russians began approaching.

00:49:47.434 --> 00:49:50.435
David Boder: Hm. And when were you tatooed?

00:49:50.435 --> 00:49:52.875
Israel Unikowski: Still in Birkenau, before I went to Budy.

00:49:52.875 --> 00:49:59.904
David Boder: [In English] Aha. He carries a tattoo from Auschwitz. Tattoo B7687.

00:49:59.904 --> 00:50:03.426
David Boder: [In Yiddish] Nu? What were you told when you were being tattooed?

00:50:03.426 --> 00:50:13.039
Israel Unikowski: They didn’t tell us anything. When we were looked over [by] doctors and again doctors and again, a few times, we were arranged in one row, in a queue [?], and we were given numbers.

00:50:13.039 --> 00:50:17.284
David Boder: Yes? How was it done? With what were the numbers made?

00:50:17.284 --> 00:50:23.062
Israel Unikowski: There was a needle, a sharp needle, dipped in ink. They painted, with somthing, the skin and pricked thus.

00:50:23.062 --> 00:50:24.714
David Boder: Did it hurt?

00:50:24.714 --> 00:50:31.423
Israel Unikowski: It hurt a little, according to the individual. Some fainted, some...some...It didn’t hurt me so much. It swelled up a little, but that went away.

00:50:31.423 --> 00:50:34.654
David Boder: Nu, so?

00:50:34.654 --> 00:50:56.282
Israel Unikowski: The Russians began to approach. A night before...and so, the Russians were already very near. They took the whole lager, and half-past three in the afternoon we marched out. We walked on foot a hundred and fifty kilometers. Thousands and thousands of people perished at that time, on the way.

00:50:56.282 --> 00:50:56.672
David Boder: How come?

00:50:56.672 --> 00:51:04.333
Israel Unikowski: People were weak from walking. Whoever lagged behind a few steps, they immediately shot him. They...

00:51:04.333 --> 00:51:06.187
David Boder: Did you see it yourself?

00:51:06.187 --> 00:51:16.750
Israel Unikowski: What a question, whether I saw it? They [?] walked behind me. People wept, ‘I can’t any more!’ If he remained lagging one...one step, ‘Oh you old creature!’ He took off the rifle and shot him on the spot.

00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:17.189
David Boder: Hm.

00:51:17.189 --> 00:51:27.391
Israel Unikowski: The whole road...It snowed. It was winter when we went out. Every ten meters there was a corpse...shot. I remember a women...

00:51:27.391 --> 00:51:27.757
David Boder: Yes.

00:51:27.757 --> 00:51:39.431
Israel Unikowski: . . . from our lager, A Russian, a Russian girl. She carried...she carried a rucksack with bread. She wept to the SS man that she can’t walk any more so he answered...

00:51:39.431 --> 00:51:40.553
David Boder: A rucksack full of bread?

00:51:40.553 --> 00:51:43.456
Israel Unikowski: No! Two, three breads, a small one, a hand ruck-sack.

00:51:43.456 --> 00:51:43.847
David Boder: Yes.

00:51:43.847 --> 00:51:50.901
Israel Unikowski: So he asked...so he told her, ‘Throw away the bread.’ So she says, ‘But that is bread.’ He took off the rifle and shot her.

00:51:50.901 --> 00:51:51.462
David Boder: Hm.

00:51:51.462 --> 00:51:54.536
Israel Unikowski: For nothing. She was still able to walk. She was quite healthy. People...

00:51:54.536 --> 00:51:56.488
David Boder: What happened to the bread?

00:51:56.488 --> 00:51:57.586
Israel Unikowski: It was left lying.

00:51:57.586 --> 00:51:57.806
David Boder: Hm.

00:51:57.806 --> 00:52:00.709
Israel Unikowski: With dogs they followed...surrounded by dogs.

00:52:00.709 --> 00:52:07.809
David Boder: Yes. Tell me more about the dogs. What were...I keep hearing about dogs. What did the dogs do?

00:52:07.809 --> 00:52:12.973
Israel Unikowski: They were bloodhounds. When one ran away, the dogs were released after him and they would find him.

00:52:12.973 --> 00:52:13.388
David Boder: Uh-huh.

00:52:13.388 --> 00:52:33.430
Israel Unikowski: They were quite well trained dogs. They...we walked a hundred and fifty kilometers, left behind a few thousand dead on the road. We arrived at the German border. There we ‘boarded a train, open RR-cars. These were winter nights. Frost. We travelled three days and three nights till we arrived in Buchenwald.

00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:35.138
David Boder: Oh, to Buchenwald. Nu?

00:52:35.138 --> 00:52:46.958
Israel Unikowski: In Buchenwald there was yet a new pack of troubles. We entered a block. Again we suffered hunger, again deprivations. Again people died.

00:52:46.958 --> 00:52:49.740
David Boder: Did you work in Buchenwald?

00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:56.035
Israel Unikowski: We didn’t work in Buchenwald. People worked, but when we arrived, there were already in Buchenwald so many thousands of people...

00:52:56.035 --> 00:52:56.474
David Boder: Yes?

00:52:56.474 --> 00:52:58.279
Israel Unikowski: . . . that they couldn’t employ the people any more.

00:52:58.279 --> 00:52:58.597
David Boder: Yes?

00:52:58.597 --> 00:53:05.014
Israel Unikowski: One lay on top of another. We were at that time over eighty thousand people. The lager could accomodate only twenty thousand people.

00:53:05.014 --> 00:53:10.016
David Boder: Describe your block, and what you did the whole day and night.

00:53:10.016 --> 00:53:14.920
Israel Unikowski: I was in several blocks. At the beginning I was in the sixty-second...in fifty-sixth.

00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:16.530
David Boder: Hm.

00:53:16.530 --> 00:53:27.740
Israel Unikowski: The morning came. Bread was brought in, a bread weighing a kilo twenty. It was for six people, sometimes for five people. It depended...They gave [?]...

00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:29.765
David Boder: How many deka did one receive?

00:53:29.765 --> 00:53:31.204
Israel Unikowski: Twenty...twenty-two...

00:53:31.204 --> 00:53:33.449
David Boder: Yes. Hm.

00:53:33.449 --> 00:53:39.500
Israel Unikowski: We ate up the portion of bread. Around ten o’clock, or nine-thirty...Later on we used to eat at six...at ten o’clock there was soup.

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:39.793
David Boder: Yes?

00:53:39.793 --> 00:53:48.527
Israel Unikowski: The soup however it happened. Sometimes it was thin, sometimes a little thicker. Sometimes it had a piece of potato, more, sometimes less. When we ate up the soup we walked till next morning at six.

00:53:48.527 --> 00:53:53.361
David Boder: Were there plates? Did everybody have a plate? Or, how did one eat the soup?

00:53:53.361 --> 00:54:02.242
Israel Unikowski: There were plates. Large jars, small plates, large, pots, small pots. One had spoons, the other didn’t have spoons...

00:54:02.242 --> 00:54:02.584
David Boder: Yes?

00:54:02.584 --> 00:54:08.391
Israel Unikowski: . . . however it happened. Later I went over to the sixty-second block, and there [it] was worse yet. There was...

00:54:08.391 --> 00:54:10.173
David Boder: What do you mean ‘you went over’? You were...

00:54:10.173 --> 00:54:10.978
Israel Unikowski: Transferred.

00:54:10.978 --> 00:54:11.222
David Boder: Yes.

00:54:11.222 --> 00:54:29.499
Israel Unikowski: In block sixty-two there was a German a block-fuehrer, a block elder. This German was once an SS man but got into trouble, what kind I don’t know, and he became a block elder. He caused a lot of trouble. In the middle of the night he would sprinkle...sprinkle in the block under...under the...the plank beds!where we lay...

00:54:29.499 --> 00:54:30.036
David Boder: Yes?

00:54:30.036 --> 00:54:39.844
Israel Unikowski: . . . full of soda and lime, and this burned the eyes. He was a terrible criminal.

00:54:39.844 --> 00:54:40.112
David Boder: Yes?

00:54:40.112 --> 00:54:49.407
Israel Unikowski: He is still living today. This Gustav...he did for us a great thing. He arranged that there should be a separate youth block.

00:54:49.407 --> 00:54:50.800
David Boder: Was he a prisoner too?

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:55.802
Israel Unikowski: He was a prisoner. He was a block representative. He is in Germany today. He was already here, in France, too.

00:54:55.802 --> 00:54:57.241
David Boder: Yes?

00:54:57.241 --> 00:55:00.682
Israel Unikowski: And he made it so there should be a youth-block.

00:55:00.682 --> 00:55:02.390
David Boder: Hm.

00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:16.812
Israel Unikowski: We...we came to the youth-block. We were there a thousand two-hundred and later a little more. We didn’t work. We organized in this block theaters.

00:55:16.812 --> 00:55:17.495
David Boder: Theaters?

00:55:17.495 --> 00:55:21.935
Israel Unikowski: In secret from the SS, naturally. One organized lectures.

00:55:21.935 --> 00:55:22.301
David Boder: Yes.

00:55:22.301 --> 00:55:51.741
Israel Unikowski: We organized schools of geography, of grammar. There, one can say, one spent the day very nicely. Besides the hunger, we didn’t feel the terrible conditions of the lager. There had passed a few months. The Allied armies began to approach Buchenwald. They began to send us out. We started again to hide, again to conceal. There began the old stories. Until, one fine day there came the turn of our block.

00:55:51.741 --> 00:55:52.473
David Boder: Came what?

00:55:52.473 --> 00:55:53.668
Israel Unikowski: Our block’s turn.

00:55:53.668 --> 00:55:54.620
David Boder: What for? To be...

00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:55.498
Israel Unikowski: To be sent out.

00:55:55.498 --> 00:55:55.864
David Boder: Yes.

00:55:55.864 --> 00:56:04.208
Israel Unikowski: People are already being taken...We came out on the appell square. From there we were to leave. There was a terrible alarm.

00:56:04.208 --> 00:56:05.916
David Boder: Who made the alarm?

00:56:05.916 --> 00:56:12.723
Israel Unikowski: There were...In this group there were either English or American planes. They flew very near, nearly overhead.

00:56:12.723 --> 00:56:13.040
David Boder: Hm.

00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:24.412
Israel Unikowski: The SS scattered, ran into shelters, and we ran back to the blocks. At night people were sent again. We hid again. Thousands and thousands of people went out on this day. There began...

00:56:24.412 --> 00:56:25.071
David Boder: What do you mean, ‘went out’?

00:56:25.071 --> 00:56:26.803
Israel Unikowski: Sent out from the lager.

00:56:26.803 --> 00:56:27.657
David Boder: Where were they sent?

00:56:27.657 --> 00:56:29.999
Israel Unikowski: Sent away to Dachau...I don’t exactly know where.

00:56:29.999 --> 00:56:30.999
David Boder: Yes.

00:56:30.999 --> 00:56:37.464
Israel Unikowski: To Theresienstadt. Then, on that day our youngest comrades went out.

00:56:37.464 --> 00:56:37.952
David Boder: Hm.

00:56:37.952 --> 00:56:40.489
Israel Unikowski: They are alive today, all those boys. They are in England.

00:56:40.489 --> 00:56:41.050
David Boder: What?

00:56:41.050 --> 00:56:51.036
Israel Unikowski: They are in England, those boys. And...so many thousands of people were sent out. In the lager there remained twenty or eighteen thousand people, out of eighty...

00:56:51.036 --> 00:56:51.915
David Boder: Of the Jews?

00:56:51.915 --> 00:56:53.232
Israel Unikowski: . . . prisoners.

00:56:53.232 --> 00:56:54.477
David Boder: Or altogether?

00:56:54.477 --> 00:56:57.819
Israel Unikowski: No, altogether. Of the Jews there were left only a few...

00:56:57.819 --> 00:56:57.965
David Boder: Yes.

00:56:57.965 --> 00:56:59.819
Israel Unikowski: . . . because Jews wered the first ‘fowl of atonement’ [sacrifices].

00:56:59.819 --> 00:57:00.088
David Boder: Yes.

00:57:00.088 --> 00:57:04.114
Israel Unikowski: Because the first deportation meant all Jewish prisoners step forward.

00:57:04.114 --> 00:57:04.456
David Boder: Yes.

00:57:04.456 --> 00:57:34.306
Israel Unikowski: First were the Jews. And then [?] that night when assembled for evacuation in the morning, we again expected that any minute we would be sent away. Then came the great day of our liberation. Around three-thirty we saw from the...there began...we heard shooting. There was an alarm, a siren. Then we didn’t know whether to rejoice or not to rejoice. We knew that the German is able in the last second to take us out. The lager had been blown up [vide infra].

00:57:34.306 --> 00:57:35.014
David Boder: What was blown...

00:57:35.014 --> 00:57:36.893
Israel Unikowski: Blown up. Mined. [Footnote: He obviously confuses the terms to blow up and to sow mines, to mine. —D.P.B.]

00:57:36.893 --> 00:57:38.137
David Boder: What was mined?

00:57:38.137 --> 00:57:39.138
Israel Unikowski: The lager, all around...

00:57:39.138 --> 00:57:39.480
David Boder: Yes.

00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:40.480
Israel Unikowski: . . . had been mined with bombs.

00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:40.749
David Boder: Hm.

00:57:40.749 --> 00:57:41.579
Israel Unikowski: To blow up.

00:57:41.579 --> 00:57:43.555
David Boder: Hm, it was mined.

00:57:43.555 --> 00:57:44.116
Israel Unikowski: Mined. Yes

00:57:44.116 --> 00:57:45.116
David Boder: Yes.

00:57:45.116 --> 00:57:55.391
Israel Unikowski: I remind myself of, when...yes, later. Because the moment we heard shooting, in one second...on the Germ-...the whole...all around...

00:57:55.391 --> 00:57:55.928
David Boder: Hm.

00:57:55.928 --> 00:58:05.443
Israel Unikowski: . . . from...where there had been the SS watch-towers there were no more SS men. Half an hour later we ran out right away. We tore down wires, and everybody grabbed a rifle and ran to meet them.

00:58:05.443 --> 00:58:06.590
David Boder: Who grabbed the rifle, the Jews?

00:58:06.590 --> 00:58:13.617
Israel Unikowski: Jews, Turks [?], Russians, Poles, all who were in Buchenwald! We grabbed rifles...we...because the towers of the SS all became empty!

00:58:13.617 --> 00:58:14.861
David Boder: And the SS ran away?

00:58:14.861 --> 00:58:20.131
Israel Unikowski: They ran away! We began chasing. We caught many. We brought them back. We beat them. They were...

00:58:20.131 --> 00:58:21.253
David Boder: You didn’t shoot any of them?

00:58:21.253 --> 00:58:22.815
Israel Unikowski: No shooting was done!

00:58:22.815 --> 00:58:23.571
David Boder: Why?

00:58:23.571 --> 00:58:29.232
Israel Unikowski: Why? Because...In the camp there were Germans,...

00:58:29.232 --> 00:58:29.671
David Boder: Yes?

00:58:29.671 --> 00:58:31.476
Israel Unikowski: . . . but they were prisoners, [these] Germans...

00:58:31.476 --> 00:58:31.744
David Boder: Yes?

00:58:31.744 --> 00:58:33.037
Israel Unikowski: . . . political prisoners.

00:58:33.037 --> 00:58:33.305
David Boder: Yes?

00:58:33.305 --> 00:58:39.160
Israel Unikowski: They said no! We are not the ones to shoot. We favor if we catch a prisoner...

00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:39.356
David Boder: Yes?

00:58:39.356 --> 00:58:40.259
Israel Unikowski: . . . to turn him over to the American army.

00:58:40.259 --> 00:58:40.649
David Boder: Hm.

00:58:40.649 --> 00:58:58.560
Israel Unikowski: And they didn’t allow shooting. One can say that...perhaps it is a crime that we didn’t take revenge, but they, the political Germans, were, in the majority, communists, they took care that the lager should be orderly, that means, not to become wild. Cooking was done in a normal way. Everything went...we dug graves [ditches].

00:58:58.560 --> 00:58:59.829
David Boder: Hm.

00:58:59.829 --> 00:59:08.929
Israel Unikowski: We got out and went to meet them. To our great joy in one of the first three tanks that came in first was a Jew, an American soldier.

00:59:08.929 --> 00:59:10.588
David Boder: Do you know his name?

00:59:10.588 --> 00:59:11.540
Israel Unikowski: No. Alas!

00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:13.955
David Boder: Nu?

00:59:13.955 --> 00:59:24.882
Israel Unikowski: There was an American. He gave us right away to eat cakes. We simply couldn’t imagine, a Jew, an American soldier! We were liberated!

00:59:24.882 --> 00:59:27.810
David Boder: Hm.

00:59:27.810 --> 00:59:31.616
Israel Unikowski: The joy, that I can’t picture in words!

00:59:31.616 --> 00:59:31.909
David Boder: Yes.

00:59:31.909 --> 00:59:39.207
Israel Unikowski: How...how we were liberated! Oh yes, half an hour after we were liberated, there came a telephone call to the lager elder.

00:59:39.207 --> 00:59:39.939
David Boder: A prisoner?

00:59:39.939 --> 00:59:55.298
Israel Unikowski: A German. And it came to the bureau of the SS. The lager-commandant, an SS who was over the lager, telephoned to the lager-fuehrer that the lager should be blown up, to set off the mines, to set off the mines.

00:59:55.298 --> 00:59:56.079
David Boder: Yes.

00:59:56.079 --> 00:59:57.787
Israel Unikowski: But it was already too late.

00:59:57.787 --> 00:59:58.104
David Boder: Hm.

00:59:58.104 --> 01:00:03.520
Israel Unikowski: The block...the lager-commandant was already away, the lager-fuehrer. The call already was taken by an inmate.

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:03.813
David Boder: Yes.

01:00:03.813 --> 01:00:13.029
Israel Unikowski: He spoke from...from Weimar. It was eight kilometers from Buchenwald. The lager should be blown up. So the prisoner answered him, yes, everything is in perfect order, but he has to come to Buchenwald.

01:00:13.029 --> 01:00:14.786
David Boder: Yes.

01:00:14.786 --> 01:00:19.909
Israel Unikowski: He didn’t come. I don’t know why. Possibly on the way he found out that the Germans are running away, so...

01:00:19.909 --> 01:00:21.227
David Boder: The prisoner said that he should come?

01:00:21.227 --> 01:00:22.227
Israel Unikowski: That he should come!

01:00:22.227 --> 01:00:22.496
David Boder: Yes.

01:00:22.496 --> 01:00:27.571
Israel Unikowski: He didn’t tell him that the Americans are already here. He told that he has to come because he by himself can’t do it without his knowledge [presence].

01:00:27.571 --> 01:00:28.401
David Boder: Yes.

01:00:28.401 --> 01:00:30.768
Israel Unikowski: The end is...we were liberated.

01:00:30.768 --> 01:00:32.183
David Boder: Nu.

01:00:32.183 --> 01:00:44.921
Israel Unikowski: Food we didn’t lack. We went out from the lager right away. We went into the beautiful quarters of the SS. We were four weeks there in Buchenwald. We didn’t lack anything, chocolate, all good things.

01:00:44.921 --> 01:00:46.238
David Boder: The SS had that?

01:00:46.238 --> 01:00:48.727
Israel Unikowski: No! The American army had delivered all that!

01:00:48.727 --> 01:00:49.191
David Boder: Yes?

01:00:49.191 --> 01:00:51.924
Israel Unikowski: And...

01:00:51.924 --> 01:00:55.998
David Boder: From what day on did the American army begin to feed you, to give food?

01:00:55.998 --> 01:01:12.856
Israel Unikowski: The first days was still a great hunger, because everything was still far away. The tracks were out. Weimar hadn’t yet surrendered. Erfurt wasn’t yet taken. The American ary still consisted of only the first line troops, those first soldiers who came...

01:01:12.856 --> 01:01:13.637
David Boder: Yes.

01:01:13.637 --> 01:01:17.429
Israel Unikowski: . . . but all of this was foolishness [inconsequential]. We knew that we are liberated!

01:01:17.429 --> 01:01:17.721
David Boder: Hm.

01:01:17.721 --> 01:01:28.495
Israel Unikowski: Three days later there began to arrive food and chocolate and all good things. We began to travel. There began to arrive [people] from the UNRRA. People started travelling to France.

01:01:28.495 --> 01:01:30.594
David Boder: Yes.

01:01:30.594 --> 01:01:39.270
Israel Unikowski: People travelled to Germany. Where we passed we did some damage. In everything...in the gardens we broke everything, the houses. We did some...

01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:40.905
David Boder: Who? The...the...

01:01:40.905 --> 01:01:41.637
Israel Unikowski: The boys.

01:01:41.637 --> 01:01:42.027
David Boder: Hm.

01:01:42.027 --> 01:02:12.999
Israel Unikowski: If we found...if we met a German on the road, a young one...we also...we also told him a bit. The important thing is, we arrived in France! We arrived in...France received us very nicely. We passed through towns. Boy scouts lined up. They sang the Marseillaise. [We were] very nicely received. We travelled in first-class RR-cars. We were met with goodies [refreshments], with very good things, and we arrived in [location not clear]. Here we rested a few months.

01:02:12.999 --> 01:02:13.512
David Boder: Where?

01:02:13.512 --> 01:02:14.171
Israel Unikowski: Ecouis.

01:02:14.171 --> 01:02:14.683
David Boder: Ecouis?

01:02:14.683 --> 01:02:19.611
Israel Unikowski: It is ninety-nine kilometers from Paris. A beautiful village, a ‘preventorium.’ We enjoyed ourselves there very much.

01:02:19.611 --> 01:02:20.904
David Boder: What?

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:22.099
Israel Unikowski: We enjoyed ourselves in Ecouis.

01:02:22.099 --> 01:02:23.978
David Boder: You said ‘a beautiful village’ and what?

01:02:23.978 --> 01:02:24.954
Israel Unikowski: A preventorium.

01:02:24.954 --> 01:02:25.881
David Boder: A preventorium?

01:02:25.881 --> 01:02:35.689
Israel Unikowski: Yes. In the beginning we weren’t too satisfied. I don’t know why. We were not able to communicate. Why, it was I don’t know.

01:02:35.689 --> 01:02:36.445
David Boder: Hm.

01:02:36.445 --> 01:02:49.248
Israel Unikowski: The important thing is [that] later on we were well satisfied. We traveled to...to the house where we are now, [name of locality?]. Today we are learning trades, and everything goes in the best order.

01:02:49.248 --> 01:02:49.638
David Boder: Nu?

01:02:49.638 --> 01:02:51.444
Israel Unikowski: We are searching for relatives.

01:02:51.444 --> 01:02:56.104
David Boder: And so, tell me this. You have no relatives?

01:02:56.104 --> 01:02:56.860
Israel Unikowski: No.

01:02:56.860 --> 01:03:00.227
David Boder: You don’t have any uncles, any aunts?

01:03:00.227 --> 01:03:01.057
Israel Unikowski: No.

01:03:01.057 --> 01:03:04.961
David Boder: No. And so, what are you studying now here in the OSE?

01:03:04.961 --> 01:03:06.034
Israel Unikowski: Dental technician.

01:03:06.034 --> 01:03:08.523
David Boder: Dental technician. Has the OSE its own school?

01:03:08.523 --> 01:03:09.914
Israel Unikowski: U-hm [yes]. Its own school.

01:03:09.914 --> 01:03:12.891
David Boder: Its own school. How long will you study?

01:03:12.891 --> 01:03:15.233
Israel Unikowski: I have to study for two years.

01:03:15.233 --> 01:03:20.430
David Boder: Two years. Do you study other things? Do you learn to read, to write?

01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:23.114
Israel Unikowski: We are learning French, a little English.

01:03:23.114 --> 01:03:28.067
David Boder: A little English. How much education did you have altogether? You went away from...

01:03:28.067 --> 01:03:31.727
Israel Unikowski: Not much. Four...four grades.

01:03:31.727 --> 01:03:33.923
David Boder: That you had already in Lodz?

01:03:33.923 --> 01:03:34.826
Israel Unikowski: Yes.

01:03:34.826 --> 01:03:39.291
David Boder: Nu, and where do you plan to live after you become a dental technician?

01:03:39.291 --> 01:03:48.611
Israel Unikowski: What kind of plans can we make? We already saw that thinking about tomorrow won’t do. Today I am here [?]. Today I am there. What will be tomorrow, I don’t know.

01:03:48.611 --> 01:04:09.117
David Boder: Nu, then tell me another thing. Eh...you...If somebody were to ask what...Of course, your best moment was when the American came. That is understood.

01:04:09.117 --> 01:04:11.630
Israel Unikowski: What was the best moment?

01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:17.632
David Boder: Yes. Naturally. Can you tell what was the best moment of the whole time?

01:04:17.632 --> 01:04:27.453
Israel Unikowski: I know only one thing. When I saw the German...the American soldier, when I saw that I was liberated, I didn’t believe it! I didn’t rejoice at all.

01:04:27.453 --> 01:04:29.258
David Boder: You did not believe it.

01:04:29.258 --> 01:04:43.128
Israel Unikowski: We believed [didn’t believe?] We didn’t understand ourselves that we are liberated. People were crazy. One grabbed clothes and tore them. Another...We broke up things. There are no words to picture what went on!

01:04:43.128 --> 01:04:50.106
David Boder: Tell me this. This is what I want. What happened then? When did the SS men leave? Before the Americans arrived?

01:04:50.106 --> 01:04:51.277
Israel Unikowski: A half an hour before

01:04:51.277 --> 01:04:53.692
David Boder: A half an hour before. Did they say that they are leaving?

01:04:53.692 --> 01:04:57.694
Israel Unikowski: How did they say! They left...They ran away. They were only too glad...

01:04:57.694 --> 01:04:58.182
David Boder: Nu?

01:04:58.182 --> 01:05:01.134
Israel Unikowski: We began chasing after them...many prisoners. We caught...

01:05:01.134 --> 01:05:01.329
David Boder: Yes?

01:05:01.329 --> 01:05:02.988
Israel Unikowski: . . . the majority, one can say.

01:05:02.988 --> 01:05:15.613
David Boder: Nu, and then, you took the weapons and then...then came the Americans? All right. Now can you tell me which was the most horrible in your...in your experiences?

01:05:15.613 --> 01:05:23.225
Israel Unikowski: The worst momment was when we got off the train in Birkenau.

01:05:23.225 --> 01:05:24.152
David Boder: Hm.

01:05:24.152 --> 01:05:26.714
Israel Unikowski: We came out from the bath.

01:05:26.714 --> 01:05:27.714
David Boder: From where?

01:05:27.714 --> 01:05:29.007
Israel Unikowski: From the bath where we bathed.

01:05:29.007 --> 01:05:30.276
David Boder: Where you bathed. Yes?

01:05:30.276 --> 01:05:35.326
Israel Unikowski: We passed through a forest towards the tenth lager. There burned a huge fire.

01:05:35.326 --> 01:05:37.156
David Boder: Yes?

01:05:37.156 --> 01:05:38.913
Israel Unikowski: Then was the most terrible moment.

01:05:38.913 --> 01:05:41.816
David Boder: What was the fire?

01:05:41.816 --> 01:05:46.769
Israel Unikowski: This was the fire of those who had gone ‘to the right.’ Of those people.

01:05:46.769 --> 01:05:48.721
David Boder: But they weren’t burned alive?

01:05:48.721 --> 01:05:52.966
Israel Unikowski: Burned, not alive. They had been gassed, and then burned.

01:05:52.966 --> 01:05:56.431
David Boder: Oh, they weren’t [burned] in a crematory. Right...where, in a...?

01:05:56.431 --> 01:06:02.726
Israel Unikowski: At that time, when we arrived, there were gas-chambers, but the burning was done in pits.

01:06:02.726 --> 01:06:03.116
David Boder: Hm.

01:06:03.116 --> 01:06:05.922
Israel Unikowski: Because, there were...there were very many people.

01:06:05.922 --> 01:06:06.800
David Boder: Yes?

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:14.852
Israel Unikowski: They entered the crematory. It said outside ‘Bathing establishment.’ The people themselves didn’t know where they were going. They were given a towel. They were given soap.

01:06:14.852 --> 01:06:15.267
David Boder: Yes?

01:06:15.267 --> 01:06:17.341
Israel Unikowski: And instead of water gas came out!

01:06:17.341 --> 01:06:27.600
David Boder: Hm. And then they were burned in open pits. Tell me one thing I have heard already, people had told me. There was talk about Gypsies.

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:27.844
Israel Unikowski: Yes.

01:06:27.844 --> 01:06:30.942
David Boder: Have you been...Tell me something about the Gypsies.

01:06:30.942 --> 01:06:34.675
Israel Unikowski: When I had arrived in Birkenau the Gypsy-Lager was already no more.

01:06:34.675 --> 01:06:35.456
David Boder: What had happened?

01:06:35.456 --> 01:06:41.238
Israel Unikowski: It was still called Gypsy-Lager, because, there where I had been, there were [before] only Gypsies.

01:06:41.238 --> 01:06:41.604
David Boder: Hm.

01:06:41.604 --> 01:06:52.131
Israel Unikowski: Old ones, young ones, men, but they lived [there?] only for a short time. And one time we heard that they are going away. And they were all, like one, gassed and burned. The lager became free for [occupancy by] the Jews of the Ghetto of Lodz.

01:06:52.131 --> 01:06:53.302
David Boder: Where was that, in Birkenau?

01:06:53.302 --> 01:06:54.327
Israel Unikowski: In Birkenau.

01:06:54.327 --> 01:06:59.060
David Boder: The Gypsies were gassed and burned? How many do you think there had been of them?

01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:02.744
Israel Unikowski: I don’t know exactly because when I came there was already none of them left.

01:07:02.744 --> 01:07:13.004
David Boder: Yes. They were...Now tell me one thing. Were there any poems there, songs?

01:07:13.004 --> 01:07:14.883
Israel Unikowski: In Buchenwald? Very many.

01:07:14.883 --> 01:07:16.859
David Boder: Do you know any?

01:07:16.859 --> 01:07:18.567
Israel Unikowski: Yes, I know them quite well.

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:26.682
David Boder: Sing [one] in a very soft voice, so that only the words should be audible, true? That only the words should be heard. Begin.

01:07:26.682 --> 01:07:27.512
Israel Unikowski: I’ll try.

01:07:27.512 --> 01:07:36.002
David Boder: Yes. In a very soft voice. [Footnote: This song is attributed to the Polish-Jewish song writer Gebuertig. See also the spool (without a number) marked Hénonville Songs, where this song was sung by Guta Frank. See also Geneva songs, Spool 84 and Tradate songs, Spool 105. —D.P.B.]

01:07:36.002 --> 01:08:19.837
Israel Unikowski: [Sings the famous song “Es Brent”] “It burns, brothers, it burns. / Our poor village, alas burns. / Angry winds in the streets [?] / Tear, break, and blow. / The wild flames strengthen themselves / Everything all around already burns. / And you stand around looking on / With folded arms, / And you stand around looking on / While our village burns!

01:08:19.837 --> 01:08:58.976
Israel Unikowski: It burns, little brothers, it burns. / There may come, beware, the moment / That the town together with us / Will disappear all in flames, / Remaining just like after a battle, / All charred, empty walls. / And you stand around looking on / With folded arms. / And you stand around looking on / While our village burns!

01:08:58.976 --> 01:09:35.410
Israel Unikowski: It burns, little [?] brothers, it burns. / Our poor village, alas, burns ! / If your life is dear to you, / Take the buckets and quench the fire. / Quench it with your own blood ! / Prove [?] that you can do it. / Don’t stand, brothers, looking on. / With folded arms ! / Take the buckets [?] and put out the fire, / Because our village burns!”

01:09:35.410 --> 01:09:37.484
David Boder: Nu. Another.

01:09:37.484 --> 01:09:38.436
Israel Unikowski: Another one?

01:09:38.436 --> 01:09:42.315
David Boder: Yes.

01:09:42.315 --> 01:12:54.569
Israel Unikowski: [Sings] “There, deep in a forest, / The barracks grey, / [???] / People were like animals imprisoned, / Torn off from the free world / And sentenced to silence, to silence.”

01:12:54.569 --> 01:12:58.400
David Boder: Very good. Do you know another one?

01:12:58.400 --> 01:12:59.839
Israel Unikowski: I have to think for a moment.

01:12:59.839 --> 01:13:02.303
David Boder: Hm.

01:13:02.303 --> 01:14:10.552
Israel Unikowski: [Sings] ‘Softly, softly, let us be silent.’

01:14:10.552 --> 01:14:51.060
David Boder: This concludes...this concludes Spool 18 of Israel Unikowski. He sang the last three songs in a very low voice and what we hear here, of course, is amplification. We try to work the machine under best possible conditions, but we have no soundproof rooms, and we are working on fifty cycles. Hence we are to see what we are going to obtain when we use that in America.

01:14:51.060 --> 01:15:26.172
David Boder: Nu, I thank you very much. It came out very well, and not written [without notes]. But I want to tell you, write as much as you are able and it will be collected in the future by Jewish academies and organizations that will want all that was written. And it will be very good. Write everything that you remember, all the songs, all the sayings, all the stories, of everything. As soon as you remind yourself of anything, that you had not written down, write it down.

01:15:26.172 --> 01:16:06.096
David Boder: Now, here is a picture. This is a picture, and I want that you should tell me what does this picture remind you of? What does it remind you of? [Aside] This is 9.G.F., 9.G.F. Nu? Anything that comes to your mind. What does it remind you of? [Pause.] Nu? [Pause.]

01:16:06.096 --> 01:16:07.389
Israel Unikowski: I’ll tell you something...

01:16:07.389 --> 01:16:07.950
David Boder: Yes?

01:16:07.950 --> 01:16:10.219
Israel Unikowski: I am not much of an expert in these things.

01:16:10.219 --> 01:16:14.903
David Boder: But, only the story. What story does it remind you of?

01:16:14.903 --> 01:16:15.757
Israel Unikowski: From this picture?

01:16:15.757 --> 01:16:24.394
David Boder: Yes.

01:16:24.394 --> 01:16:27.614
Israel Unikowski: To me it would look like it is a summer home...

01:16:27.614 --> 01:16:31.006
David Boder: Yes?

01:16:31.006 --> 01:16:36.739
Israel Unikowski: . . . and one made a nice sport...

01:16:36.739 --> 01:16:37.691
David Boder: Yes?

01:16:37.691 --> 01:16:42.180
Israel Unikowski: . . . and this girl or a beloved one or a sister is fearing for his life.

01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:43.229
David Boder: Feared what?

01:16:43.229 --> 01:16:44.205
Israel Unikowski: For his life.

01:16:44.205 --> 01:16:45.352
David Boder: Oh.

01:16:45.352 --> 01:16:46.182
Israel Unikowski: Another [?]?

01:16:46.182 --> 01:16:56.234
David Boder: Yes. [Aside] This is 12.M. What is this?

01:16:56.234 --> 01:16:58.430
Israel Unikowski: This looks like a sick person...

01:16:58.430 --> 01:16:59.284
David Boder: Yes?

01:16:59.284 --> 01:17:02.724
Israel Unikowski: . . . is having a vision.

01:17:02.724 --> 01:17:03.944
David Boder: Hm.

01:17:03.944 --> 01:17:12.093
Israel Unikowski: He thinks in his dream or awake...a very sick person...that someone comes to take his soul away.

01:17:12.093 --> 01:17:24.678
David Boder: Hm. And this is number 1. What is this?

01:17:24.678 --> 01:17:27.460
Israel Unikowski: He has a telephone here, he holds the telephone.

01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:32.120
David Boder: Oh. What is this? Number 15.

01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:34.511
Israel Unikowski: Oh, I made a mistake on the last one picture.

01:17:34.511 --> 01:17:36.658
David Boder: What?

01:17:36.658 --> 01:17:39.244
Israel Unikowski: He played on a mandolin...

01:17:39.244 --> 01:17:43.685
David Boder: Yes?

01:17:43.685 --> 01:17:47.369
Israel Unikowski: . . . and was moved by his own melody.

01:17:47.369 --> 01:17:48.321
David Boder: Yes?

01:17:48.321 --> 01:17:50.126
Israel Unikowski: He had...

01:17:50.126 --> 01:18:00.750
David Boder: Yes?

01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:30.816
Israel Unikowski: He played his own melody...
