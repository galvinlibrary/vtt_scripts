David Boder: Yes?

00:02:16.115 --> 00:02:19.014
Marko Moskovitz: And all were deported. And I have remained alone.

00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:23.754
David Boder: Aha. And now, what was your father’s occupation?

00:02:23.754 --> 00:02:26.081

00:02:30.982 --> 00:02:32.057
David Boder: Was that Poland?

00:02:32.057 --> 00:02:36.877
Marko Moskovitz: No. That was Czechoslovakia...in the ‘39th year.

00:02:36.877 --> 00:02:38.611
David Boder: And then what did it become?

00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:40.284
Marko Moskovitz: Then the Hungarians...

00:02:40.284 --> 00:02:40.757
David Boder: Yes?

00:02:40.757 --> 00:02:42.463
Marko Moskovitz: And now the Russians.

00:02:42.463 --> 00:02:43.518

00:02:45.232 --> 00:02:45.448
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:02:45.448 --> 00:02:52.009
David Boder: Tell me, what happened when the Hungarians took your place?

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:56.964
Marko Moskovitz: [They] entered...Two weeks before Pesach they entered.

00:02:56.964 --> 00:02:57.110
David Boder: Yes?

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.035
Marko Moskovitz: In the ‘39th year.

00:02:59.035 --> 00:02:59.553
David Boder: Yes?

00:02:59.553 --> 00:03:07.101
Marko Moskovitz: Then they began to deport the Jews. Not to deport, but to [make them] go to work.

00:03:07.101 --> 00:03:10.101
David Boder: Aha. What does it mean, they were made to go to work? Tell me...

00:03:10.101 --> 00:03:10.583
Marko Moskovitz: And so, to wear...

00:03:10.583 --> 00:03:12.679
David Boder: . . . everything the way it...

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:14.533
Marko Moskovitz: . . . yellow bands.

00:03:14.533 --> 00:03:14.975
David Boder: You have...

00:03:14.975 --> 00:03:19.300
Marko Moskovitz: They began to wear yellow bands. And my father had also...

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.793
David Boder: Had also...

00:03:19.793 --> 00:03:21.913
Marko Moskovitz: Yes, also wore a yellow star.

00:03:21.913 --> 00:03:22.792
David Boder: And you?

00:03:22.792 --> 00:03:23.767
Marko Moskovitz: Not I [?].

00:03:23.767 --> 00:03:24.853
David Boder: Why?

00:03:24.853 --> 00:03:27.708
Marko Moskovitz: I was still...I was still young.

00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:28.356
David Boder: You were still young.

00:03:28.356 --> 00:03:28.793
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:03:28.793 --> 00:03:30.125
David Boder: And the women?

00:03:30.125 --> 00:03:31.296
Marko Moskovitz: The women, too.

00:03:31.296 --> 00:03:31.602
David Boder: The women, too.

00:03:31.602 --> 00:03:33.295
Marko Moskovitz: The women had remained.

00:03:33.295 --> 00:03:33.677
David Boder: Aha.

00:03:33.677 --> 00:03:35.049
Marko Moskovitz: And then they [word not clear].

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.170
David Boder: What does it mean, they had remained?

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.587
Marko Moskovitz: The women were not yet taken.

00:03:38.587 --> 00:03:39.371
David Boder: Aha.

00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:43.421
Marko Moskovitz: And then a ghetto was made.

00:03:43.421 --> 00:03:45.386
David Boder: Yes. Tell please...

00:03:45.386 --> 00:03:47.494
Marko Moskovitz: They started to wear the stars.

00:03:47.494 --> 00:03:51.027
David Boder: Aha. How did they make the ghetto?

00:03:51.027 --> 00:03:52.530
Marko Moskovitz: In Solotvyna [Sighet Ghetto].

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.440
David Boder: Yes, but how was it done? Was it...

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.073
Marko Moskovitz: It was announced that every person must report.

00:03:59.073 --> 00:03:59.626
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:59.626 --> 00:04:04.902
Marko Moskovitz: And then it was ordered that all Jews must go into one street.

00:04:04.902 --> 00:04:05.445
David Boder: Yes?

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:17.365
Marko Moskovitz: They went in. Then they were surrounded by Hungarian gendarmerie. The ghetto was surrrounded. We were four weeks in the ghetto. Then we were transported to Auschwitz.

00:04:17.365 --> 00:04:18.194
David Boder: To Auschwitz?

00:04:18.194 --> 00:04:18.566
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:04:18.566 --> 00:04:20.179
David Boder: What for to Auschwitz?

00:04:20.179 --> 00:04:22.666
Marko Moskovitz: Just so. All Jews to Auschwitz.

00:04:22.666 --> 00:04:23.968
David Boder: Have you, too, been in Auschwitz?

00:04:23.968 --> 00:04:24.616
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:04:24.616 --> 00:04:30.272
David Boder: All right. Now tell me, how did people live in Auschwitz? What happened there?

00:04:30.272 --> 00:04:35.732
Marko Moskovitz: The first day when we arrived I did not know...I was still young [word not clear]...

00:04:35.732 --> 00:04:35.898
David Boder: Why [not]?

00:04:35.898 --> 00:04:39.009
Marko Moskovitz: I was so mixed up in my head [confused].

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:39.431
David Boder: What is that?

00:04:39.431 --> 00:04:45.175
Marko Moskovitz: For three days I did not know anything, whether night or day...

00:04:45.175 --> 00:04:46.240
David Boder: Why did you not know?

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:53.411
Marko Moskovitz: Just so. There was such a smoke from the crematory that one could not know anything.

00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:54.964
David Boder: When you arrived in Auschwitz?

00:04:54.964 --> 00:05:11.863
Marko Moskovitz: Yes. Then it was said, ‘Craftsmen, step forward.’ So I reported as a carpenter. I stepped forward. Then my father said, ‘Why did you step forward? Now you will leave and I will remain here alone.’ I wanted to go back, but I could not go back any more.

00:05:11.863 --> 00:05:13.948
David Boder: Aha. And where was the mother?

00:05:13.948 --> 00:05:17.139
Marko Moskovitz: The mother was already...kaput.

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:17.827
David Boder: When?

00:05:17.827 --> 00:05:19.631
Marko Moskovitz: Then, the same day.

00:05:19.631 --> 00:05:22.802
David Boder: Wait a moment. You were taken to Auschwitz.

00:05:22.802 --> 00:05:23.134
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:05:23.134 --> 00:05:24.395
David Boder: Tell me the whole story.

00:05:24.395 --> 00:05:36.284
Marko Moskovitz: We were taken out of the RR-cars. We were told women separately and children from...up to twelve, thirteen years, fifteen years should go with their mothers.

00:05:36.284 --> 00:05:36.697
David Boder: Yes.

00:05:36.697 --> 00:05:41.454
Marko Moskovitz: And the...the older ones who are able to work should go...

00:05:41.454 --> 00:05:41.926
David Boder: [Word not clear.]

00:05:41.926 --> 00:05:46.080
Marko Moskovitz: Yes. Should go to the other side.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.170
David Boder: And the mother?

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:56.049
Marko Moskovitz: And the mother was already separated, because she had my siblings, my brother of eight and my sister of eleven years.

00:05:56.049 --> 00:05:56.351
David Boder: Yes.

00:05:56.351 --> 00:05:57.713
Marko Moskovitz: They went with the mother.

00:05:57.713 --> 00:05:58.391
David Boder: Aha.

00:05:58.391 --> 00:06:02.084
Marko Moskovitz: And I with my father and another brother went to the other side.

00:06:02.084 --> 00:06:02.517
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:02.517 --> 00:06:15.188
Marko Moskovitz: We were all taken to labor. Then we came into a block. We were told, ‘Craftsmen, step forward.’ My father believed that I will remain in the lager
                        Auschwitz.

00:06:15.188 --> 00:06:15.399
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:18.268
Marko Moskovitz: So I stepped forward, [reported] that I am a carpenter.

00:06:18.268 --> 00:06:18.550
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:25.133
Marko Moskovitz: [When] I stepped forward, I was taken to another block. And then I was transported to Upper Silesia, to Breslau.

00:06:25.133 --> 00:06:28.889
David Boder: Yes. Nu, when have you last seen your mother?

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:37.162
Marko Moskovitz: Since we were taken out of the RR-cars, since then, I have not seen my mother.

00:06:37.162 --> 00:06:39.127
David Boder: And you are certain that she was...

00:06:39.127 --> 00:06:42.127
Marko Moskovitz: Yes. We saw all that, everything.

00:06:42.127 --> 00:06:43.097
David Boder: What did you see?

00:06:43.097 --> 00:06:45.052
Marko Moskovitz: How they were thrown in.

00:06:45.052 --> 00:06:45.821
David Boder: Where?

00:06:45.821 --> 00:06:47.102
Marko Moskovitz: In the crematory.

00:06:47.102 --> 00:06:49.278
David Boder: But they were not thrown in alive.

00:06:49.278 --> 00:07:02.796
Marko Moskovitz: Just so. They were...they were told...When they began to scream...and then we heard that they scream louder. Suddenly the gates of the gas chamber were opened.

00:07:02.796 --> 00:07:05.506
David Boder: Hm.

00:07:05.506 --> 00:07:07.017
Marko Moskovitz: [They] entered. We heard not one word more.

00:07:07.017 --> 00:07:07.962
David Boder: They entered the gas chambers.

00:07:07.962 --> 00:07:14.277
Marko Moskovitz: Yes. And then the sick who could not walk were instantly with the machines...

00:07:14.277 --> 00:07:15.156
David Boder: What machines?

00:07:15.156 --> 00:07:19.759
Marko Moskovitz: From the SS machines [autos? mobile gas chambers?] thrown in, tossed straight in the crematory.

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:20.498
David Boder: Alive?

00:07:20.498 --> 00:07:21.136
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:07:21.136 --> 00:07:22.146
David Boder: The sick.

00:07:22.146 --> 00:07:23.513
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:07:23.513 --> 00:07:26.629
David Boder: How can one...was the crematory so big that one could throw in live people?

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:31.001
Marko Moskovitz: It was...it was forty square kilometers.

00:07:31.001 --> 00:07:31.715
David Boder: What?

00:07:31.715 --> 00:07:35.901
Marko Moskovitz: Forty-kilometers square was the [word not clear].

00:07:35.901 --> 00:07:36.052
David Boder: What...

00:07:36.052 --> 00:07:37.733
Marko Moskovitz: There was a forest.

00:07:37.733 --> 00:07:37.849
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:38.326
Marko Moskovitz: A large forest.

00:07:38.326 --> 00:07:38.668
David Boder: But...

00:07:38.668 --> 00:07:43.195
Marko Moskovitz: There was a...a forest, and in that forest there was a huge pit.

00:07:43.195 --> 00:07:43.456
David Boder: Yes?

00:07:43.456 --> 00:07:47.019
Marko Moskovitz: And in that pit black pitch was always poured.

00:07:47.019 --> 00:07:47.858
David Boder: What?

00:07:47.858 --> 00:07:52.597
Marko Moskovitz: Such a black tar which...which is poured on streets.

00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:53.135
David Boder: Yes, which...

00:07:53.135 --> 00:07:54.396
Marko Moskovitz: This was poured in.

00:07:54.396 --> 00:07:54.658
David Boder: Yes?

00:07:54.658 --> 00:08:01.161
Marko Moskovitz: This was ignited, and this was burning day and night. And the people were being continuously thrown in.

00:08:01.161 --> 00:08:03.051
David Boder: Oh. Thus the dead were...

00:08:03.051 --> 00:08:03.332
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:08:03.332 --> 00:08:03.910
David Boder: . . . burned.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:04.547
Marko Moskovitz: Yes, yes.

00:08:04.547 --> 00:08:05.145
David Boder: But not alive.

00:08:05.145 --> 00:08:10.678
Marko Moskovitz: Dead. Often alive, who still had years, [who] could still live.

00:08:10.678 --> 00:08:12.613
David Boder: Oh. Not in an oven?

00:08:12.613 --> 00:08:27.925
Marko Moskovitz: Ach...the transports which...these were thrown in the oven who were at work. [Those who] were already Mussulmen [people emaciated to the bone], could not work any more, these were brought to Auschwitz, and these were thrown in the gas chamber and into the oven.

00:08:27.925 --> 00:08:28.051
David Boder: Aha.

00:08:28.051 --> 00:08:38.290
Marko Moskovitz: But the first transports could not go...so many...so many...There would arrive a transport of sixty thousand people. It was impossible in the oven, a small oven. It was...

00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:39.285
David Boder: So they could not...

00:08:39.285 --> 00:08:41.675
Marko Moskovitz: They were always thrown into the pit.

00:08:41.675 --> 00:08:42.694
David Boder: A pit?

00:08:42.694 --> 00:08:42.785
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:08:42.785 --> 00:08:43.869
David Boder: And what was being burned in the pit? [Footnote: The interviewer has apparently become confused if not perplexed by the story which was recorded the second day after his arrival. It is one of the early reports, his first face to face contact with eyewitnesses from Auschwitz.]

00:08:43.869 --> 00:08:44.774
Marko Moskovitz: People were...

00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:45.045
David Boder: Yes, but...

00:08:45.045 --> 00:08:48.001
Marko Moskovitz: Wood...wood was put in and tar.

00:08:48.001 --> 00:08:48.886
David Boder: Wood and tar.

00:08:48.886 --> 00:08:50.057
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:08:50.057 --> 00:08:52.230
David Boder: What did you say before, a Mussulman?

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:56.813
Marko Moskovitz: Yes. These Mussulmen, who worked...were working in the lager.

00:08:56.813 --> 00:08:57.090
David Boder: Yes?

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.920
Marko Moskovitz: And they became thin people, just skin and bones.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:01.251
David Boder: Yes.

00:09:01.251 --> 00:09:03.151
Marko Moskovitz: The Germans called them Mussulmen.

00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:03.452
David Boder: Yes?

00:09:03.452 --> 00:09:09.302
Marko Moskovitz: And they were taken to Auschwitz, and they were thrown in the oven.

00:09:09.302 --> 00:09:09.814
David Boder: Hm.

00:09:09.814 --> 00:09:14.593
Marko Moskovitz: But the transports were tossed into pits.

00:09:14.593 --> 00:09:15.844
David Boder: So that was in Auschwitz.

00:09:15.844 --> 00:09:16.100
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:22.040
David Boder: And so did you...And then when you departed...they ordered, ‘Workers, step forward,’ and you left...

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:22.618
Marko Moskovitz: Yes, I left.

00:09:22.618 --> 00:09:24.814
David Boder: What did your father say?

00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:28.335
Marko Moskovitz: The father believed that I will remain in this lager, in Auschwitz.

00:09:28.335 --> 00:09:28.762
David Boder: Aha.

00:09:28.762 --> 00:09:35.421
Marko Moskovitz: It was Birkenau. There in Birkenau [words not clear].

00:09:35.421 --> 00:09:38.708
David Boder: Nu, then you left your father alone.

00:09:38.708 --> 00:09:39.286
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:09:39.286 --> 00:09:39.693
David Boder: And...

00:09:39.693 --> 00:09:42.572
Marko Moskovitz: With the brother. A brother, too, with the father.

00:09:42.572 --> 00:09:44.034
David Boder: How old was the brother?

00:09:44.034 --> 00:09:45.492
Marko Moskovitz: Thirteen years [old].

00:09:45.492 --> 00:09:47.206
David Boder: Oh. So he could not be a worker.

00:09:47.206 --> 00:09:57.554
David Boder: Since home he was used to...he...he was at work since May until August...[correction] until January...

00:09:57.554 --> 00:09:57.790
David Boder: Hm.

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:07.961
Marko Moskovitz: . . . in the year ’45[?]. He was transported from...He was in Buna, in Monowitz. It is in Poland, a large factory, so he [?]...

00:10:07.961 --> 00:10:09.966
David Boder: Had he been taken away from the father?

00:10:09.966 --> 00:10:13.805
David Boder: Yes...no, the brother was together with the father.

00:10:13.805 --> 00:10:15.242
David Boder: And the father was in a factory?

00:10:15.242 --> 00:10:21.109
Marko Moskovitz: Yes, with the brother. He was transported...evacuated. The Russians had arrived.

00:10:21.109 --> 00:10:21.335
David Boder: Yes?

00:10:21.335 --> 00:10:23.340
Marko Moskovitz: They were sent to Gleiwitz.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:23.832
David Boder: Hm.

00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:25.626
Marko Moskovitz: In Gleiwitz. And in Gleiwitz there they were...

00:10:25.626 --> 00:10:33.103
David Boder: Aha. The first lager you arrived at, where you lost your mother, which lager was that?

00:10:33.103 --> 00:10:34.591
Marko Moskovitz: That is Birkenau.

00:10:34.591 --> 00:10:35.275
David Boder: Birkenau.

00:10:35.275 --> 00:10:36.174
Marko Moskovitz: Yes, Birkenau.

00:10:36.174 --> 00:10:38.697
David Boder: And there your mother remained. With whom, with your sister?

00:10:38.697 --> 00:10:42.014
Marko Moskovitz: With the sister and a little brother eight years old.

00:10:42.014 --> 00:10:44.567
David Boder: Aha. They disappeared there.

00:10:44.567 --> 00:10:45.195
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:10:45.195 --> 00:10:46.868
David Boder: And then your father with your brother...

00:10:46.868 --> 00:10:51.193
Marko Moskovitz: The father with the brother left to work in a factory.

00:10:51.193 --> 00:10:51.786
David Boder: To work in a factory.

00:10:51.786 --> 00:10:52.067
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:10:52.067 --> 00:10:53.399
David Boder: In what factory did they work?

00:10:53.399 --> 00:10:54.349
Marko Moskovitz: In Buna.

00:10:54.349 --> 00:10:54.786
David Boder: Buna.

00:10:54.786 --> 00:10:55.218
Marko Moskovitz: Buna.

00:10:55.218 --> 00:10:57.374
David Boder: And how long were they there?

00:10:57.374 --> 00:11:01.326
Marko Moskovitz: They were...May...

00:11:01.326 --> 00:11:02.427
David Boder: Yes. Until?

00:11:02.427 --> 00:11:06.067
Marko Moskovitz: Until January. In January the evacuation began.

00:11:06.067 --> 00:11:06.318
David Boder: Aha.

00:11:06.318 --> 00:11:12.857
Marko Moskovitz: They walked as far as Gleiwitz I (One). In Gleiwitz I (One)...any more I don’t know.

00:11:12.857 --> 00:11:16.983
David Boder: Aha. How do you know where...where they had been? Did you write...

00:11:16.983 --> 00:11:19.550
Marko Moskovitz: There is here a cousin.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.786
David Boder: Oh.

00:11:19.786 --> 00:11:21.490
Marko Moskovitz: He was together with them.

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:23.917
David Boder: Oh. A cousin was together with you...

00:11:23.917 --> 00:11:26.236
Marko Moskovitz: No, he was together with my father.

00:11:26.236 --> 00:11:26.945
David Boder: He was together...

00:11:26.945 --> 00:11:27.071
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:11:27.071 --> 00:11:27.840
David Boder: . . . with your father.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:27.946
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:11:27.946 --> 00:11:28.936
David Boder: And he told you that.

00:11:28.936 --> 00:11:29.876
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:11:29.876 --> 00:11:33.636
David Boder: Yes. Nu, and where did you work?

00:11:33.636 --> 00:11:35.752
Marko Moskovitz: I was working in Upper Silesia.

00:11:35.752 --> 00:11:38.038
David Boder: In Upper Silesia, yes. In what kind of factory did you work?

00:11:38.038 --> 00:11:40.887
Marko Moskovitz: There was a station.

00:11:40.887 --> 00:11:42.186
David Boder: What...

00:11:42.186 --> 00:11:47.159
Marko Moskovitz: Well, a station. We were making a station.

00:11:47.159 --> 00:11:48.154
David Boder: A railway...

00:11:48.154 --> 00:11:48.335
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:11:48.335 --> 00:11:48.646
David Boder: . . . station?

00:11:48.646 --> 00:11:48.716
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:11:48.716 --> 00:11:50.134
David Boder: You were building.

00:11:50.134 --> 00:11:50.304
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:11:50.304 --> 00:11:51.224
David Boder: You are a carpenter.

00:11:51.224 --> 00:11:59.830
Marko Moskovitz: No. Who cared [?]? The carpenters and the jewelers [?], they were all taken to carry cement and...

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:00.162
David Boder: That were...

00:12:00.162 --> 00:12:01.106
Marko Moskovitz: . . . other work.

00:12:01.106 --> 00:12:06.332
David Boder: Yes. Nu, and how were you treated there in the lager?

00:12:06.332 --> 00:12:08.463
Marko Moskovitz: [We] were given a bread for eight people.

00:12:08.463 --> 00:12:08.850
David Boder: Yes?

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:10.925
Marko Moskovitz: The bread weighed a kilo [and] forty [deka].

00:12:10.925 --> 00:12:11.337
David Boder: Yes?

00:12:11.337 --> 00:12:21.131
Marko Moskovitz: And in the morning black coffee, and for dinner clear water [soup?], and in the evening [words not clear].

00:12:21.131 --> 00:12:23.789
David Boder: Aha. Nu, and when someone was sick?

00:12:23.789 --> 00:12:34.055
Marko Moskovitz: Nu, that is of no use. When someone is sick if it healed by itself, good, if not, then one goes to Auschwitz.

00:12:34.055 --> 00:12:35.447
David Boder: And did that happen?

00:12:35.447 --> 00:12:42.201
Marko Moskovitz: Ach...it happened to three quarters of our lager. One quarter remained.

00:12:42.201 --> 00:12:44.116
David Boder: And the others were taken — where to? To Auschwitz?

00:12:44.116 --> 00:12:45.357
David Boder: Yes. Everything to Auschwitz.

00:12:45.357 --> 00:12:46.608
David Boder: And Auschwitz was what?

00:12:46.608 --> 00:12:51.847
Marko Moskovitz: In Auschwitz, there they were burned.

00:12:51.847 --> 00:12:54.455
David Boder: [Pause.] And the...Thus you worked for how long [?]?

00:12:54.455 --> 00:12:57.897
Marko Moskovitz: Yes. Worked until January.

00:12:57.897 --> 00:12:58.380
David Boder: January.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:59.129
Marko Moskovitz: January, yes.

00:12:59.129 --> 00:12:59.616
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:59.616 --> 00:13:04.209
Marko Moskovitz: In January we were evacuated as far as Prague.

00:13:04.209 --> 00:13:04.465
David Boder: Yes?

00:13:04.465 --> 00:13:43.742
Marko Moskovitz: From Prague to Grossrosen. Everything on foot. Then we were packed in RR-cars, a hundred and twenty people in each, for Flossenburg. In Flossenburg I was two months. Then we were [sent] to Offenburg [?]. From Offenburg...from Offenburg I was...we were...we were loaded in RR-cars, because the Americans were already arriving. We were...en route we were shot at. Very few people remained alive. And we got out of the RR-cars. We ran into a forest, the Black Forest, and there we were liberated by the French.

00:13:43.742 --> 00:13:44.702
David Boder: By the French?

00:13:44.702 --> 00:13:45.250
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:48.119
David Boder: Nu, and then where did you go from there?

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:56.374
Marko Moskovitz: From there...I was...I could walk. I was very weak. I had thirty-two kilos. I could not walk.

00:13:56.374 --> 00:13:58.108
David Boder: What do you mean you had thirty-two kilos?

00:13:58.108 --> 00:13:58.987
Marko Moskovitz: Just so. I was so...

00:13:58.987 --> 00:14:00.228
David Boder: You weighed...

00:14:00.228 --> 00:14:01.258
David Boder: . . . thirty-two kilos.

00:14:01.258 --> 00:14:01.816
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:14:01.816 --> 00:14:03.188
David Boder: How tall are you?

00:14:03.188 --> 00:14:04.902
Marko Moskovitz: One meter, seventy [centimeters].

00:14:04.902 --> 00:14:06.284
David Boder: You are one meter, seventy.

00:14:06.284 --> 00:14:06.842
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:14:06.842 --> 00:14:08.184
David Boder: And you weighed thirty-two kilos.

00:14:08.184 --> 00:14:09.968
Marko Moskovitz: Thirty-two kilos, yes.

00:14:09.968 --> 00:14:11.259
David Boder: Nu?

00:14:11.259 --> 00:14:13.636
Marko Moskovitz: And I was three months...

00:14:13.636 --> 00:14:14.294
David Boder: Where?

00:14:14.294 --> 00:14:19.730
Marko Moskovitz: . . . there in that...the name of it is Immendingen, a village , a German village in Bavaria.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:20.212
David Boder: Yes?

00:14:20.212 --> 00:14:21.111
Marko Moskovitz: And then...

00:14:21.111 --> 00:14:23.538
David Boder: Who fed you there?

00:14:23.538 --> 00:14:25.262
Marko Moskovitz: We ourselves. And then...

00:14:25.262 --> 00:14:27.890
David Boder: What does it mean, ‘we ourselves’? Who else was with you?

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:32.386
Marko Moskovitz: Others. There were Russians. There were Poles, various nationalities.

00:14:32.386 --> 00:14:34.065
David Boder: And how did you get food?

00:14:34.065 --> 00:14:40.216
Marko Moskovitz: So. We got into...the Germans had all fled. Then we got in the houses. We found food.

00:14:40.216 --> 00:14:41.869
David Boder: Aha. The Germans had run away?

00:14:41.869 --> 00:14:43.583
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:14:43.583 --> 00:14:45.317
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:14:45.317 --> 00:14:56.457
Marko Moskovitz: And when we went to Regensburg. From Regensburg I went back to Munich. In Munich I remained till the end. Then I went to Italy.

00:14:56.457 --> 00:15:00.362
David Boder: How did you go from Munich to Italy? Were you allowed to go?

00:15:00.362 --> 00:15:02.488
Marko Moskovitz: Yes. There were provided transports.

00:15:02.488 --> 00:15:03.488
David Boder: Who provided you?

00:15:03.488 --> 00:15:05.649
Marko Moskovitz: The Americans permitted us.

00:15:05.649 --> 00:15:07.076
David Boder: To go where, to Italy?

00:15:07.076 --> 00:15:08.930
Marko Moskovitz: To Italy, yes.

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:10.342
David Boder: What? They let you go to Italy.

00:15:10.342 --> 00:15:11.262
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:15:11.262 --> 00:15:13.900
David Boder: What did you say, you wanted to do in Italy?

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:21.206
Marko Moskovitz: Because I was told that I have no one at home. Then...what shall I go home for? So I came to Italy.

00:15:21.206 --> 00:15:23.553
David Boder: Oh. Otherwise you would have gone home?

00:15:23.553 --> 00:15:24.442
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:15:24.442 --> 00:15:24.654
David Boder: Aha.

00:15:24.654 --> 00:15:26.247
Marko Moskovitz: I have no one at home.

00:15:26.247 --> 00:15:29.426
David Boder: How did you get to Italy? Did you take the train?

00:15:29.426 --> 00:15:33.296
Marko Moskovitz: We got a transport, a whole transport.

00:15:33.296 --> 00:15:35.603
David Boder: Were there many...many Jews?

00:15:35.603 --> 00:15:38.402
Marko Moskovitz: Yes. We were two hundred people.

00:15:38.402 --> 00:15:40.136
David Boder: And where did the others go?

00:15:40.136 --> 00:15:51.322
Marko Moskovitz: The others...some went...many found work and remained in Italy. Some went to France. Many have friends in America.

00:15:51.322 --> 00:15:51.749
David Boder: Aha.

00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:53.523

00:15:53.523 --> 00:15:54.443
David Boder: [Words not clear.]

00:15:54.443 --> 00:15:55.684
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:15:55.684 --> 00:15:58.232
David Boder: Tell me, where were you in Italy?

00:15:58.232 --> 00:15:59.624
Marko Moskovitz: In Turin.

00:15:59.624 --> 00:16:03.580
David Boder: In Turin. And where did you eat...

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:05.123
Marko Moskovitz: In an UNRRA camp.

00:16:05.123 --> 00:16:05.741

00:16:06.012 --> 00:16:08.223
David Boder: They supported you?

00:16:08.223 --> 00:16:11.133
Marko Moskovitz: Yes, [they gave us] to eat,, to sleep.

00:16:11.133 --> 00:16:15.228
David Boder: Hm. And then...Why did you come to France?

00:16:15.228 --> 00:16:18.354
Marko Moskovitz: Why? I am still young. I want to learn a trade.

00:16:18.354 --> 00:16:20.841
David Boder: Aha. Could you not learn that in Italy?

00:16:20.841 --> 00:16:23.921
Marko Moskovitz: No. In Italy there are no trade schools [for DPs].

00:16:23.921 --> 00:16:28.504
David Boder: Aha. And who told you to go to France?

00:16:28.504 --> 00:16:31.454
Marko Moskovitz: Others came, so I came too.

00:16:31.454 --> 00:16:34.886
David Boder: Oh. How did you come to France, by train?

00:16:34.886 --> 00:16:35.655
Marko Moskovitz: No.

00:16:35.655 --> 00:16:36.112
David Boder: How then?

00:16:36.112 --> 00:16:38.851
Marko Moskovitz: [Crossed] the Alps.

00:16:38.851 --> 00:16:40.072
David Boder: You crossed the Alps?

00:16:40.072 --> 00:16:41.645
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:16:41.645 --> 00:16:43.037
David Boder: Why?

00:16:43.037 --> 00:16:49.787
Marko Moskovitz: Why? It had to be so. I had no money for the train, so I had to go that way [?].

00:16:49.787 --> 00:16:52.787
David Boder: You crossed the Alps on foot?

00:16:52.787 --> 00:16:53.315
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:16:53.315 --> 00:16:54.938
David Boder: How long did it take?

00:16:54.938 --> 00:16:57.054
Marko Moskovitz: Two days and a night.

00:16:57.054 --> 00:16:58.014
David Boder: To cross the Alps.

00:16:58.014 --> 00:16:58.582
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:16:58.582 --> 00:17:00.989
David Boder: Did the French let you in?

00:17:00.989 --> 00:17:11.851
Marko Moskovitz: Then, when we came into a French village, we ate, slept. We went to a Committee and asked for money. So we embarked and came to Paris.

00:17:11.851 --> 00:17:14.381
David Boder: Did you have an entry visa?

00:17:14.381 --> 00:17:15.285
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:17:15.285 --> 00:17:17.454
David Boder: Oh. Who issued it to you?

00:17:17.454 --> 00:17:19.081
Marko Moskovitz: We came so...

00:17:19.081 --> 00:17:19.714
David Boder: What?

00:17:19.714 --> 00:17:20.859
Marko Moskovitz: No visa.

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:24.654
David Boder: [Chuckle.] You had no visa. How did the French let you in?

00:17:24.654 --> 00:17:35.177
Marko Moskovitz: Good. We said...we told them we are deportees and we have no...no one at home. Where should we go? We want to go to Paris to work.

00:17:35.177 --> 00:17:35.780
David Boder: Aha.

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.256
Marko Moskovitz: To learn a trade.

00:17:37.256 --> 00:17:39.123
David Boder: All right. So then you came to Paris.

00:17:39.123 --> 00:17:39.485
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:17:39.485 --> 00:17:41.081
David Boder: Where did you find the people?

00:17:41.081 --> 00:17:55.281
Marko Moskovitz: I found one man, a Jew. He was in the train. He came with me. So I asked him where I can stay for a few days until I get to know Paris. So he said, ‘I will take you home for two, three days.’

00:17:55.281 --> 00:17:56.004
David Boder: Here?

00:17:56.004 --> 00:17:57.179
Marko Moskovitz: Yes, in Paris.

00:17:57.179 --> 00:17:58.625
David Boder: And?

00:17:58.625 --> 00:18:06.848
Marko Moskovitz: And after staying there two, three days I left for [words not clear]. From [word not clear] I was sent to [word not clear].

00:18:06.848 --> 00:18:07.511
David Boder: Where?

00:18:07.511 --> 00:18:08.415
Marko Moskovitz: [Words not clear.]

00:18:08.415 --> 00:18:09.198
David Boder: Where is that?

00:18:09.198 --> 00:18:10.704
Marko Moskovitz: Near Paris.

00:18:10.704 --> 00:18:12.692
David Boder: Aha. Nu? And then?

00:18:12.692 --> 00:18:13.927
Marko Moskovitz: Then...

00:18:13.927 --> 00:18:14.740
David Boder: Louder.

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:21.728
Marko Moskovitz: There I was given to eat, to sleep. I told them I want to go and learn a trade, so I came here.

00:18:21.728 --> 00:18:25.493
David Boder: Aha. and where did you find your cousin?

00:18:25.493 --> 00:18:28.987
Marko Moskovitz: The cousin? I came together with him from Italy.

00:18:28.987 --> 00:18:30.674
David Boder: But where did you find him?

00:18:30.674 --> 00:18:34.831
Marko Moskovitz: We were yet together in Germany. After the liberation we found each other.

00:18:34.831 --> 00:18:35.825
David Boder: Oh. After the liberation...

00:18:35.825 --> 00:18:36.367
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:18:36.367 --> 00:18:36.879
David Boder: . . . you found each other.

00:18:36.879 --> 00:18:37.090
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:40.032
David Boder: . . . Tell me, how did you find your cousin?

00:18:40.032 --> 00:18:43.064
Marko Moskovitz: I came to Regensburg.

00:18:43.064 --> 00:18:43.446
David Boder: Yes?

00:18:43.446 --> 00:18:51.520
Marko Moskovitz: I was told that he is in Munich. I went to Munich and found him in the armory.

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.052
David Boder: In the armory.

00:18:52.052 --> 00:18:52.946
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:18:52.946 --> 00:18:55.044
David Boder: And is he from your town?

00:18:55.044 --> 00:18:55.908
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:18:55.908 --> 00:18:57.063
David Boder: Had he been together with you...

00:18:57.063 --> 00:18:58.599
Marko Moskovitz: No. With my father.

00:18:58.599 --> 00:19:01.932
David Boder: How did he...He was with your father? How...how...

00:19:01.932 --> 00:19:02.879
Marko Moskovitz: He...so...

00:19:02.879 --> 00:19:04.706
David Boder: Is he the young man who was here with you?

00:19:04.706 --> 00:19:05.309
Marko Moskovitz: Yes, yes.

00:19:05.309 --> 00:19:06.915
David Boder: Yes?

00:19:06.915 --> 00:19:12.592
Marko Moskovitz: He was together with the father. And his father was together with me in Flossenburg.

00:19:12.592 --> 00:19:15.486
David Boder: Aha. Your father was with him together...

00:19:15.486 --> 00:19:16.320
Marko Moskovitz: Yes. And my...

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.967
David Boder: And his father was with you in Flossenburg.

00:19:17.967 --> 00:19:19.694
Marko Moskovitz: Flossenburg.

00:19:19.694 --> 00:19:24.065
David Boder: Aha. Nu, do you have relatives here in Paris?

00:19:24.065 --> 00:19:24.637
Marko Moskovitz: No.

00:19:24.637 --> 00:19:25.521
David Boder: You have none.

00:19:25.521 --> 00:19:28.382
Marko Moskovitz: In America I have, but I don’t know the address.

00:19:28.382 --> 00:19:29.951
David Boder: In what city?

00:19:29.951 --> 00:19:35.975
Marko Moskovitz: I don’t know. I know his name and...and...and...his name.

00:19:35.975 --> 00:19:38.338
David Boder: Did you inquire in the HIAS [Hebrew immigrant Aid Society]?

00:19:38.338 --> 00:19:40.256
Marko Moskovitz: How...To whom?

00:19:40.256 --> 00:19:43.358
David Boder: There is an American committee here in Paris. Did you inquire there?

00:19:43.358 --> 00:19:44.766
Marko Moskovitz: No, no. Not yet.

00:19:44.766 --> 00:19:47.146
David Boder: Well, look them up and talk to them.

00:19:47.146 --> 00:20:00.245
Marko Moskovitz: Because I know before the war we received...every two weeks we received mail. But when we were deported to Auschwitz all the documents were burned, and now I don’t know the address.

00:20:00.245 --> 00:20:00.807
David Boder: Yes, but...

00:20:00.807 --> 00:20:03.156
Marko Moskovitz: I was then too young. I didn’t know...

00:20:03.156 --> 00:20:05.174
David Boder: Yes, but don’t you know in which city he lives?

00:20:05.174 --> 00:20:05.766
Marko Moskovitz: No.

00:20:05.766 --> 00:20:11.503
David Boder: Well, do you know that there is a committee, an American committee, here which searches for relatives?

00:20:11.503 --> 00:20:12.306
Marko Moskovitz: Where, here in Paris?

00:20:12.306 --> 00:20:15.560
David Boder: Here in Paris. Yes. A very fine committee.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.209
Marko Moskovitz: I don’t know the address.

00:20:16.209 --> 00:20:18.890
David Boder: It is called HIAS.

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:19.964
Marko Moskovitz: The HIAS.

00:20:19.964 --> 00:20:20.607
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:20.607 --> 00:20:22.153
Marko Moskovitz: And how long will it take? How long will it take?

00:20:22.153 --> 00:20:44.604
David Boder: Oh, it may take three months, and it may take six months, but they find them usually. This committee is here in Paris. You ask Mr. Bramson. He will get in touch with them. You give them the name and they...

00:20:44.604 --> 00:20:45.237
Marko Moskovitz: My uncle’s name.

00:20:45.237 --> 00:20:47.289
David Boder: . . . put it in the papers...

00:20:47.289 --> 00:20:48.002
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:20:48.002 --> 00:20:51.368
David Boder: and one is usually found. Do you understand?

00:20:51.368 --> 00:20:52.643
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:20:52.643 --> 00:20:57.767
David Boder: And otherwise where do you intend to remain? Where do you want to go when you have learned a trade?

00:20:57.767 --> 00:21:02.912
Marko Moskovitz: Perhaps if I find my...my uncle in America, perhaps I will go there.

00:21:02.912 --> 00:21:03.846
David Boder: And if not?

00:21:03.846 --> 00:21:12.581
Marko Moskovitz: And if not, I don’t have anywhere to go. I must remain in Paris.

00:21:12.581 --> 00:21:24.199
David Boder: [An attempt to give a modified TAT test follows.] All right. I have here a few pictures. I would like you to tell me what is the meaning of these pictures. For instance, what is this?

00:21:24.199 --> 00:21:26.187
Marko Moskovitz: This is a picture.

00:21:26.187 --> 00:21:46.941
David Boder: Yes, but...Describe it. [Pause.] What is it? What do you think it is?

00:21:46.941 --> 00:21:48.317
Marko Moskovitz: This is a woman.

00:21:48.317 --> 00:21:49.428
David Boder: Well, yes, but...

00:21:49.428 --> 00:21:51.175
Marko Moskovitz: A working woman.

00:21:51.175 --> 00:21:52.761
David Boder: Yes?

00:21:52.761 --> 00:21:55.132
Marko Moskovitz: And she is wrapped in thoughts.

00:21:55.132 --> 00:21:55.935
David Boder: She is wrapped in thoughts.

00:21:55.935 --> 00:21:56.497
Marko Moskovitz: Yes.

00:21:56.497 --> 00:21:58.907
David Boder: What do you think she is thinking about?

00:21:58.907 --> 00:22:02.599
Marko Moskovitz: She thinks of her husband or of her children.

00:22:02.599 --> 00:22:14.497
David Boder: Hm. All right. What is this?

00:22:14.497 --> 00:22:16.274
Marko Moskovitz: This happened in a lager.

00:22:16.274 --> 00:22:17.961
David Boder: Yes?

00:22:17.961 --> 00:22:32.899
Marko Moskovitz: One brother [?] would say to the other, ‘Oh, I am sick now, but perhaps you will survive. Tell my father then that I died.’ This would happen in a lager.

00:22:32.899 --> 00:22:40.158
David Boder: What is this? [Aside] 9GF. What is this? [Given by mistake.]

00:22:40.158 --> 00:22:41.995
Marko Moskovitz: This is two ladies.

00:22:41.995 --> 00:22:47.809
David Boder: Yes? Tell me what is happening here.

00:22:47.809 --> 00:22:50.309
Marko Moskovitz: They look like two sisters.

00:22:50.309 --> 00:22:55.670
David Boder: Yes? What had happened?

00:22:55.670 --> 00:23:02.630
Marko Moskovitz: They have, perhaps, after the war [words not clear]...so one to the other...

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:15.577
David Boder: Speak louder. Yes. What is this? [Aside] 15.

00:23:15.577 --> 00:23:16.963
Marko Moskovitz: This is a man.

00:23:16.963 --> 00:23:20.246
David Boder: Yes? And what...

00:23:20.246 --> 00:23:22.957
Marko Moskovitz: He looks like a Mussulman.

00:23:22.957 --> 00:23:26.602
David Boder: Yes? Speak louder. What does he look like?

00:23:26.602 --> 00:23:27.945
Marko Moskovitz: Like a Mussulman.

00:23:27.945 --> 00:23:30.638
David Boder: Ja? What is a Muselmann?

00:23:30.638 --> 00:23:34.011
Marko Moskovitz: A Mussulman is a man [just] skin and bones.

00:23:34.011 --> 00:23:35.939
David Boder: Who called him a Mussulman?

00:23:35.939 --> 00:23:36.632
Marko Moskovitz: What?

00:23:36.632 --> 00:23:38.650
David Boder: Who named him ‘Mussulman’?

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:40.066
Marko Moskovitz: The Germans.

00:23:40.066 --> 00:23:41.873
David Boder: And what did they do with the Mussulmen?

00:23:41.873 --> 00:23:45.819
Marko Moskovitz: They said, ‘You are a Mussulman. You are not to [have no right to] live any more.’

00:23:45.819 --> 00:23:46.783
David Boder: And then?

00:23:46.783 --> 00:23:54.193
Marko Moskovitz: And then he was told, ‘Get up [?], man. You are not to live any more. You go to the crematory.’

00:23:54.193 --> 00:24:00.609
David Boder: Hm. And what is this?

00:24:00.609 --> 00:24:06.874
Marko Moskovitz: This is two women and a man. They are doing farm work.

00:24:06.874 --> 00:24:13.654
David Boder: Yes?

00:24:13.654 --> 00:24:18.895
Marko Moskovitz: This perhaps is happening in America.

00:24:18.895 --> 00:24:30.552
David Boder: Hm. [A long pause.] All right. And what is this?

00:24:30.552 --> 00:24:40.462
Marko Moskovitz: This is a child. Looks at the violin and thinks he can go on playing, because he had been good.

00:24:40.462 --> 00:24:41.214
David Boder: What had he been?

00:24:41.214 --> 00:24:44.256
Marko Moskovitz: He had been good and he can go on playing.

00:24:44.256 --> 00:24:49.801
David Boder: Aha. Nu?

00:24:49.801 --> 00:25:05.328
David Boder: [In English] This concludes the interview with Mark Moskovski on July 30, 1946, a boy of, hm, Czechoslovakia, age 19.
