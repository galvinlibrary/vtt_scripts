00:00:55.873 --> 00:00:57.588
Bronė Skudaikienė: Žemaičių Kalvarija.

00:00:57.588 --> 00:01:00.236
David Boder: Žemaičių Kalvarija? How far is that away from Vilnius?

00:01:00.236 --> 00:01:01.982
Bronė Skudaikienė: From Vilnius? It is about 200 kilometers from Vilnius.

00:01:01.982 --> 00:01:03.586
David Boder: About 200 kilometers?

00:01:03.586 --> 00:01:04.107
Bronė Skudaikienė: Yeah.

00:01:04.107 --> 00:01:05.711
David Boder: And what did you do there?

00:01:05.711 --> 00:01:09.993
Bronė Skudaikienė: I worked as an accountant in a dairy, and my husband was the dairy manager.

00:01:09.993 --> 00:01:13.101
David Boder: Dairy—accountant in a dairy, and the husband dairy...

00:01:13.101 --> 00:01:15.298
Bronė Skudaikienė: Dairy manager.

00:01:15.298 --> 00:01:17.985
David Boder: What kind of qualification did your husband have?

00:01:17.985 --> 00:01:20.723
Bronė Skudaikienė: I....did everything. Everything.

00:01:20.723 --> 00:01:23.281
David Boder: Yeah. Did he go to school, before...

00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:23.952
Bronė Skudaikienė: Yeah.

00:01:23.952 --> 00:01:25.065
David Boder: Had he been an agronomist?

00:01:25.065 --> 00:01:28.074
Bronė Skudaikienė: No, not an agronomist. He did everything in the dairy.

00:01:28.074 --> 00:01:36.048
David Boder: And what was it like? A large estate? Where had this dairy been?

00:01:36.048 --> 00:01:37.162
Bronė Skudaikienė: He did everything.

00:01:37.162 --> 00:01:38.284
David Boder: [In German/English] Ja. Alright...

00:01:38.284 --> 00:01:39.669
David Boder: [In Russian] Well, tell us in Lithuanian then.

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:45.816
David Boder: [In German] So, tell me, just say what happened when the Russians came to Lithuania.

00:01:45.816 --> 00:04:09.998
Bronė Skudaikienė: [In Lithuanian] So, my husband was a milkman. As always, I was working at his dairy house when the Bolsheviks came. My husband enjoyed high trust with the farmers in those parts, and the Bolsheviks did not like that, my Bolshevik...my husband did not go along with the Bolsheviks, and they hated that much. They arrested my husband, arrested him on January 12, 1941. They put him in Telšiai prison, and kept him there until the war with the Germans started. After the war started, every prisoner of the state, my husband included, a total of seventy-three men, were brutally executed in a forest at Rainiai. First of all, their arrest was very atrocious, they were shoved into cars...they started the engines so no one could hear their screams. They were gagged and had their hands tied. Then they took them to the forest, dug out four pits, and brutally executed them. In particular, they were being savagely burned with electrical machines, then they would cook cabbage and put it on their mouths...and...some even had their eyes clawed out...tongues, ears cut off. And then they were all brutally tortured to death. Beaten. The skin of their lips, hands, faces was just boiled away. The entire body was bloodied, and with hands tied, gagged they were slaughtered, and then...piled into the pit and covered with dirt. And then all the Bolsheviks ran from Lithuania. It was after four days that partisans found those pits. It was all very suspicious. And once they uncovered them, they found all the prisoners of state. Then they exhumed them all, laid them out in a field and then all the p—...acquaintances, relatives came, and they were all buried ceremoniously, there has rarely been such a ceremony and such a horrible procession for anyone to see in Telšiai.

00:04:09.998 --> 00:04:15.926
David Boder: [In Russian] And now...now tell me...

00:04:15.926 --> 00:04:23.668
David Boder: [In German] Uh, now tell me please, what happened to you, and how did it happen, when the Germans came to Lithuanaia?

00:04:23.668 --> 00:05:11.536
Bronė Skudaikienė: [In Lithuanian] When the Germans came, it was not very good either, because it was hard for the farmers, because...because they had many duties. They had alot of milk to produce, dairy houses, ba—...meat, and everything. Later, when they saw that the Germans were not doing well, they would catch men and take them away to work in Germany. People would come to the marketplace. So they would surround the marketplace and the local police, the troops, would catch all the men, put them into vehicles and take them to Germany. They would all be taken to work. So husbands were separated from their wives, parents from kids.

00:05:11.536 --> 00:05:14.494
David Boder: [In Russian] How did you get here...

00:05:14.494 --> 00:05:20.401
David Boder: [In German] Which way did you come to Munich? Lithuanian.

00:05:20.401 --> 00:05:29.377
Bronė Skudaikienė: [In Lithuanian] I came to Munich on the twenty-third day of May, 1945.

00:05:29.377 --> 00:05:32.184
David Boder: [In German] Do you have relatives in America?

00:05:32.184 --> 00:05:35.795
Bronė Skudaikienė: [In Lithuanian] I have...There is my mother’s brother and husband’s brother...

00:05:35.795 --> 00:05:37.571
David Boder: [In German] Have you already received an affidavit?

00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:38.423
Bronė Skudaikienė: [In Lithuanian] No.

00:05:38.423 --> 00:05:40.147
David Boder: [In German] Do you want to leave for America?

00:05:40.147 --> 00:05:41.802
Bronė Skudaikienė: [In Lithuanian] At any time, whenever possible.

00:05:41.802 --> 00:05:43.939
David Boder: [In German] Did you write to them? Do you have their address?

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:48.853
Bronė Skudaikienė: [In Lithuanian] I wrote an inquiry to the consul, but did not receive a reply.

00:05:48.853 --> 00:05:51.059
David Boder: [In German] Do you have the address?

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:54.920
Bronė Skudaikienė: No, I sent it to the consulate, in Sofia.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:02.963
David Boder: I see. You sent it to Sofia. And what do you think, how long will you still be here?

00:06:02.963 --> 00:06:05.521
Bronė Skudaikienė: I have no idea.

00:06:05.521 --> 00:06:07.366
David Boder: And what do your children do here?

00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:08.880
Bronė Skudaikienė: They go to school.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.701
David Boder: They go to school?

00:06:09.701 --> 00:06:10.424
Bronė Skudaikienė: Yeah, to school.

00:06:10.424 --> 00:06:11.125
David Boder: A Lithuanian school?

00:06:11.125 --> 00:06:12.359
Bronė Skudaikienė: To a Lithuanian school.

00:06:12.359 --> 00:06:13.632
David Boder: I see, and what do you do yourself?

00:06:13.632 --> 00:06:16.770
Bronė Skudaikienė: I do...I am working as a dress maker.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.516
David Boder: So, are you already dress maker, or are you learning how to be a dress maker?

00:06:18.516 --> 00:06:22.888
Bronė Skudaikienė: No, I have already finished my training. I am working as a dress maker now.

00:06:22.888 --> 00:06:23.821
David Boder: Who do you work for?

00:06:23.821 --> 00:06:25.816
Bronė Skudaikienė: For the tailor of the camp.

00:06:25.816 --> 00:06:37.560
David Boder: For the tailor shop in the camp. Thank you very much, Mrs. Skudaykina. This is really interesting. I am sorry that I am not able to understand everything, but we wrote it all down here and it will be translated.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.035
Bronė Skudaikienė: Yeah, thanks.

00:06:39.035 --> 00:07:04.901
David Boder: [In English] Munich, September the 21st of 1946. This concludes the short interview with B. Skudaykina, who insists on talking only Lithuanian and unfortunately very difficult for me to steer this conversation. It will be necessary that a competent Lithuanian anthropologist or psychologist really come over and really interview these people.

00:07:04.901 --> 00:07:51.145
David Boder: This concluded Spool 9-143A and 9-143B. The last part, 9-143C, the interview with Father Kharchenko, is on a separate spool. This spool contains two interviews, one with Mr. Sevalkaitis or Suvalkaitis, and the other, 9-143B, is Bronė Skudaikienė. Chicago, October the 7th, 1950. Boder.
