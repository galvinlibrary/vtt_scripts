00:00:01.091 --> 00:01:27.153
David Boder: Spool 133. September 20, 1946, Munich at the Funkenkaserne in a displaced persons camp of about 5,000 persons, an immense installation of the former German army which apparently was occupied by the signal corps. Though the windows I see children playing, like children play everywhere. They play all sorts of games, under the directions of teachers or by themselves, There are rows and rows of barracks. My interviewee is Mrs. Anna Braun, who is here with a group of about 500 Mennonites. They live together in one block which I intend to visit later, men and women together as one community and in one large room, separated as I am told by some kind of tent material and sleeping in wide two level bunks, often a different family on each level. The interview proceeds in German.The origin of the Mennonites can be traced to the 16th century Anabaptist movement. Menno Simons, a Dutch religious leader, united the scattered Anabaptist congregations of northern Europe that became called by his name.1

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:32.823
David Boder: And so, Mrs. Braun, will you kindly tell me what is your name, how old are you, where were you born?

00:01:32.823 --> 00:01:44.414
Anna Braun: My name is Anna Braun. I am 40 years old. I was born in Einlage [this sound like a German name but the locality is in Russia, maybe she doesn’t get the name clearly] in the district Zaporozhe, in the Ukraine.The Zaporozhye district is located in the eastern portion of Ukraine. The city of Zaporozhye itself is located on the Dnieper River. Mennonite villages were located on both sides of this key waterway.2

00:01:44.414 --> 00:01:47.454
David Boder: Yes. If you have difficulties just say it in Russian.

00:01:47.454 --> 00:01:49.424
Anna Braun: Yes.

00:01:49.424 --> 00:01:52.866
David Boder: Zaporozhe, in the Ukraine. That is your birthplace, is that so?

00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:53.488
Anna Braun: Yes.

00:01:53.488 --> 00:01:56.550
David Boder: Who were your parents?

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:05.149
Anna Braun: My parents were [she hesitates] Cornelius Peter and my mother,-

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.491
David Boder: Yes. Never mind the names. What was their occupation?

00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:08.958
Anna Braun: Yes.

00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:12.255
David Boder: What was your family doing?

00:02:12.255 --> 00:02:14.622
Anna Braun: My father was the proprietor of a mill.

00:02:14.622 --> 00:02:15.612
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:15.612 --> 00:02:19.969
Anna Braun: He had a large steam-powered flour mill in Tartiza.The exact location for this town was not found, nor was the exact location of the village of Kitchka mentioned subsequently. [???]3

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:21.693
David Boder: Oh, then he was not a farmer?

00:02:21.693 --> 00:02:22.251
Anna Braun: No.

00:02:22.251 --> 00:02:26.015
David Boder: Oh. Now you have with you here two children? How old are the children?

00:02:26.015 --> 00:02:33.119
Anna Braun: My oldest daughter, my stepdaughter, is twenty years old and the younger is ten years old.

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:35.110
David Boder: Were you married twice?

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.798
Anna Braun: No, I married a man in 1935, a widower.

00:02:41.798 --> 00:02:43.933
David Boder: And you took his daughter with you?

00:02:43.933 --> 00:02:46.996
Anna Braun: Yes.

00:02:46.996 --> 00:03:01.879
David Boder: Now, Mrs. Braun, will you tell me where you were when the war started and what happened to you during the war up to this date.

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:39.509
Anna Braun: I worked in Zaporozhe as a technical draftsman in the Dnieper Steel Works...[a pause] When the war started many were dismissed from that plant. I remained until the evacuation, that is until the whole plant had to retreat.The German invasion proceeded initially with devastating rapidity resulting in the conquest of large parts of the Soviet Union and the capture of millions of prisoners. Orders were given to evacuate as many factories as possible beyond the Ural mountains out of the reach of the invading Germans.4

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:40.700
David Boder: You mean the plant was evacuated.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:04:03.197
Anna Braun: Yes. The whole plant was to be evacuated. Since the plant was located on the right shore of Dnieper while my home was located on the left shore of the Dnieper, I went back to my family on the left shore.

00:04:03.197 --> 00:04:08.085
David Boder: That is then east?

00:04:08.085 --> 00:04:08.799
Anna Braun: [Hesitating as if trying to orientate herself] Yes, eastward.

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.508
David Boder: Yes, the Dnieper flows southward.

00:04:11.508 --> 00:04:12.136
Anna Braun: Yes.

00:04:12.136 --> 00:04:17.480
David Boder: So you went to the side nearest to the Russians.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:17.767
Anna Braun: [confused] Yes.

00:04:17.767 --> 00:04:21.599
David Boder: The Germans came from the West. The Russians and you went back to the other side?

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:40.165
Anna Braun: Yes. Then I didn’t know it whether it was on the German side or the Russian side. At any rate we came home. I stayed home for two days, and here the Germans arrived.

00:04:40.165 --> 00:04:42.894
David Boder: Who was at home with you?

00:04:42.894 --> 00:04:51.467
Anna Braun: With me at home was my step-mother and my two daughters.Mrs. Braun misspoke here. She had a stepfather not a stepmother. The fate of her mother is not mentioned in the interview.5

00:04:51.467 --> 00:04:53.432
David Boder: And where was your husband?

00:04:53.432 --> 00:05:05.177
Anna Braun: My husband was arrested already in 1936, on the 16th of October.This was just prior to the 1937-38 Great Terror, years of mass arrests and executions which spread from the communist party hierarchy throughout Soviet society. From 1918 on, however, mass arrests, deportations, incarcerations and executions had taken place in the Soviet Union. The arrest rate among Mennonites was considerably higher than that for the general population.6

00:05:05.177 --> 00:05:16.449
David Boder: Why? Would you please tell me in detail the whole story. Why was your husband arrested, and other people of your sect as well?

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:44.677
Anna Braun: Why? We never learned the reason, but it must have been on account of our religion. When my father, already in 1919 was killed by a band, my mother married a second time—that is my step-father.

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:46.456
David Boder: Your mother married a second time?

00:05:46.456 --> 00:05:56.655
Anna Braun: Yes. He also was my uncle. My step-father was the elder of the[one work not clear]Mennonite community, of the congregation. Rather of the Polish.

00:05:56.655 --> 00:05:59.667
David Boder: Yes.

00:05:59.667 --> 00:06:13.719
Anna Braun: Already in 1929 he and my mother were deported to the Ural.It is not clear if this refers to Ural Kazakhstan or to a location in the Ural mountains.7

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:18.352
David Boder: Yes. Your step-father was deported to the Ural?

00:06:18.352 --> 00:06:18.920
Anna Braun: Yes.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.724
David Boder: Well....

00:06:20.724 --> 00:06:26.400
Anna Braun: That was on account of our religion because he was the older of—

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.054
David Boder: The Mennonites?

00:06:27.054 --> 00:06:34.290
Anna Braun: Of the Mennonite community. There he remained for five years.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:35.526
David Boder: And you remained at home?

00:06:35.526 --> 00:06:44.748
Anna Braun: And I remained at home. And only after my father returned home I got married.

00:06:44.748 --> 00:06:47.105
David Boder: Then your father had returned from the Ural?

00:06:47.105 --> 00:06:47.648
Anna Braun: Yes.

00:06:47.648 --> 00:06:49.553
David Boder: With your mother?

00:06:49.553 --> 00:06:50.322
Anna Braun: With the mother.

00:06:50.322 --> 00:06:54.900
David Boder: So. What was it? Did he serve there a term as punishment and was then sent back?

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.895
Anna Braun: He apparently was there as punishment.

00:06:58.895 --> 00:07:01.322
David Boder: Well, he was sent away and then returned.

00:07:01.322 --> 00:07:02.769
Anna Braun: He was sent away and the returned.

00:07:02.769 --> 00:07:04.568
David Boder: And when did he return?

00:07:04.568 --> 00:07:07.358
Anna Braun: He returned in 1935.

00:07:07.358 --> 00:07:14.353
David Boder: What did he tell you? What happened to him there at the Ural?

00:07:14.353 --> 00:07:46.298
Anna Braun: He personally worked in an office at the Ural. The food was bad, just like for all the others who were there. There were all kinds of people at the Ural. Most of them starved to death there.

00:07:46.298 --> 00:07:51.163
David Boder: And so your father and mother came back—that is your step-father—in 1935?

00:07:51.163 --> 00:07:51.801
Anna Braun: Yes.

00:07:51.801 --> 00:07:56.786
David Boder: So was he then with you when the Germans came?

00:07:56.786 --> 00:08:15.308
Anna Braun: No. After he spent three years at home, that is, at Einlage, he had no home any more, his home was taken away from him. After he was here three years in Einlage...

00:08:15.308 --> 00:08:17.082
David Boder: Is Einlage the name of the town?

00:08:17.082 --> 00:08:18.856
Anna Braun: Yes. Einlage is the name of the village.

00:08:18.856 --> 00:08:21.685
David Boder: Yes. Did the village have the German name?

00:08:21.685 --> 00:08:25.092
Anna Braun: Einlage.....Yes.

00:08:25.092 --> 00:08:26.479
David Boder: And what did they call the village in Russian?

00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:27.243
Anna Braun: Kitchka.

00:08:27.243 --> 00:08:29.570
David Boder: Kitchka. Well, go on.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:42.314
Anna Braun: After three years in Kitchka he was arrested again and he was put in prison. And up to this day we have not heard from him.

00:08:42.314 --> 00:08:49.274
David Boder: You mentioned something about a death sentence. How sure are you of that?

00:08:49.274 --> 00:08:55.811
Anna Braun: In ’35 I got married. In ’36 they took the man, after six months.

00:08:55.811 --> 00:08:56.802
David Boder: Whose husband did they take?

00:08:56.802 --> 00:08:57.601
Anna Braun: My husband.

00:08:57.601 --> 00:08:59.124
David Boder: Oh, then it was your husband.

00:08:59.124 --> 00:08:59.632
Anna Braun: Yes.

00:08:59.632 --> 00:09:01.547
David Boder: And in ’35 you weren’t married.

00:09:01.547 --> 00:09:02.266
Anna Braun: Yes.

00:09:02.266 --> 00:09:04.271
David Boder: And in ’36 they arrested your husband?

00:09:04.271 --> 00:09:05.055
Anna Braun: They arrested my husband.

00:09:05.055 --> 00:09:06.919
David Boder: Did you have already the baby?

00:09:06.919 --> 00:09:14.009
Anna Braun: Yes. It was three months old.

00:09:14.009 --> 00:09:18.124
David Boder: Go on.

00:09:18.124 --> 00:09:27.624
Anna Braun: And so one night they fetched my husband after they searched the house for three long hours.

00:09:27.624 --> 00:09:30.986
David Boder: Yes. What were they searching for?

00:09:30.986 --> 00:09:39.679
Anna Braun: They took with them foreign correspondence. Otherwise I don’t know what they were looking for.

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:41.921
David Boder: So what kind of foreign correspondence was it?

00:09:41.921 --> 00:09:46.974
Anna Braun: We had only the letters from our relatives in America.

00:09:46.974 --> 00:09:48.894
David Boder: Oh. From the Mennonites in America.The Soviets were deeply suspicious of anyone who had contacts with capitalistic America, an arch-ideological enemy.8

00:09:48.894 --> 00:09:49.211
Anna Braun: Yes.

00:09:49.211 --> 00:09:50.251
David Boder: Go on.

00:09:50.251 --> 00:10:09.213
Anna Braun: All these letters were taken and they were never returned, and my man was taken and after six months of imprisonment he was sentenced to death by the Kharkov Military Tribunal.Kharkov was the second largest city in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, Kiev being the first. During the Holocaust 21,685 Jews were murdered in Kharkov.9

00:10:09.213 --> 00:10:10.872
David Boder: Were you at the trial?

00:10:10.872 --> 00:10:13.128
Anna Braun: No. I was not admitted.

00:10:13.128 --> 00:10:14.344
David Boder: Were you in Kharkov?

00:10:14.344 --> 00:10:15.008
Anna Braun: Yes.

00:10:15.008 --> 00:10:18.400
David Boder: Then who told you what sentence he was given?

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:38.330
Anna Braun: In Kharkov at the offices of the Military Tribunal they told me so. The third of July, ’37, I was told the sentence was upheld in Moscow, in June, ’37.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.913
David Boder: Yes. Have you seen your husband after he was sentenced?

00:10:41.913 --> 00:10:42.782
Anna Braun: No.

00:10:42.782 --> 00:10:44.159
David Boder: Were you not permitted to see him?

00:10:44.159 --> 00:10:44.792
Anna Braun: No.

00:10:44.792 --> 00:10:47.647
David Boder: So. And what happened afterwards?

00:10:47.647 --> 00:11:00.230
Anna Braun: Afterwards...you see the sentences was pronounced in Zaporozhe. From Zaporozhe my husband was taken to Dnepropetrovsk.Dnepropetrovsk is located just northwest of Zaporozhye.10

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:02.275
David Boder: But you said something about Kharkov.

00:11:02.275 --> 00:11:08.425
Anna Braun: The Kharkov Military tribunal tried him in Zaporozhe.

00:11:08.425 --> 00:11:10.405
David Boder: Oh. Well, go on.

00:11:10.405 --> 00:11:27.797
Anna Braun: And then he was taken after a trial from Zaporozhe to Dnepropetrovsk. There I was still able to bring him food up until June, the middle of June.

00:11:27.797 --> 00:11:29.350
David Boder: What were you doing, going there everyday?

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:58.707
Anna Braun: No. I went there once a week. And I would bring him food and clean underwear. Everytime they accepted from me these things and every time my husband had to write on the slip of paper on which I had enumerated all the things that I brought for him: that “all these things I have recieved”.

00:11:58.707 --> 00:12:01.164
David Boder: Was he able to return the soiled underwear?

00:12:01.164 --> 00:12:03.290
Anna Braun: Yes, he also would send back the soiled clothes.

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:04.436
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:04.436 --> 00:12:12.704
Anna Braun: [Hesitant] And the things were always very dirty.

00:12:12.704 --> 00:12:19.849
David Boder: Why?

00:12:19.849 --> 00:12:26.176
Anna Braun: [She hesitates and weeps.] Once the things were so soiled and moist.

00:12:26.176 --> 00:12:30.633
David Boder: What do you mean?

00:12:30.633 --> 00:12:32.772
Anna Braun: [Breaks out in tears.] They were stained with blood.

00:12:32.772 --> 00:12:36.063
David Boder: So, well.

00:12:36.063 --> 00:12:48.471
Anna Braun: Before I hadn’t noticed it. The things were full of sweat and yellow, but every week I brought him new underwear.

00:12:48.471 --> 00:12:50.064
David Boder: Clean underwear or new underwear?

00:12:50.064 --> 00:12:51.154
Anna Braun: Clean underwear.

00:12:51.154 --> 00:12:54.873
David Boder: Yes, go on.

00:12:54.873 --> 00:13:13.000
Anna Braun: At any rate he received the things every time. Then it was the end of June. I jouned again to Dnepropetrovsk in order to bring him food and clothes and he wasn’t there any more.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.432
David Boder: And what did they tell you?

00:13:14.432 --> 00:13:20.382
Anna Braun: And so they told me “departed”, and nothing else. Such an answer could as well have been given by the clerk of an hotel upon inquiry about a guest who is not there any more. it is possible that the prison, being under civilian authority, had nothing to do with the execution of sentences of military tribunals. This was in the hand of the military; they often demanded the surrender of the prisoner who as far as the warden of the prison was concerned was then simply considered discharged or so to speak out from under the warden’s jurisdiction.The use of euphemisms by bureaucracies of totalitarian regimes is quite common. It serves to still consciences and mask brutalities.11

00:13:20.382 --> 00:13:21.000
David Boder: Departed?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:29.587
Anna Braun: Yes. Departed. I immediately journeyed to Kharkov.[She hesitates]

00:13:29.587 --> 00:13:30.492
David Boder: To the authorities?

00:13:30.492 --> 00:14:08.180
Anna Braun: To the authorities of the Military Tribunal and there at the office they looked him up and told me that the case is known to them and that the sentence was confirmed in Moscow in June. And so I asked them: ‘Is there anything I can still do?’ —because I had been in Moscow already three times so they told me, ‘Not a thing’. And since then I know nothing about my husband. The 16th of October it will be 10 years.Mrs. Braun’s unceasing efforts on behalf of her imprisoned husband are most laudable.12

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:13.829
David Boder: Tell me Mrs. Braun, were there other people sentenced with your husband or was he alone on trial?

00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:34.649
Anna Braun: Ten men were sentenced together with him on the same day. All of them lived before in Kitchka—Einlage. All of them except three...also seven of the men were Mennonites and three were not Mennonites.

00:14:34.649 --> 00:14:39.254
David Boder: How did they happen to get together into the same trial?

00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:54.373
Anna Braun: That I never could find out because the other three, the non-Mennonites, I had never known and I had never heard that my husband had known them.

00:14:54.373 --> 00:14:59.348
David Boder: What were they accused of? What was the indictment?

00:14:59.348 --> 00:15:04.721
Anna Braun: They always refered to the case of GESTA but I don’t know a thing more about it.False charges of sabotage and/or espionage were used to get rid of so-called enemies of the state who could also be blamed for production shortages or bureaucratic malfeasance or incompetence.13

00:15:04.721 --> 00:15:06.648
David Boder: What is GESTA?

00:15:06.648 --> 00:15:13.141
Anna Braun: That means the Hydro-Electric Generating Station.

00:15:13.141 --> 00:15:17.739
David Boder: Oh. Did your husband work for the GESTA?

00:15:17.739 --> 00:15:25.624
Anna Braun: My husband worked in the main office of GESTA.

00:15:25.624 --> 00:15:27.086
David Boder: So. What kind of a job did he hold there?

00:15:27.086 --> 00:15:33.086
Anna Braun: [hesitantly and in between sobs]He was an economist.

00:15:33.086 --> 00:15:35.728
David Boder: Oh, did he study economy?

00:15:35.728 --> 00:15:37.502
Anna Braun: No, that he did not.

00:15:37.502 --> 00:15:40.613
David Boder: Oh. But he has been working in the department of economics?

00:15:40.613 --> 00:15:47.040
Anna Braun: Yes. He worked there and had a great deal of experience.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:16:05.663
David Boder: And then. [She hesitates again] Continue, Mrs. Braun. [The pause continues for a long time] So you remained alone. Did you ever get a certificate that you are a widow?

00:16:05.663 --> 00:16:08.186
Anna Braun: Never.

00:16:08.186 --> 00:16:10.452
David Boder: They did not give you such a certificate?

00:16:10.452 --> 00:16:11.035
Anna Braun: No.

00:16:11.035 --> 00:16:17.832
David Boder: Do the Mennonites consider you a widow?

00:16:17.832 --> 00:17:10.551
Anna Braun: [After a pause] Neither. I am definitely convinced that my husband is dead.[ here she weeps again] But my oldest daughter as well as many Mennonites—and that is because they have such a firm faith that the Lord will not permit such a thing to happen—so we also believe in a miracle that somewhere in some way my husband may still be alive. My daughter constantly tells me this hope nobody can take from me.

00:17:10.551 --> 00:17:13.611
David Boder: Under such conditions you could not get married?

00:17:13.611 --> 00:17:15.058
Anna Braun: No.

00:17:15.058 --> 00:17:18.179
David Boder: Do widows among the Mennonites marry in general?

00:17:18.179 --> 00:17:20.475
Anna Braun: Yes.

00:17:20.475 --> 00:17:29.260
David Boder: Well, Now then what happened when the Germans came. You went to the other side of the Dneiper, you were telling me, to your family?

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:29.717
Anna Braun: Yes.

00:17:29.717 --> 00:17:33.074
David Boder: And then?

00:17:33.074 --> 00:18:31.197
Anna Braun: When the Germans came the locality where we lived was exactly at the front. This lasted for about a month and a half and then we had to leave our home and our belongings and had to be evacuated. But not far away, about 20 kilometers from our home. Afterwards, when the Russians retreated again and the Germans marched on we were able again to return home. Much was destroyed, but in our home besides the window panes nothing much was damaged.

00:18:31.197 --> 00:18:33.459
David Boder: How long were you away from home?

00:18:33.459 --> 00:18:36.117
Anna Braun: We were away a whole month.

00:18:36.117 --> 00:18:40.707
David Boder: Now what happened. The Germans came and then the Russians returned?

00:18:40.707 --> 00:18:53.794
Anna Braun: No. Then the Germans came and the Russians retreated. And so we remained for a year. But then the Russians came again.In fact, the Mennonite communities of the Zaporozhye district were under control of the Germans for two years. The German defeat at the epic battle of Stalingrad in the winter of 1943 marked the turning point in the war with the Soviet Union. This was followed by the German defeat in the battle of Kursk in July-August, 1943. From then on the Red army was on the offensive.14

00:18:53.794 --> 00:18:57.640
David Boder: Oh, so that was how it was. You remained for a year under the Germans. You did not leave.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:22.344
Anna Braun: No, we did not leave, but when the Russians approached again and the shooting started and we found ourselves again on the front and many homes were destroyed, and there were quite a few casualties we had to leave again our house and our belongings. Now we were embarked into trains.Mrs. Braun describes an unpleasant and arduous rail journey, but one that was markedly better than the deadly rail journey taken by Jews to extermination centers.15

00:19:22.344 --> 00:19:23.138
David Boder: By whom?

00:19:23.138 --> 00:19:32.238
Anna Braun: By the Germans. We were embarked into trains and we did not know where we were going but we traveled ahead....

00:19:32.238 --> 00:19:33.515
David Boder: Towards the west?

00:19:33.515 --> 00:19:34.646
Anna Braun: Towards the west.

00:19:34.646 --> 00:19:42.875
David Boder: Will you please tell me something about these trains. How were you embarked? How many people were on the train, and in general what were you told?

00:19:42.875 --> 00:19:57.429
Anna Braun: We were told that we should take with us only our food. We were assigned thirty-five people for one cattle car.

00:19:57.429 --> 00:19:58.308
David Boder: Thirty-five?

00:19:58.308 --> 00:20:02.660
Anna Braun: Thirty-five people and all our belongings.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:03.916
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:03.916 --> 00:20:12.457
Anna Braun: The sick were embarked separately in passenger cars. There were among them very sick people.

00:20:12.457 --> 00:20:14.412
David Boder: Were they all Mennonites?

00:20:14.412 --> 00:20:40.002
Anna Braun: There were.....no. There were all kinds of people. Mennonites, Russians, also Ukrainians. There were few Russian Ukrainians but there were many volks-Germans from various places. Refugees.

00:20:40.002 --> 00:20:45.023
David Boder: By volks-Germans you mean those who lived for generations in Saratov and thereabout, the German colonists, is that so?

00:20:45.023 --> 00:20:45.526
Anna Braun: The Germans colonists. Yes.

00:20:45.526 --> 00:20:48.003
David Boder: Of course, they were not all Mennonites?

00:20:48.003 --> 00:20:50.764
Anna Braun: No, no, no.

00:20:50.764 --> 00:20:58.180
David Boder: They were just volks-Germans and you were embarked about thirty-five in one cattle car with all the belongings and so you were evacuated.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:58.401
Anna Braun: Yes.

00:20:58.401 --> 00:21:04.601
David Boder: How were you fed? What kind of toilet facilities did you have?

00:21:04.601 --> 00:21:33.983
Anna Braun: There were no toilets. For hours we were traveling and then finally the train would stop at the station and everybody would go down. Otherwise there was no chance “to go out”. For the children the women had their toilet pots with them and the content was poured out of the window, while the train was in motion.

00:21:33.983 --> 00:21:37.380
David Boder: What kind of windows were in these cars?

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:47.635
Anna Braun: There were small windows near the ceiling which could be either kept open or shut.

00:21:47.635 --> 00:21:50.967
David Boder: And where did you finally arrive?

00:21:50.967 --> 00:21:52.801
Anna Braun: Then we arrived....

00:21:52.801 --> 00:21:55.665
David Boder: Were there any benches in those cars?

00:21:55.665 --> 00:22:00.385
Anna Braun: No. There were no benches. We sat on our bundles.

00:22:00.385 --> 00:22:03.043
David Boder: You are talking now about the evacuation arranged by the Germans?

00:22:03.043 --> 00:22:03.908
Anna Braun: Yes.

00:22:03.908 --> 00:22:05.119
David Boder: Now go on.

00:22:05.119 --> 00:22:11.333
Anna Braun: People sat on their things. On trunks, bedding......

00:22:11.333 --> 00:22:12.112
David Boder: Trunks, bedding and bundles?

00:22:12.112 --> 00:22:22.141
Anna Braun: ...and bundles, yes. People took turns to sleep on those thing because people would just fall over each other.

00:22:22.141 --> 00:22:23.598
David Boder: Why?

00:22:23.598 --> 00:22:37.086
Anna Braun: Because during the trip the doors were locked. Nobody could get out. The air would become heavy.

00:22:37.086 --> 00:22:38.729
David Boder: Go ahead.

00:22:38.729 --> 00:22:46.830
Anna Braun: Then we arrived...we traveled for 14 days until we arrived at Lipmanstadt. [Footnote: Like in the case of so many DPs, here geographic orientation is confused.]Mrs. Braun is confusing Litzmannstadt (what she terms Lipmanstadt), the German name for Łódź, with L’viv (Ger. Lemberg), a large industrial and cultural center in western Ukraine. Of a Jewish community of 110,000 at the start of the war, only a handful of the Jews of L’viv remained alive at liberation.16

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:47.685
David Boder: Where is that?

00:22:47.685 --> 00:22:49.368
Anna Braun: Lipmanstadt is in Poland.

00:22:49.368 --> 00:22:53.459
David Boder: Oh, yes. How do they call that town in Polish?

00:22:53.459 --> 00:22:54.338
Anna Braun: Lwow.

00:22:54.338 --> 00:22:56.429
David Boder: Oh. Lwow.. Oh, Yes. You got to Lwow..

00:22:56.429 --> 00:22:57.932
Anna Braun: Yes.

00:22:57.932 --> 00:22:59.515
David Boder: Go on.

00:22:59.515 --> 00:23:28.208
Anna Braun: There we got to a transient lager. There we bathed and changed our clothes. We were given hot food, and from there we proceeded to Neustadt. That is in West [?] Prussia.Neustadt (German for “new town”) is the name for a number of towns in Germany. The northern German city of Neustadt where Mrs. Braun and her daughters were interned is now in Poland along with the nearby city of Danzig, now Gdansk.17

00:23:28.208 --> 00:23:29.515
David Boder: Neustadt. West Prussia.

00:23:29.515 --> 00:23:51.400
Anna Braun: Neustadt. West Prussia. In Neustadt there was a very big lager. And there our transport disembarked. There were in the lager more than two thousand people.

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:54.435
David Boder: Who were they? Were there Jews among them?

00:23:54.435 --> 00:23:56.201
Anna Braun: There were no Jews.

00:23:56.201 --> 00:23:59.940
David Boder: Who were there? Were there any gypsies?

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:05.742
Anna Braun: There were many different nationalities, but no Jews.

00:24:05.742 --> 00:24:09.526
David Boder: I have asked you before, were there any gypsies?

00:24:09.526 --> 00:24:11.792
Anna Braun: [Hesitantly, as if suprised] Gypsies....

00:24:11.792 --> 00:24:13.059
David Boder: Well, you didn’t see any?

00:24:13.059 --> 00:24:16.432
Anna Braun: No, I have not noticed any gypsies.

00:24:16.432 --> 00:24:18.356
David Boder: Let’s go on. Were there any Russians? French?

00:24:18.356 --> 00:24:21.185
Anna Braun: Russians. Frenchmen.These were undoubtedly forced labor workers whom the Nazis deported to work in German war industries. They were not exterminated like Jews and Gypsies (Roma) but were conscripted against their will and lived under the trying conditions Mrs. Braun describes.18

00:24:21.185 --> 00:24:27.097
David Boder: Well. Now describe the life in such a lager.

00:24:27.097 --> 00:24:52.874
Anna Braun: Life in such a lager was terrible. First, such a lager was full of bedbugs. That was the most terrible thing in these lagers, the bedbugs. One couldn’t sleep nights the bedbugs were so bad. And it was obvious that they cannot be driven away. There were no means to get rid of them.

00:24:52.874 --> 00:25:00.336
David Boder: Now tell me, how would the day pass in such a lager? What time did you get up?

00:25:00.336 --> 00:25:04.989
Anna Braun: Well, that differed. Those who worked had to get up early.

00:25:04.989 --> 00:25:08.411
David Boder: And who had to work?

00:25:08.411 --> 00:25:15.593
Anna Braun: Everybody, young people up to the age of 40 had to work.

00:25:15.593 --> 00:25:17.312
David Boder: Were you compelled to work?

00:25:17.312 --> 00:25:18.423
Anna Braun: I, too.

00:25:18.423 --> 00:25:19.353
David Boder: Your daughter?

00:25:19.353 --> 00:25:20.454
Anna Braun: My daughter.

00:25:20.454 --> 00:25:21.484
David Boder: And the little one?

00:25:21.484 --> 00:25:24.740
Anna Braun: The little one—she did not work.

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.127
David Boder: Well, she wasn’t then yet ten years old.

00:25:26.127 --> 00:25:29.272
Anna Braun: She is now ten years old. Then she was—

00:25:29.272 --> 00:25:29.798
David Boder: Eight?

00:25:29.798 --> 00:25:32.502
Anna Braun: 1943...she was seven years old.

00:25:32.502 --> 00:25:36.108
David Boder: What was the little one doing all day?

00:25:36.108 --> 00:25:42.666
Anna Braun: Since in a room about [she stops, searching apparently for words to describe the size of the room]

00:25:42.666 --> 00:25:44.289
David Boder: Was it the size of this room?

00:25:44.289 --> 00:25:46.138
Anna Braun: The size of this room.

00:25:46.138 --> 00:25:51.810
David Boder: Well, this room is about four by six meters.

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:55.895
Anna Braun: Since ten to twelve people had to live in a room like this one.

00:25:55.895 --> 00:25:57.913
David Boder: Well what do you mean people? Women...

00:25:57.913 --> 00:25:59.988
Anna Braun: Women and men as well. And children with them.

00:25:59.988 --> 00:26:07.047
David Boder: Men, women, and children in the same room? How many men were there in the room which you lived?

00:26:07.047 --> 00:26:19.141
Anna Braun: In that room there was one man...and the others were women and children.

00:26:19.141 --> 00:26:24.544
David Boder: Now how were the beds arranged? One over the other at three levels?

00:26:24.544 --> 00:26:28.298
Anna Braun: No, the beds were of two levels.

00:26:28.298 --> 00:26:30.966
David Boder: Was the man there with his wife?

00:26:30.966 --> 00:26:32.494
Anna Braun: The man was there with his wife.

00:26:32.494 --> 00:26:34.961
David Boder: Well, go on.

00:26:34.961 --> 00:26:41.456
Anna Braun: So there was always somebody in the room and I could leave there my little daughter.

00:26:41.456 --> 00:26:43.416
David Boder: Oh. So you left your little daughter with somebody in the room?

00:26:43.416 --> 00:26:44.175
Anna Braun: Yes.

00:26:44.175 --> 00:26:50.662
David Boder: Did the little one go there to some school? Did they play some games? Did they teach her something? Was there some entertainment [for her]?

00:26:50.662 --> 00:27:00.867
Anna Braun: No, there was no school for the little one. The children gathered in the yard and there they—

00:27:00.867 --> 00:27:01.420
David Boder: Passed their time?

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:05.566
Anna Braun: Passed their time. I worked....

00:27:05.566 --> 00:27:10.114
David Boder: When you got up in the morning did you get something to eat?

00:27:10.114 --> 00:27:14.400
Anna Braun: Yes. In the morning we fetched our food from the central kitchen.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.807
David Boder: And what was that?

00:27:15.807 --> 00:27:28.168
Anna Braun: That was coffee and black bread. The rest of the cold supplies we were given once a week.

00:27:28.168 --> 00:27:30.052
David Boder: That was what?

00:27:30.052 --> 00:27:34.424
Anna Braun: That was butter....

00:27:34.424 --> 00:27:36.007
David Boder: Margerine?

00:27:36.007 --> 00:27:42.183
Anna Braun: Marmalade, no. We also got butter sometimes, butter, margerine, marmalade.

00:27:42.183 --> 00:27:43.766
David Boder: Any sausage?

00:27:43.766 --> 00:27:45.590
Anna Braun: Some sausage.

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:53.137
David Boder: Well, so you got your coffee. Did you have an appel? Did they count every morning the people in the lager?

00:27:53.137 --> 00:28:01.446
Anna Braun: No. That was not done. Possible—there was in every room a room trustee—maybe he had to report it.

00:28:01.446 --> 00:28:02.647
David Boder: But you had no appel?

00:28:02.647 --> 00:28:03.320
Anna Braun: No.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:10.064
David Boder: And then you would go to work? What kind of work were you doing?

00:28:10.064 --> 00:28:16.009
Anna Braun: I personally would come home only once a week because I worked away from the lager.

00:28:16.009 --> 00:28:18.104
David Boder: And your older daughter?

00:28:18.104 --> 00:28:22.637
Anna Braun: My older daughter worked there in the lager.

00:28:22.637 --> 00:28:26.048
David Boder: Where was the place outside of the lager, and were did you live?

00:28:26.048 --> 00:28:30.752
Anna Braun: I worked 36 kilometers away from Neustadt.

00:28:30.752 --> 00:28:31.621
David Boder: In what capacity?

00:28:31.621 --> 00:28:33.320
Anna Braun: As a technical draftswoman.

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:42.375
David Boder: Oh, yes, you were a technical draftswoman already at home. And so you worked as a technical draftswoman for the Germans. And what were you drafting?

00:28:42.375 --> 00:28:47.008
Anna Braun: I drafted some diagrams and curves.

00:28:47.008 --> 00:28:48.847
David Boder: For what purpose?

00:28:48.847 --> 00:29:00.805
Anna Braun: That was for an experimental laboratory. They wouldn’t give me even titles of the drawings so I never knew for what purpose the drawings were made.

00:29:00.805 --> 00:29:08.059
David Boder: Now tell me, Mrs. Braun, the Mennonites are against was and do not bear arms; isn’t that so?

00:29:08.059 --> 00:29:08.989
Anna Braun: Yes.

00:29:08.989 --> 00:29:16.944
David Boder: Isn’t it the same thing to help the war when you participate in the construction of war material?

00:29:16.944 --> 00:29:26.135
Anna Braun: Of course, it is the same. If one does it intentionally it is the same thing.

00:29:26.135 --> 00:29:28.753
David Boder: And you didn’t know what you were really doing?

00:29:28.753 --> 00:29:33.660
Anna Braun: No. I didn’t know up to this date. I don’t know whether I worked for the war.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:38.157
David Boder: Go on.

00:29:38.157 --> 00:29:56.422
Anna Braun: On Saturdays I would return to the lager. There I remained over Sunday and Sunday night I would return again to the shores of the Baltic sea. I worked right on the Baltic sea.

00:29:56.422 --> 00:30:04.167
David Boder: Oh, you worked on the Baltic Sea. Is Neustadt near Koeningsberg?Koenigsberg was then in East Prussia. Today it has been renamed Kaliningrad and is under Russian control. Though on the Baltic, it is considerably east of Danzig (Gdansk).19

00:30:04.167 --> 00:30:19.173
Anna Braun: Yes. Neustadt is not far from Danzig. And this experimental laboratory was called experimental plant Grossendorf. That’s what they called it. No other name.

00:30:19.173 --> 00:30:23.033
David Boder: And how did the Germans behave towards you?

00:30:23.033 --> 00:30:30.258
Anna Braun: That varied a great deal. There were such who behaved themselves well. But there were also such who behaved very badly.

00:30:30.258 --> 00:30:35.957
David Boder: In what way?

00:30:35.957 --> 00:31:04.982
Anna Braun: Well, at work they treated me well because they were satisfied with my work. You see all my life I liked drafting a great deal and so my work was very efficient. And so as technical draftswoman I was always treated well. But when one would return to the lager one was not well treated by the lager commander.

00:31:04.982 --> 00:31:07.188
David Boder: Did he beat the people?

00:31:07.188 --> 00:31:09.942
Anna Braun: Yes, he used to beat the people!

00:31:09.942 --> 00:31:12.118
David Boder: For what reasons?

00:31:12.118 --> 00:31:23.158
Anna Braun: There were people who did not submit to the discipline of the lager, and for that they were punished. They were beaten, by the lager commander as well.

00:31:23.158 --> 00:31:26.756
David Boder: So there was direct corporal punishment?

00:31:26.756 --> 00:31:32.269
Anna Braun: Yes.

00:31:32.269 --> 00:31:38.515
David Boder: And how long did that last? How long were you there in Neustadt?

00:31:38.515 --> 00:31:46.246
Anna Braun: In Neustadt we were....[pause, reminiscing] nearly a year.

00:31:46.246 --> 00:31:48.261
David Boder: And then it was already what year?

00:31:48.261 --> 00:31:58.980
Anna Braun: It was—we arrived there in 1943 and stayed there until December of ’44.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:02.563
David Boder: Until December of ’44. Well, what happened then?

00:32:02.563 --> 00:33:01.482
Anna Braun: Well, then they evacuated the experimental plant in which I worked. They evacuated the plant to Czechoslovakia. We came to Czechoslovakia. There we continued working. All those who worked at the plant had to be evacuated with it. And so I personally with my family was for a time separated from the rest of the Mennonites. That lasted four months in Czechoslovakia. Then we had to evacuate from there as well and were to go directly to Munich, but we didn’t get that far. Approximately 60 kilometers from Munich we saw the approach of the Americans.At the time it was not known as Czechoslovakia. The Czech portions of prewar Czechoslovakia had been taken over by the Germans and renamed the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Slovakia became a Nazi puppet state.20

00:33:01.482 --> 00:33:04.311
David Boder: In what kind of trains were you transported?

00:33:04.311 --> 00:33:06.140
Anna Braun: We traveled by automobile.

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:07.567
David Boder: Passenger cars, trucks?

00:33:07.567 --> 00:33:09.767
Anna Braun: Trucks.

00:33:09.767 --> 00:33:12.204
David Boder: And how many people on a truck?

00:33:12.204 --> 00:33:16.918
Anna Braun: We were twenty-two people on a truck with our bundles.

00:33:16.918 --> 00:33:18.762
David Boder: Then you were sitting on your bundles?

00:33:18.762 --> 00:33:20.712
Anna Braun: We sat on our bundles.

00:33:20.712 --> 00:33:28.566
David Boder: And so 60 miles from Munich you met the Americans. Who were they? Tell us something about the liberation?

00:33:28.566 --> 00:34:01.828
Anna Braun: We arrived by truck to Heilenbach near Rosenheim. Here our transport—fuehrer abandoned us. He told us the Americans are near and so he left us simply in that little town and he himself got away with the truck. We remained simply on the street. Nobody wanted to let us in. It was pouring and we were all wet.[Here Mrs. Braun cough repeatedly. This is akin to the coughing and choking which some interviewees manifest when they speak of the disinfecting procedures, or travel in bad weather]

00:34:01.828 --> 00:34:03.346
David Boder: About how many of you were there?

00:34:03.346 --> 00:34:05.092
Anna Braun: We were twenty-two people.

00:34:05.092 --> 00:34:06.600
David Boder: Oh, there was only one truck.

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.665
Anna Braun: There was only one truck. We were separated from the others en route.

00:34:09.665 --> 00:34:13.471
David Boder: Who was that fuehrer? Was he an SS man? Who was he?

00:34:13.471 --> 00:35:15.464
Anna Braun: The fuehrer was an engineer of the firm for which we worked. His name was Larson. He himself was a Swede, but he worked in the plant for the Germans, out of free will. Afterwards he has so swindled us and deceived us that he has stolen nearly all our things because we had a trailer on the truck and there was a large part of our baggage. The trailer had to be left in a certain place and we never saw our things, although he had promised us to bring them to us, but we never saw our things again. Later we heard that he was arrested in Frankfurt.......Nazi collaborators, such as the Swedish engineer described by Mrs. Braun, assisted them in their nefarious undertakings. They were motivated by various factors such as attraction to Nazi ideology or material gain. Since the Swedes were neutral in World War II, Larson was indeed, as Mrs. Braun points out, a willing collaborator. At the time, he was the leader (fuehrer) of the group.21

00:35:15.464 --> 00:35:16.459
David Boder: By whom?

00:35:16.459 --> 00:35:35.914
Anna Braun: He was arrested by the Americans, who tried and sentenced him to 12 years in prison; and later he was sentenced by a Swedish court also to 12 years imprisonment, so in total a sentence of twenty-four years.

00:35:35.914 --> 00:35:39.914
David Boder: Well, so he simply abandoned you.

00:35:39.914 --> 00:35:41.596
Anna Braun: He abandoned us.

00:35:41.596 --> 00:35:45.375
David Boder: What happened then? The people in the village wouldn’t accept you?

00:35:45.375 --> 00:36:29.719
Anna Braun: The people of the village would not let us in. We went to the mayor. Also to the lager
                        fuehrer because there was a lager in that village, but neither the lager
                        fuehrer nor the mayor would take us in. We sat on the street with the little belongings that we still had. We were all wet. It poured, but still our pleading was of no avail, and since I was the senior among them I had to go plead everywhere while the whole party sat on the street and wept[here she herself weeps]

00:36:29.719 --> 00:36:31.508
David Boder: [After a pause]Were there men and women?

00:36:31.508 --> 00:36:40.238
Anna Braun: [Still sobbing]There were only women except for one man who had lost a leg.

00:36:40.238 --> 00:36:42.359
David Boder: Well.

00:36:42.359 --> 00:36:55.214
Anna Braun: It was a young man who we were forced to pick up on the road. He did no belong to our firm nor to its personnel. We simply picked him up.

00:36:55.214 --> 00:36:59.900
David Boder: Were all the people on the trucks Mennonites?

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:00.820
Anna Braun: No.

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:02.725
David Boder: Who were they?

00:37:02.725 --> 00:37:11.006
Anna Braun: They were people from Russia, from Leningrad.

00:37:11.006 --> 00:37:12.112
David Boder: Christians?

00:37:12.112 --> 00:37:14.549
Anna Braun: Christians, yes.

00:37:14.549 --> 00:37:21.710
David Boder: Well, what happened afterwards in that village? Did the people in that village know that the Americans were coming?

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:24.027
Anna Braun: The people in the village knew the Americans were coming.

00:37:24.027 --> 00:37:25.123
David Boder: And still they wouldn’t accept you?

00:37:25.123 --> 00:37:54.982
Anna Braun: And still they didn’t want to have anything to do with us. We remained there still the whole day on the street in the rain. Time and again we went to the mayor and pleaded. Finally we asked him to give us at least shelter in the school building. So he told us he expects a great deal of military men and the school already has been billeted. All houses are already billeted. There is no room for us, for twenty-two people.

00:37:54.982 --> 00:37:56.263
David Boder: You mean twenty-two women?

00:37:56.263 --> 00:37:58.354
Anna Braun: Twenty-two women.

00:37:58.354 --> 00:38:00.299
David Boder: Was your daughter with you?

00:38:00.299 --> 00:38:44.132
Anna Braun: Both of my children were with me. Almost on our knees we begged that man and finally in the evening, because he was afraid that we may come to his home, he told us we may go into the school building until the military arrives. ‘But should the military arrive even in the middle of the night I shall throw you out of the school building.’ So we went into the school. And sure enough the soldiers came at night but they did not disturb us in our room until the next morning at 10:00. The next morning at 10:00 they threw us out.

00:38:44.132 --> 00:39:10.962
David Boder: This concludes Spool 133, a report of Mrs. Anna Braun, a Mennonite widow whose husband perished or was executed in Russia. Mrs. Braun interrupted the discussion quite frequently, swallowing tears and suppressing sobs. She also weeps now. We are continuing on Spool 134.The post traumatic stress exhibited by Mrs. Braun was due to her harrowing experiences both prior to and during the war. Understandably, it was not uncommon among postwar refugees.22

00:39:10.962 --> 00:40:08.798
David Boder: Munich, September the 20th, 1946. This is Spool 134 a continuation of Spool 133 giving the story of a Mennonite woman, Mrs. Anna Braun, age 40, a widow, who went throught the war first on the shores of the [?], and then came to Germany and was employed, or forced labor at technical drawing. And we are in the middle of the story where they were abandoned by their escorts when the Americans approached. And where, in a little German town where they could not get any accomodation until finally they were allowed to sleep over in a school. And we are now at what happened the next morning.

00:40:08.798 --> 00:40:11.979
David Boder: And so, what happened the next day?

00:40:11.979 --> 00:40:33.090
Anna Braun: The next morning at 10 o’clock we were thrown out of the school building. The mayor did that. So we went again to a lager where we found numerous refugees. Here we were finally accepted.

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:36.417
David Boder: Who were those refugees in the lager?

00:40:36.417 --> 00:40:43.576
Anna Braun: Most of them were refugees from Jugoslavia.

00:40:43.576 --> 00:40:46.682
David Boder: What happened then?

00:40:46.682 --> 00:41:06.587
Anna Braun: There we spent three days. We were admitted “as guests” and so for three days we got no food and finally this lager also had to be vacated because they needed this place too for the Military.

00:41:06.587 --> 00:41:08.235
David Boder: Where was it? Sixty miles from Munich?

00:41:08.235 --> 00:41:09.803
Anna Braun: That was fifty miles from Munich.

00:41:09.803 --> 00:41:11.321
David Boder: What was the name of the city?

00:41:11.321 --> 00:41:32.828
Anna Braun: Heilenbach, near Rosenheim. It is really not a city but a most beautiful spot in Bavaria. A nice corner in the mountains. From here we also were to be thrown out because they needed the place for a German field hospital.

00:41:32.828 --> 00:41:34.869
David Boder: Now what kind of refugees were there?

00:41:34.869 --> 00:41:38.693
Anna Braun: There were refugees from Jugoslavia and Roumania.

00:41:38.693 --> 00:41:42.462
David Boder: Not workers, not deported people?

00:41:42.462 --> 00:41:47.462
Anna Braun: Yes. They were all deported people [Verschlepte Personnen].Verschleppen is the German word for “displaced.”23

00:41:47.462 --> 00:41:48.688
David Boder: No Jews?

00:41:48.688 --> 00:41:49.684
Anna Braun: No Jews.

00:41:49.684 --> 00:41:51.920
David Boder: Go on.

00:41:51.920 --> 00:42:31.292
Anna Braun: Then the Germans field hospital arrived. They stayed here for some time. We were crowded together into a few rooms. So far they didn’t throw us out. It was to happen every day. But then the Americans arrived, the American soldiers. The American soldiers took immediate command over the field hospital and they gave orders that we should not be thrown out.

00:42:31.292 --> 00:42:35.548
David Boder: What kind of soldiers were there? Were they on foot? In tanks? On trucks? Who were they?

00:42:35.548 --> 00:43:07.856
Anna Braun: They were in tanks and automobiles. Only a few automobiles arrived. Altogether maybe five or six automobiles. That’s all that came to this place. They took charge of the lager and soon afterwards we got—we did not get any ration cards, these were given to the lager authority, and we were given general maintenance right there in the lager.

00:43:07.856 --> 00:43:12.675
David Boder: Did you have any money on you?

00:43:12.675 --> 00:43:15.742
Anna Braun: Oh, we had very little money.

00:43:15.742 --> 00:43:19.395
David Boder: Were you paid for your work in Neustadt?

00:43:19.395 --> 00:43:19.978
Anna Braun: Yes.

00:43:19.978 --> 00:43:23.017
David Boder: What were they paying you?

00:43:23.017 --> 00:43:32.950
Anna Braun: I as a technical draftswoman received 180 marks a month.

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:34.744
David Boder: Including maintenance?

00:43:34.744 --> 00:43:39.262
Anna Braun: Food and lodging were extra.

00:43:39.262 --> 00:43:40.121
David Boder: You had to pay?

00:43:40.121 --> 00:43:41.659
Anna Braun: I paid for my maintenance and lodging.

00:43:41.659 --> 00:43:50.284
David Boder: Well. So you remained in the lager which was taken over by the Americans.

00:43:50.284 --> 00:43:50.797
Anna Braun: Yes.

00:43:50.797 --> 00:43:54.435
David Boder: And who managed then the lager?

00:43:54.435 --> 00:44:25.225
Anna Braun: As long as the field hospital was there it was the field hospital that also managed the lager because the lager
                        fuehrer who was there at the time when we arrived was immediately arrested. He was immediately arrested and we never saw him again. And so the lager was managed for four weeks by the field hospital. When the field hospital moved away—

00:44:25.225 --> 00:44:27.451
David Boder: Was it an American hospital?

00:44:27.451 --> 00:44:31.381
Anna Braun: No, that was a German hospital. And this German hospital—

00:44:31.381 --> 00:44:34.642
David Boder: Yes. And this German hospital, the German nurses and German doctors all stayed with it?

00:44:34.642 --> 00:44:39.818
Anna Braun: For the time being they stayed with it. And they also took care of us.

00:44:39.818 --> 00:44:43.175
David Boder: Well. Now, how did they behave after the Americans arrived?

00:44:43.175 --> 00:44:49.195
Anna Braun: Oh. After the arrival of the Americans they behaved very well[a pause]

00:44:49.195 --> 00:45:04.580
David Boder: Tell me, Mrs. Braun, you speak German well. Did you ever discuss matters with the Germans, before liberation, after liberation? What did they think about the whole situation?

00:45:04.580 --> 00:46:13.705
Anna Braun: There were among the Germans very different people. As far as I could understand at the beginning the Germans—at least many of them, probably most of them—had quite a different opinion about the events. But gradually they were so influenced by the fuehrer and his followers that they were gradually compelled to arrive at the belief that that may possibly be the right way. However, there were whispers. I knew quite a few Germans who told me: ‘we have no faith in it. We have no faith in it. But we must believe in it. We force ourselves to believe in it and we imagine that we do.’ Real sincere followers the fuehrer had but few.The indifference of the majority of the German population to the heinous crimes of the Nazis, especially the Holocaust, was a major enabling factor. 24

00:46:13.705 --> 00:46:29.414
David Boder: Now if the fuehrer had so few sincere followers how do you explain then—you know what happened to the Jews, the lagers—how do you explain that?

00:46:29.414 --> 00:47:27.486
Anna Braun: I often asked the German soldiers, ‘How can one do such things?’ I mean for example, Jews. I never could stop brooding over this question. And time and again I would ask that question. Just as I could not reconcile with the Heil Hitler salute, I never could understand it, because we as Mennonites were deeply religious and in our Lord’s Prayer it says ‘Holy be thy name’ (geheilegt werde dein Name) which meant that Heil may be applied only to the name of God. And so would I say, ‘How could you sanctify the name of the fuehrer? That is wrong. And so it is wrong the way you treat the Jews, murdering the Jews, who are the chosen people.’The Mennonites and some other Protestant sects regarded the Jews as “the apple of God’s eyes” due their regard for and understanding of the Hebrew Bible.25

00:47:27.486 --> 00:47:31.265
David Boder: Did you know what was happening to the Jews?

00:47:31.265 --> 00:47:33.629
Anna Braun: Who, I? Indeed.

00:47:33.629 --> 00:47:35.066
David Boder: How did you know?

00:47:35.066 --> 00:47:44.156
Anna Braun: Because in the region where we lived there were also many Jews. And the Jews would also dissapear.

00:47:44.156 --> 00:47:46.669
David Boder: You mean in the region of Neustadt where you lived?

00:47:46.669 --> 00:47:51.056
Anna Braun: No, about this region I know but little, I have in mind Russia.

00:47:51.056 --> 00:47:53.966
David Boder: You mean to say that while you were still in Russia they have taken away the Jews?

00:47:53.966 --> 00:48:58.558
Anna Braun: Yes. During the time we were still in Russia the Jews were taken away by the Germans and many German soldiers were telling us what they were doing to the Jews. We even had such a case. In general the Mennonites are not permitted to marry outside of their group from among other people, from other religions. But because among us one Mennonite woman had married a Jew so she had a child from that Jew. So I know this story for example definitely for certain. About the other things I just know from hearsay, what happened to the Jews and one wouldn’t know should believe it, things were really so horrible. But about this woman from whom they have taken away the child because it had a Jew for its father and that the child was killed, that we know, and we knew through it what they have been doing to the Jews[she begins to sob] The child was poisoned.Indeed, the crimes of the Holocaust were so despicable and so irrational as to be initially “beyond belief” even for many Jews.26

00:48:58.558 --> 00:49:01.805
David Boder: How come? Did the woman really know that for sure?

00:49:01.805 --> 00:49:17.323
Anna Braun: For the moment she did not know that they were poisoning her child, but the German soldiers came to her home and they had orders. There were among them such who also had a heart.

00:49:17.323 --> 00:49:19.147
David Boder: Yes.

00:49:19.147 --> 00:50:22.913
Anna Braun: And they came to fetch the child. It was a darling little blond curly baby with long hair. A beautiful baby girl, and when they came to fetch the child some of the German soldiers said, ‘I can’t do it. I can’t take away a child from the mother.’ But one day—the mother would not surrender the child—so one day they called for the mother in an automobile. They took her with the child to Zaporozhe. Then on the trip to Zaporozhe they poisoned the child. Somehow they did something under her nose. They touched her with the fingers. The woman didn’t notice it, but all at once there she stands with a stiff, dead child in her arms. [Here follows a long crying spell].It is unclear how the baby was murdered, but the Germans used all sorts of deceptions and diabolical methods in carrying out their murderous actions.27

00:50:22.913 --> 00:50:25.124
David Boder: Has the woman returned?

00:50:25.124 --> 00:50:43.384
Anna Braun: [Through tears] Yes, the woman came back. I think she was brought back sick and for weeks she lay sick at home. They didn’t let her take the child.

00:50:43.384 --> 00:50:46.012
David Boder: Did she have a chance to bury the child?

00:50:46.012 --> 00:50:47.831
Anna Braun: So far as I know, no.[a pause]

00:50:47.831 --> 00:50:57.624
David Boder: Now you stayed for about a month with the German Red Cross. What happened afterwards?

00:50:57.624 --> 00:51:54.877
Anna Braun: Then the German soldiers were demobilized or sent away somewhere that I don’t know. And the deportees and refugees remained alone in the lager. And so these refugees and deportees elected a man and there comes a new mayor to the town and he ordered that this man should now be in charge of the lager, he should handle the administration, and that a new chef should be chosen for the kitchen or be appointed. And so I too was assigned to the lager kitchen as second cook. And so I did the cooking for nine months.

00:51:54.877 --> 00:51:59.008
David Boder: Who provided the supplies?

00:51:59.008 --> 00:52:08.436
Anna Braun: The economic authority was in charge of providing supplies.

00:52:08.436 --> 00:52:14.602
David Boder: Was that a German economic authority or were you getting the supplies already from the Americans?

00:52:14.602 --> 00:52:18.094
Anna Braun: No. We were already getting our supplies from the Americans.

00:52:18.094 --> 00:52:20.265
David Boder: Was it already the UNRRA?

00:52:20.265 --> 00:53:24.791
Anna Braun: That was not the UNRRA, no. Then after nine months—we worked there for nine months but we did not get any money for it. Sure, we got our maintenance free. We worked in the lager without monetary pay. I worked from early in the morning until late at night. Since we had no more money, all our money was gone; we had no money whatsoever; and we needed money for shoes, clothes, for repairs and such other things. I told my daughter, ‘We can’t stay any more in the lager. We have to look for work somewhere where we are officially employed so that we could earn something.’ And so we went to the employment service and we were given jobs, nine kilometers away from Heilenbach, in a soap factory. But since I suffer from a heart ailment...

00:53:24.791 --> 00:53:27.736
David Boder: Since when do you suffer from a heart ailment?

00:53:27.736 --> 00:54:20.352
Anna Braun: Already for twenty years. And since I had to work standing on my feet and since I could not stand for long stretches of time, I worked only for half a day. But I got swelled feet from standing and it became obvious to me that I can’t continue with this work. But our wages were not enough to live on. I together with my daughter earned twenty-six marks weekly and we spent on food alone twenty-eight marks. And so again no money was left for the repair of shoes and the kind.

00:54:20.352 --> 00:54:32.860
David Boder: Will you tell me, what is the cost of living in Germany if one lives on his own. For example, what could you buy for twenty-six marks? What does the German pay for bread?

00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:53.356
Anna Braun: With twenty-six marks one has to buy only his ration cards. One can’t buy anything directly from the peasants. One can buy only those things which are being sold on ration stamps.The information supplied here by Mrs. Braun reflects the straightened circumstances in not only the displaced persons but also the vast majority of the German population faced in the immediate postwar period.28

00:54:53.356 --> 00:54:57.512
David Boder: Does that mean that the German peasants sell on the black market, is that so?

00:54:57.512 --> 00:54:58.442
Anna Braun: Yes.

00:54:58.442 --> 00:54:59.924
David Boder: The German peasants run a black market?

00:54:59.924 --> 00:55:01.573
Anna Braun: Yes.

00:55:01.573 --> 00:55:08.794
David Boder: And for what do they sell their products? For money, or what do they take?

00:55:08.794 --> 00:55:42.232
Anna Braun: We never went to the peasants because we had no money. One can buy from them only for very big money and one can get everything. That should not be so but on the black one can get everything. At least then it was so. And we worked in that soap factory only a short time, about a month and a half. Then we received word from our relatives.

00:55:42.232 --> 00:55:43.061
David Boder: Where from?

00:55:43.061 --> 00:55:50.256
Anna Braun: From Munich. They were located here in this lager in the Funkenkaserne[the army of the signal corps]

00:55:50.256 --> 00:55:54.468
David Boder: How did you happen to get the word? How did that come to be?

00:55:54.468 --> 00:55:56.614
Anna Braun: We received a telegram.

00:55:56.614 --> 00:55:59.192
David Boder: How did they know where you were?

00:55:59.192 --> 00:56:39.776
Anna Braun: We learned already that our relatives were on a farm in a small village. This information we had received already. And all at once we received a telegram from Munich, ‘We are here in Munich at the Funkenkaserne.’ We learned that there was in Munich an immigration lager, and since we from times before had the intention to immigrate to America our relatives came immediately here to Munich and sent immediately a telegram so that we too should come here.

00:56:39.776 --> 00:56:46.262
David Boder: Oh, yes. Now tell me; where to you plan to go?

00:56:46.262 --> 00:56:49.167
Anna Braun: We want to go to British Columbia, to Canada.Canada had accepted a significant number of Mennonite refugees in the 1920s and became the preferred destination for some in the postwar period.29

00:56:49.167 --> 00:56:50.438
David Boder: Who do you have there?

00:56:50.438 --> 00:56:55.879
Anna Braun: There I have the brothers of my husband. My husband has there three brothers.

00:56:55.879 --> 00:57:01.839
David Boder: What is the name of the city in British Columbia? Do you know where they are?

00:57:01.839 --> 00:57:04.223
Anna Braun: Coch [she hesitates].

00:57:04.223 --> 00:57:11.291
David Boder: Well? Never mind. Are there many Mennonites?

00:57:11.291 --> 00:57:13.557
Anna Braun: In Canada there are many Mennonites.

00:57:13.557 --> 00:57:14.804
David Boder: And in British Columbia?

00:57:14.804 --> 00:57:16.789
Anna Braun: In British Columbia there are also many.

00:57:16.789 --> 00:57:23.337
David Boder: Tell me, have you already made contact with them? Have they sent you affadavits?

00:57:23.337 --> 00:57:39.838
Anna Braun: Yes. We have already received the papers. And my brother-in-law who made the arrangements wrote us in a letter that he has already made a down payment on our passage and they hope that we will be there by Christmas.

00:57:39.838 --> 00:57:42.346
David Boder: Why should it take so long?

00:57:42.346 --> 00:57:58.386
Anna Braun: The arrangements for immigration in Canada are still not entirely completed. The separate provinces are willing to permit it but it is still not yet ...[she searches for words]

00:57:58.386 --> 00:57:59.000
David Boder: Not yet completely approved.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.558
Anna Braun: Not yet approved.

00:58:00.558 --> 00:58:10.397
David Boder: Now tell me, this is a somewhat personal question. You were all this time together with your step-daughter. How were you getting along?

00:58:10.397 --> 00:58:18.971
Anna Braun: We are on very good terms. We are getting along very well and we should not like to be separated.

00:58:18.971 --> 00:58:26.783
David Boder: Well, Mrs. Braun, is there anything that you would like to tell us more?

00:58:26.783 --> 00:59:23.808
Anna Braun: I can only add: We were four siblings. From these four I am the only one who remains. My brother was also in 1935 condemned to death by the GPU. He too spent two months in the death cell of Dnepropetrovsk. After we have tried everything. After we have given all our possessions to the lawyers that they should try everything in order to at least have the death sentence commuted. In this we succeeded and the sentence was commuted to twenty-five years imprisonement. However, in two years my brother died in prison.The Cheka, OGPU, NKVD, MVD and KGB were all acronyms for the Soviet secret police.30

00:59:23.808 --> 00:59:27.612
David Boder: What for was he sentenced? Not because he was a Mennonite?

00:59:27.612 --> 01:00:07.485
Anna Braun: No. But he was elected to the council on the parish. And because there was no freedom of religion. At the end we were not permitted to follow our religion and my brother up to the end was repeatedly making attempts to get for us the permission to hold church services and for that reason he disappeared one day. More we were unable to learn about him. Later it was said he was accused of the possession of a radio because his radio was taken away right with his arrest.

01:00:07.485 --> 01:00:09.938
David Boder: Was it not permitted to have a radio?

01:00:09.938 --> 01:01:03.646
Anna Braun: It was not prohibited officially but from the Mennonites all the radio sets were taken away. And from my brother they took it at the moment of his arrest. And so he died after two years imprisonment. But earlier, 1935, we still could write letters to each other, to the prison. As I told you before, among us Mennonites it was not permitted to marry with people of another nationality or religion, but my sister, my younger sister married a Tartar. He was an engineer and was assigned to work between Leningrad and Onega Lake. They were building there the functions in the systems of canals.

01:01:03.646 --> 01:01:04.490
David Boder: Near Leningrad?

01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:06.983
Anna Braun: Near Leningrad. There he was working.

01:01:06.983 --> 01:01:08.807
David Boder: And what lake did you mention?

01:01:08.807 --> 01:01:10.023
Anna Braun: Onega Lake.

01:01:10.023 --> 01:01:11.420
David Boder: Oh. Onega Lake.

01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:13.410
Anna Braun: Onegskoe Ozero.

01:01:13.410 --> 01:01:17.983
David Boder: Oh, yes. Onegskoe Ozero. How well you pronounce it in Russian.[They both laugh heartily]Onezhskoye Ozero is a large lake northeast of St. Petersburg (then Leningrad). Bratke (sp.?), which Mrs. Braun mentions in connection with her sister, could not be identified. [???]31

01:01:17.983 --> 01:01:31.481
Anna Braun: Yes. And since then I know nothing about my sister, nothing about her whereabouts. Then there was my other sister. She too was away in Bartke[?]

01:01:31.481 --> 01:01:39.538
David Boder: Where is that?

01:01:39.538 --> 01:02:11.125
Anna Braun: In Poland. And afterwards we were unable to find her, but through America we have now received from her a postcard. She has written a postcard from Siberia to America and our relatives in America have copied for us the postcard and sent it to us and that is how we know the address of my sister.

01:02:11.125 --> 01:02:14.617
David Boder: Well, she was not deported to Siberia?

01:02:14.617 --> 01:02:15.592
Anna Braun: We don’t know.

01:02:15.592 --> 01:02:18.406
David Boder: Life in Siberia as such is not so bad.

01:02:18.406 --> 01:02:20.999
Anna Braun: Oh, no. It is not bad.

01:02:20.999 --> 01:02:30.154
David Boder: Well, that is fortunate. Oh, yes. She was in Poland and so many from Poland were evacuated to Siberia. That is very possible. Many who survived were evacuated to Siberia.

01:02:30.154 --> 01:02:34.953
Anna Braun: And so we don’t know why she has been sent there.

01:02:34.953 --> 01:02:41.963
David Boder: Now tell me how do you live here in the lager? How many Mennonites are here in the lager and how do you live here?

01:02:41.963 --> 01:02:52.451
Anna Braun: We are here about six hundred Mennonites.

01:02:52.451 --> 01:02:55.627
David Boder: About how many men, women and children?

01:02:55.627 --> 01:03:07.204
Anna Braun: [Hesitantly]We have here about 300 to 350 children.

01:03:07.204 --> 01:03:07.901
David Boder: Is that so?

01:03:07.901 --> 01:03:19.303
Anna Braun: The rest are women and men. Among them mostly women. The number of men is relatively small.

01:03:19.303 --> 01:03:24.112
David Boder: Tell me approximately how many women are here with their husbands?

01:03:24.112 --> 01:03:32.801
Anna Braun: We have here very few women with their husbands. We have here either women without their husbands or men without their wives.

01:03:32.801 --> 01:03:37.155
David Boder: Did any marriages take place here?

01:03:37.155 --> 01:03:38.607
Anna Braun: Yes. One marriage.

01:03:38.607 --> 01:03:39.361
David Boder: Only one case of marriage?

01:03:39.361 --> 01:03:40.879
Anna Braun: Only one.

01:03:40.879 --> 01:03:45.748
David Boder: Now, and how do you live in a block or do you have a house for yourself?

01:03:45.748 --> 01:03:48.047
Anna Braun: Yes, we live here in a block.

01:03:48.047 --> 01:03:51.409
David Boder: You see I have no time really to visit the place and that is why I am asking you about it.

01:03:51.409 --> 01:04:01.017
Anna Braun: Yes. Most of the Mennonites live here in block 8. The rest live in block number 24, and in block number 6.

01:04:01.017 --> 01:04:09.409
David Boder: Now, how do you live there in block 8? Are these large rooms? How many people are you in one room?

01:04:09.409 --> 01:04:19.827
Anna Braun: Our rooms are from thirty to forty square meters and in one room there live about twelve people.

01:04:19.827 --> 01:04:21.068
David Boder: Do you mean women and men?

01:04:21.068 --> 01:04:32.826
Anna Braun: Men and women together. But we have arranged the rooms by means of beds in such a fashion that the men and women.....

01:04:32.826 --> 01:04:33.479
David Boder: ...are separated?

01:04:33.479 --> 01:04:34.183
Anna Braun: ...separated.

01:04:34.183 --> 01:04:36.168
David Boder: What do you have, curtains?

01:04:36.168 --> 01:04:51.706
Anna Braun: Yes. Every room is first of all partitioned by means of those tall double level beds and then we have the corners partitioned off by means of blankets. We live here in this lager very well.

01:04:51.706 --> 01:04:55.590
David Boder: And who takes care of the food supply here?

01:04:55.590 --> 01:05:00.951
Anna Braun: Among us Mennonites all capable to work are working.

01:05:00.951 --> 01:05:02.122
David Boder: Are they being paid?

01:05:02.122 --> 01:05:15.306
Anna Braun: Yes. They get better maintenance, better food. They get their working men’s card. They get also a card for working. They get also a card for clothing.

01:05:15.306 --> 01:05:17.819
David Boder: With such a clothing card, where do they buy their clothes?

01:05:17.819 --> 01:05:31.603
Anna Braun: They get their food and their clothing without pay. Every month the person who works gets two pieces of clothing and on the clothing card they then mark down what one has recieved.

01:05:31.603 --> 01:05:33.095
David Boder: Are you working?

01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:44.518
Anna Braun: Yes. I work but I am working in the social service department. I work for charity, I don’t get any pay.

01:05:44.518 --> 01:05:46.151
David Boder: Is your daughter working?

01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:50.000
Anna Braun: Yes. My daughter is a kindergarten teacher.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.544
David Boder: And your daughter has a working card?

01:05:52.544 --> 01:05:58.283
Anna Braun: Yes. She has a working card and for her work she gets cigarettes.

01:05:58.283 --> 01:05:58.746
David Boder: Cigarettes?

01:05:58.746 --> 01:06:00.369
Anna Braun: Yes. [They both laugh]

01:06:00.369 --> 01:06:02.419
David Boder: How many cigarettes does she get?

01:06:02.419 --> 01:06:11.800
Anna Braun: She gets....before it was more, now it is somewhat less. At present she gets 10 packages per month.

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:13.559
David Boder: That is 200 cigarettes per month.

01:06:13.559 --> 01:06:14.082
Anna Braun: Yes.

01:06:14.082 --> 01:06:15.072
David Boder: Does she smoke?

01:06:15.072 --> 01:06:15.750
Anna Braun: No.

01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:20.564
David Boder: Will you tell me then. What does one do with those cigarettes?

01:06:20.564 --> 01:06:31.341
Anna Braun: With the cigarettes one can do all kinds of things. Let us say we want to repair our shoes. We have no money, so we pay with cigarettes.

01:06:31.341 --> 01:06:35.436
David Boder: Oh, yes. And how many cigarettes do you give for a pair of soles on shoes?

01:06:35.436 --> 01:06:42.410
Anna Braun: I can’t tell you that exactly. A package of cigarettes for a pair of soles.

01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:44.465
David Boder: And that includes the leather?

01:06:44.465 --> 01:06:48.405
Anna Braun: Yes, everything.

01:06:48.405 --> 01:06:56.855
David Boder: That is very interesting. Now tell me, what do then the other people do with the cigarettes? Who finally smokes the cigarettes, if everybody uses them to trade?

01:06:56.855 --> 01:07:05.689
Anna Braun: The men do smoke the cigarettes. The Mennonite women do not smoke. This is prohibited by the religion.

01:07:05.689 --> 01:07:07.418
David Boder: But you get your cigarettes?

01:07:07.418 --> 01:07:08.252
Anna Braun: Yes.

01:07:08.252 --> 01:07:11.850
David Boder: Do the other inhabitants of the lager get any cigarettes?

01:07:11.850 --> 01:07:16.980
Anna Braun: No. Those who do not work do not get any cigarettes.

01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:39.633
David Boder: Well, Mrs. Braun, it was a great satisfaction to talk with you. You threw in here and there a sentence in Russian and you speak such a wonderful Russian I almost think we should have made the recording in Russian. But there are more people in [America who understand German]. What did you say?

01:07:39.633 --> 01:07:44.448
Anna Braun: I speak German [?], but I lack somewhat in confidence with the Russian language.

01:07:44.448 --> 01:07:48.096
David Boder: Yes. At school of course you studied in Russian?

01:07:48.096 --> 01:07:50.167
Anna Braun: Yes, Russian, and German as well.

01:07:50.167 --> 01:07:57.333
David Boder: Well, I thank you very much. I am sure you have given me some important material and I indeed appreciate you patience.

01:07:57.333 --> 01:07:58.212
Anna Braun: You are welcome.

01:07:58.212 --> 01:08:31.934
David Boder: This concludes Spool 134, at 25 indicator minutes: an interview with Mrs. Anna Braun, the Mennonite widow of the age of 40 who is now here at the Funkenkaserne in Munich. She is a member of a Mennonite colony of 500 people. Illinois Institute of Technology wire recording.
