David Boder: Early in ’44, hmhm?

00:22:10.573 --> 00:22:17.432
Eda Button: Later my, my eh, mother-in-law...

00:22:17.432 --> 00:22:18.526
David Boder: Mother-in-law, yes.

00:22:18.526 --> 00:22:18.901
Eda Button: Mother-in-law...

00:22:18.901 --> 00:22:20.276
David Boder: Your, your husband’s mother.

00:22:20.276 --> 00:22:23.010
Eda Button: Husband’s mother and my in-law, eh...

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:25.259
David Boder: Sister-in-law.

00:22:25.259 --> 00:22:31.213
Eda Button: Father. My father-in-law. They were hiding in a village. My father-in-law was 80 years old...

00:22:31.213 --> 00:22:31.743
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:31.743 --> 00:22:36.009
Eda Button: and my mother-in-law was, eh, 70 years old.

00:22:36.009 --> 00:22:36.478
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:36.478 --> 00:22:43.477
Eda Button: And they ran away from village to village. Because they were of, from Greece and they knew the language very well...

00:22:43.477 --> 00:22:43.977
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:43.977 --> 00:22:48.086
Eda Button: . . . the Greek language. And in this way, they managed to save themselves.

00:22:48.086 --> 00:22:48.649
David Boder: Hmhm?

00:22:48.649 --> 00:22:49.837
Eda Button: And they came in Athens.

00:22:49.837 --> 00:22:50.415
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:50.415 --> 00:22:54.290
Eda Button: And we all, all lived together at, eh, my sister-in-law.

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:54.884
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:54.884 --> 00:23:04.477
Eda Button: Then, one day we heard that this man, who came to us, was, eh, was on the side of the Germans.

00:23:04.477 --> 00:23:05.211
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:05.211 --> 00:23:18.038
Eda Button: And, eh, I, I, we were afraid my husband and I and we ran away to another in-law, eh, sister-in-law...

00:23:18.038 --> 00:23:19.288
David Boder: To another sister-in-law.

00:23:19.288 --> 00:23:24.959
Eda Button: . . . sister-in-law, sister-in-law, who also lived in Athens in another quarter.

00:23:24.959 --> 00:23:27.475
David Boder: Yes, hmhm?

00:23:27.475 --> 00:23:31.287
Eda Button: And my mother-in-law stayed with the other sister-in-law.

00:23:31.287 --> 00:23:32.068
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:32.068 --> 00:23:41.739
Eda Button: And, the Jewish man, he reproved a little, how does one say?

00:23:41.739 --> 00:23:42.645
David Boder: He was sorry?

00:23:42.645 --> 00:23:57.879
Eda Button: He was sorry, in the end. And he said to my mother-in-law, “You should, I don’t know what, the Germans know that you live in this house. And today the Germans will come and you...”

00:23:57.879 --> 00:23:58.535
David Boder: Take you away?

00:23:58.535 --> 00:23:59.098
Eda Button: Take away.

00:23:59.098 --> 00:24:02.394
David Boder: Did this Jewish man do anything bad to you?

00:24:02.394 --> 00:24:03.050
Eda Button: Yes.

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:04.113
David Boder: What did he do?

00:24:04.113 --> 00:24:15.737
Eda Button: Because I was afraid and I [no verb, only the auxiliary past tense form; probably she meant “gave”] him a little something that I had salvaged from Saloniki, linen and clothes and such, and I had to give everything to him and...

00:24:15.737 --> 00:24:16.659
David Boder: And run away?

00:24:16.659 --> 00:24:19.878
Eda Button: To, yes, run away. I had no house to stay and nothing.

00:24:19.878 --> 00:24:23.002
David Boder: And then he said to your mother-in-law...

00:24:23.002 --> 00:24:24.877
Eda Button: No, he said to my in-law...

00:24:24.877 --> 00:24:25.971
David Boder: Mother-in-law?

00:24:25.971 --> 00:24:27.643
Eda Button: Said to my brother-in-law...

00:24:27.643 --> 00:24:28.456
David Boder: To your brother-in-law.

00:24:28.456 --> 00:24:30.846
Eda Button: To my brother-in-law, also a lawyer...

00:24:30.846 --> 00:24:31.471
David Boder: Yes.

00:24:31.471 --> 00:24:33.534
Eda Button: . . . that the Germans would, eh...

00:24:33.534 --> 00:24:35.612
David Boder: Come?

00:24:35.612 --> 00:24:44.908
Eda Button: Come, come in the house. And he should save himself, run away. But the mother, because she was old, and the father could stay in the house.

00:24:44.908 --> 00:24:45.502
David Boder: Yes.

00:24:45.502 --> 00:24:55.486
Eda Button: But at the moment when my brother-in-law said this [given her faulty grammar, this could also mean “my brother-in-law was told this”], he came away from home and he told my in-law...

00:24:55.486 --> 00:24:55.767
David Boder: Father-in-law?

00:24:55.767 --> 00:24:59.267
Eda Button: Father-in-law, and my mother-in-law, who were still in the table...

00:24:59.267 --> 00:25:00.360
David Boder: [unintelligible]

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.485
Eda Button: . . . in the dining-room...

00:25:02.485 --> 00:25:03.281
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:03.281 --> 00:25:05.484
Eda Button: He told them [quickly?] they should...

00:25:05.484 --> 00:25:07.437
David Boder: Run away?

00:25:07.437 --> 00:25:22.452
Eda Button: . . . run away. And my father-in-law had no time to put on my jacket, something to wear, and my sister-in-law [again, she uses the wrong German word] and they ran away from the, the, the staircase in [unintelligible]...

00:25:22.452 --> 00:25:23.264
David Boder: In the back, yes.

00:25:23.264 --> 00:25:30.451
Eda Button: . . . in the back. And at the moment that they were, that they ran away they still let the lights on.

00:25:30.451 --> 00:25:30.983
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:30.983 --> 00:26:00.294
Eda Button: And then my brother-in-law [wrong German word again], he ran away with his wife. Then he went to the Jew who wanted to [unintelligible], had told him that they had already run away. And the Jew said, “And your mother ran away too?” Said he, “Yes, of course, could not save me and leave my mother and my father.” Said he, “What have you done? The Germans will understand that I have told you that they should run away.”

00:26:00.294 --> 00:26:01.544
David Boder: That was the Christian [possibly not “Christian” but “helpful”?] man?

00:26:01.544 --> 00:26:02.029
Eda Button: The Jew.

00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.498
David Boder: Yes.

00:26:02.498 --> 00:26:03.342
Eda Button: He was a Jew.

00:26:03.342 --> 00:26:05.670
David Boder: [surprised] Oh, he was a Jew who worked with the Germans?

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:06.576
Eda Button: Yes, yes, he was a Jew.

00:26:06.576 --> 00:26:07.169
David Boder: Yes.

00:26:07.169 --> 00:26:08.169
Eda Button: A Greek Jew.

00:26:08.169 --> 00:26:10.606
David Boder: A Greek Jew who worked with the Germans. So?

00:26:10.606 --> 00:26:33.231
Eda Button: And he said, “What have you done? The Germans will understand that I have you told you this and that we should have done [she probably means “and what we should have done”].” Then my brother-in-law said, “I could not leave my mother, my father, an eighty-year old human, leave them in so [unintelligible].” And then we ran away. Then we again, the, the, my brother-in-law and my sister-in-law, eh, not the brother-in-law...

00:26:33.231 --> 00:26:37.138
David Boder: Yes.

00:26:37.138 --> 00:26:37.730
Eda Button: the father-in-law...

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:38.182
David Boder: Yes.

00:26:38.182 --> 00:26:57.255
Eda Button: . . . my mother-in-law, they came to us where we had only a kitchen with two rooms, where we were already 6, 8 people. And, eh, one would lie in bed, on the floor, and this way we stayed some days.

00:26:57.255 --> 00:26:58.643
David Boder: Then, how were you deported?

00:26:58.643 --> 00:27:08.421
Eda Button: I was deported even though [unintelligible] my husband had said that I had to drive in [to] Barcelona.

00:27:08.421 --> 00:27:09.201
David Boder: Yes.

00:27:09.201 --> 00:27:20.148
Eda Button: And because the first group from Saloniki, of the Spanish group, was five [possibly “twelve”] months in Belsen, then they were from Frankfurt...

00:27:20.148 --> 00:27:20.413
David Boder: Yes.

00:27:20.413 --> 00:27:26.355
Eda Button: . . . they were in Barcelona, really in Barcelona, and we letters from them re—

00:27:26.355 --> 00:27:26.948
David Boder: Received?

00:27:26.948 --> 00:27:39.751
David Boder: Received that they were in Barcelona already. They told us that all Jews from, all Spanish Jews from Athens would drive straight to Barcelona again.

00:27:39.751 --> 00:27:40.266
David Boder: Yes.

00:27:40.266 --> 00:27:48.952
Eda Button: So my husband said to me, “Why do you want to hide yourself when [unintelligible], that your father just to Auschwitz was...

00:27:48.952 --> 00:27:50.371
David Boder: Sent?

00:27:50.371 --> 00:27:56.360
Eda Button: . . . sent. “Why do you want to do then, if you do not to, eh, Barcelona as well?”

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.046
David Boder: Yes.

00:27:57.046 --> 00:28:02.036
Eda Button: “You will stay in Barcelona for one month; the World War will be ended. . .”

00:28:02.036 --> 00:28:03.191
David Boder: Yes.

00:28:03.191 --> 00:28:13.842
Eda Button: “. . . and you will return.” And I was in Sunday, not Sunday, eh, [questioningly] dimanche [unintelligible]?

00:28:13.842 --> 00:28:14.404
David Boder: Yes, Monday.

00:28:14.404 --> 00:28:43.052
Eda Button: On Monday I was at the Spanish Consulate, and, to ask what the Spanish, what I must do. Because all Spaniards had been already classified, and all were already in the Jewish Community. And I was told on Sunday at nine o’clock you have, all must drive to Spain.

00:28:43.052 --> 00:28:44.347
David Boder: To Spain?

00:28:44.347 --> 00:28:45.298
Eda Button: Drive to Spain.

00:28:45.298 --> 00:28:45.688
David Boder: Yes.

00:28:45.688 --> 00:28:53.360
Eda Button: And I went to the Consulate to ask what I has to do, [corrects herself] had to do. There was a Catholic, eh, how does one say?

00:28:53.360 --> 00:29:01.781
David Boder: Priest? Minister?

00:29:01.781 --> 00:29:02.748
Eda Button: A, yes...

00:29:02.748 --> 00:29:03.387
David Boder: Padre?

00:29:03.387 --> 00:29:09.204
Eda Button: I said already. And he knew that my child was hidden in Saloniki.

00:29:09.204 --> 00:29:09.781
David Boder: Yes.

00:29:09.781 --> 00:29:27.709
Eda Button: And he said to me, “What do you have to be here for? [unintelligible] from one house to another. And it is better you should drive to Spain. There you will breathe fresh air and be free and one month later you will return.”

00:29:27.709 --> 00:29:28.365
David Boder: Yes.

00:29:28.365 --> 00:29:39.060
Eda Button: And in the end I also asked the consul. The consul told me, “It is the best for you, you have to drive to Spain.”

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:39.700
David Boder: Yes.

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:52.113
Eda Button: “In five days you will be in Barcelona and you will be free.” Then I came home, with the, the priest

00:29:52.113 --> 00:29:53.378
David Boder: With the priest?

00:29:53.378 --> 00:29:57.656
Eda Button: Yes, with the priest I came home. With the car of the...

00:29:57.656 --> 00:29:58.687
David Boder: Consulate?

00:29:58.687 --> 00:30:13.384
Eda Button: Consulate. I should take something, a valise, some clothes, get something for me. And I came home and I had no time to tell my husband that I will drive away. Because in a quarter of an hour [short break in the recording] already one had to be at the station because the train had to drive away.

00:30:13.384 --> 00:30:14.258
David Boder: Yes.

00:30:14.258 --> 00:31:33.082
Eda Button: Away. [Note: There is another break here, as if something is missing and she is backtracking a little bit] Consul, eh, I came home and my husband had no time, not even to hear what was up. I took a couple of things, no time, and I drove in the car with the Padre. We drove to, we again went to the consulate and the minister Spanish consul and his wife as well, was there, and, eh, he waited for us and we all together came to the station. At the station, I, eh, the car, eh, [unintelligible] arrêté [possibly she wants to know the German word for “arrêté,” meaning “remaining seated”]?

00:31:33.082 --> 00:31:33.910
David Boder: Went back?

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:34.425
Eda Button: No, [unintelligible].

00:31:34.425 --> 00:31:35.785
David Boder: Stayed [unintelligible].

00:31:35.785 --> 00:31:55.405
Eda Button: Yes, and I started to cry. I told the consul, “I do not want to drive away.” Said he, “No, the best is, because, you should drive to Spain. And in only one month the war is over and you will return.”

00:31:55.405 --> 00:31:56.437
David Boder: Yes.

00:31:56.437 --> 00:32:05.405
Eda Button: I prayed [asked] the Padre he should, he should take care for my child in, eh...

00:32:05.405 --> 00:32:07.014
David Boder: In the convent?

00:32:07.014 --> 00:32:14.342
Eda Button: . . . in Salonika. Yes, in the convent. Says he, “Yes, yes, you will be back and you can...”

00:32:14.342 --> 00:32:19.092
David Boder: [interrupts her] Now, [unintelligible], and how did you go away then?

00:32:19.092 --> 00:32:26.904
Eda Button: I came to the station and I started to walk.

00:32:26.904 --> 00:32:28.748
David Boder: And were there already other Jews there?

00:32:28.748 --> 00:32:47.903
Eda Button: No. We were not from the right side, we came from the other side. We didn’t know where the Spanish Jews were. Then we saw that all cars [railway cars] were barbelé, how does one say?

00:32:47.903 --> 00:32:49.012
David Boder: With wire?

00:32:49.012 --> 00:32:49.668
Eda Button: With wire.

00:32:49.668 --> 00:32:50.605
David Boder: With wire. Yes?

00:32:50.605 --> 00:33:00.683
Eda Button: And I did not see Jews, Jews. I did from the window with the wire...

00:33:00.683 --> 00:33:01.183
David Boder: Yes.

00:33:01.183 --> 00:33:12.589
Eda Button: I said, “This is now [unintelligible], are we allowed to travel? I am afraid and I want to go back to Athens. I do not want to travel. I do not want to go away.”

00:33:12.589 --> 00:33:13.355
David Boder: Yes.

00:33:13.355 --> 00:33:27.761
Eda Button: The wife of the Spanish consul then said to me, “You are right but the Germans said it wrong, we were told you have to with second class...”

00:33:27.761 --> 00:33:29.714
David Boder: In the second car?

00:33:29.714 --> 00:33:36.401
Eda Button: . . . drive in the second class Car. And the Germans us...

00:33:36.401 --> 00:33:52.744
David Boder: [In English] The spool ended and I am making an attachment so that this spool will have probably more than 33 minutes. The story is becoming interesting and I decided to continue.

00:33:52.744 --> 00:34:00.681
David Boder: [In German] So, say, you were there, start over again. Yes?

00:34:00.681 --> 00:34:16.838
Eda Button: I was at the station and I saw the Jews, who were [locked] into the car with wire. I was so scared that I started to cry. So I asked...

00:34:16.838 --> 00:34:18.447
David Boder: The wife of . ..

00:34:18.447 --> 00:34:31.760
Eda Button: I said to the wife of the Spanish consul, “Where are the second class cars? I cannot drive that way. And I want to back in Athens...

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.338
David Boder: to Athens?

00:34:33.338 --> 00:34:34.244
Eda Button: To Athens.

00:34:34.244 --> 00:34:34.728
David Boder: Yes.

00:34:34.728 --> 00:34:43.493
Eda Button: She said to me, “You are right, the Gestapo have said wrong. And you can, you can go back.”

00:34:43.493 --> 00:34:44.181
David Boder: Yes.

00:34:44.181 --> 00:34:53.728
Eda Button: And slowly, slowly I went, went back, and the consul with his wife, and his secretary and the Padre...

00:34:53.728 --> 00:34:54.884
David Boder: Yes.

00:34:54.884 --> 00:35:05.117
Eda Button: . . . went in the train to greet the Spanish group. Those who had to go away to Spain...

00:35:05.117 --> 00:35:06.054
David Boder: Yes.

00:35:06.054 --> 00:35:09.851
Eda Button: . . . were, to greet them at the last moment.”

00:35:09.851 --> 00:35:10.351
David Boder: Yes.

00:35:10.351 --> 00:35:13.038
Eda Button: And I was [unintelligible] in the car.

00:35:13.038 --> 00:35:14.038
David Boder: Yes.

00:35:14.038 --> 00:35:20.928
Eda Button: I didn’t know what to do because it was German police.

00:35:20.928 --> 00:35:21.600
David Boder: Yes.

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:26.897
Eda Button: And I thought, what shall I answer if they ask, request my papers.

00:35:26.897 --> 00:35:28.365
David Boder: Was there no chauffeur?

00:35:28.365 --> 00:35:36.568
Eda Button: Yes, the chauffeur was too, eh, he also went to greet the Spanish group.

00:35:36.568 --> 00:35:37.240
David Boder: Yes.

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.959
Eda Button: Because he known everybody. [She either means “Everybody had gone” or “He knew everybody”]

00:35:38.959 --> 00:35:39.615
David Boder: Yes.

00:35:39.615 --> 00:36:18.093
Eda Button: And I stayed. And then, eh, several minutes later the priest came back and he said to me, “Why are you here?” I said, “I am scared and I do not want to go. And I want to go back to Athens.” Then he said to me, “And, I will, you cannot stay outside here. The Germans can request your papers. Come into the car.” And I went, came into the car, I sat down. And I was so scared that the Germans will not request my papers.

00:36:18.093 --> 00:36:18.500
David Boder: Yes.

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:21.906
Eda Button: But since the Spanish flag was in the car...

00:36:21.906 --> 00:36:22.828
David Boder: Yes.

00:36:22.828 --> 00:36:26.202
Eda Button: . . . I thought that the Germans could not, eh...

00:36:26.202 --> 00:36:26.921
David Boder: Yes.

00:36:26.921 --> 00:36:37.952
Eda Button: . . . request my papers. And I was there, I waited. Several minutes later, I was so scared, I waited, that the, the consul and...

00:36:37.952 --> 00:36:39.452
David Boder: His wife?

00:36:39.452 --> 00:36:47.139
Eda Button: . . . greeting, yes, greeting the Spanish group and that he returns to bring me to Athens...

00:36:47.139 --> 00:36:49.014
David Boder: To bring you back?

00:36:49.014 --> 00:36:59.092
Eda Button: To bring me back. Several minutes later I see my brother coming. My brother, too, was in the train car with my old mother of eighty years.

00:36:59.092 --> 00:36:59.608
David Boder: Yes.

00:36:59.608 --> 00:37:01.295
Eda Button: As Spaniard, again.

00:37:01.295 --> 00:37:02.045
David Boder: Yes.

00:37:02.045 --> 00:37:13.248
Eda Button: And my brother came and he asked me why I stayed here and why, why...

00:37:13.248 --> 00:37:23.201
David Boder: [Apparently talking to somebody else in the background who disrupted the interview.]

00:37:23.201 --> 00:37:41.153
Eda Button: Why, my brother said to me, “Why do you stay here? The Padre told me that you were here and you came here, and you should drive to Spain with us. And when you want to go again to Athens...”

00:37:41.153 --> 00:37:42.122
David Boder: Return?

00:37:42.122 --> 00:37:45.294
Eda Button: “. . . want to return, eh, you will again be, eh...”

00:37:45.294 --> 00:37:48.044
David Boder: Betrayed?

00:37:48.044 --> 00:37:52.637
Eda Button: “. . . betrayed again, and then you will directly to Auschwitz...”

00:37:52.637 --> 00:37:53.668
David Boder: Go?

00:37:53.668 --> 00:38:03.995
Eda Button: . . . go.” And he said, “You have to come with us, we drive to Spain. We have a lot of bread in the train...”

00:38:03.995 --> 00:38:04.808
David Boder: Yes.

00:38:04.808 --> 00:38:20.276
Eda Button: “. . . and one has all the food of, of all the Jews have given money and they, they bought a lot of food. And we will make a very good journey. And you should not, eh...”

00:38:20.276 --> 00:38:34.494
David Boder: Be afraid?

00:38:34.494 --> 00:38:35.275
Eda Button: “. . . be afraid. You should join us.” He took my valise and we came. [unintelligible] I came to the train that I had seen, into the car with my mother, my old mother, and...

00:38:35.275 --> 00:38:35.275
David Boder: Where was your father?

00:38:35.275 --> 00:38:37.900
Eda Button: My father had long been dead. Regrettably.

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:39.463
David Boder: I see.

00:38:39.463 --> 00:38:52.264
Eda Button: And I saw my mother, and my brother and all the people that were in there. They were mostly the richest Jewish families in Greece.

00:38:52.264 --> 00:38:52.713
David Boder: Yes.

00:38:52.713 --> 00:38:58.538
Eda Button: And I saw all the people. I said, “What have I done, why have I come?”

00:38:58.538 --> 00:38:59.194
David Boder: Yes.

00:38:59.194 --> 00:39:11.443
Eda Button: But two minutes later the train already had to leave and I only had time to tell the Padre to look after my child.

00:39:11.443 --> 00:39:17.333
David Boder: Now, your [unintelligible]. To where, eh, where to were you taken?

00:39:17.333 --> 00:39:19.427
Eda Button: I was taken from Athens.

00:39:19.427 --> 00:39:20.583
David Boder: Where to, where to?

00:39:20.583 --> 00:39:23.379
Eda Button: In, to Bergen-Belsen. I was...

00:39:23.379 --> 00:39:24.488
David Boder: [interrupts] Not to Spain?

00:39:24.488 --> 00:39:29.738
Eda Button: No. It was wrong. We were told that we would to Spain but we drove in Bergen-Belsen.

00:39:29.738 --> 00:39:32.676
David Boder: I see. And how long were you in Bergen-Belsen?

00:39:32.676 --> 00:39:46.326
Eda Button: I was, eh, exactly, eh, from April 12, ’44, we went from Athens and we were in Bergen-Belsen after fourteen days with the...

00:39:46.326 --> 00:39:47.949
David Boder: [interrupts] Yes, and how long were you there?

00:39:47.949 --> 00:39:52.726
Eda Button: And we were until April 5, ’45...

00:39:52.726 --> 00:39:53.319
David Boder: ’45.

00:39:53.319 --> 00:39:55.208
Eda Button: . . . we were there, in Bergen-Belsen...

00:39:55.208 --> 00:39:59.360
David Boder: [interrupts] Now, tell, how did you get your child back here in Paris?

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:05.854
Eda Button: I was, we were so, so long in Belsen.

00:40:05.854 --> 00:40:12.394
David Boder: Yes.

00:40:12.394 --> 00:40:26.240
Eda Button: And we were, we had very poor food, eh...

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:36.059
David Boder: Yes.

00:40:36.059 --> 00:40:12.394
Eda Button: . . . and everything horrible and each month the, eh, German, eh, chief came and he told us, “a little patience, just a few days more,” and we would drive to Spain.

00:40:12.394 --> 00:40:36.059
David Boder: Yes. So, [unintelligible]. You say, the “Mother Superior” returned your child.

00:40:36.059 --> 00:40:36.496
Eda Button: Yes.

00:40:36.496 --> 00:40:38.026
David Boder: Who paid for your trip?

00:40:38.026 --> 00:41:01.770
Eda Button: I, I requested of, my husband wrote from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The Joint has to help us get our child. The Joint, a boss of, a director of the Joint sent me a letter...

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:01.770
David Boder: Yes.

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:26.091
Eda Button: . . . and I should come there. And, eh, the director said to me, “Do you want to drive to Greece to get your child?” I said, “No. I do not want to drive to Greece. I cannot see this, eh, country anymore. And I want to drive to Palestine to be free.”

00:41:26.091 --> 00:41:26.731
David Boder: And?

00:41:26.731 --> 00:41:57.124
Eda Button: So he told me, “How will you get your child?” So I said, “I am going to Palestine now because the Jewish Agence Palestinienne gave me a permit, and we all together, in a few days, will drive to, eh, Palestine. And from there I will try, with Greek papers, because I will again marry my husband...”

00:41:57.124 --> 00:41:57.592
David Boder: Yes.

00:41:57.592 --> 00:42:03.742
Eda Button: “. . . and I will have my Greek papers so that I will drive to Greece to get my child.”

00:42:03.742 --> 00:42:11.985
David Boder: I see. [unintelligible] Yet still the, the Sister Superior brought the child here. How did they return...

00:42:11.985 --> 00:42:26.424
Eda Button: [interrupts] Because I saw that the, the Agence Palestinienne in the last moment had taken my permit away because they received a telegram that my husband had sent me a permit, for me.

00:42:26.424 --> 00:42:27.580
David Boder: Yes.

00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:29.609
Eda Button: In the English Consulate.

00:42:29.609 --> 00:42:30.608
David Boder: Yes.

00:42:30.608 --> 00:42:40.801
Eda Button: And this permit that I had been given, was given in another woman, who now already [is?] in Palestine.

00:42:40.801 --> 00:42:41.332
David Boder: Yes.

00:42:41.332 --> 00:42:52.134
Eda Button: And I stayed here. And again I started telegramming in order to get my child. Because the director of Joint...

00:42:52.134 --> 00:42:53.071
David Boder: Yes.

00:42:53.071 --> 00:43:32.743
Eda Button: . . . uh, Mr. Grinley, wanted to drive to Greece. He went, and here the secretaries, they sent a telegram here that he should, when he returns, take, bring my child from, from the convent in Saloniki. And I sig—, signed papers that I give the authorization to get my child. And I was at the commissaire [commissariat?] and everything was alright. Then the sisters again did not give my child.

00:43:32.743 --> 00:43:33.118
David Boder: Why?

00:43:33.118 --> 00:43:45.597
Eda Button: Because the child was weak, they said. And she, the Superieure sent me a telegram that she herself wanted my child in August, bring my child in August.

00:43:45.597 --> 00:43:46.097
David Boder: Yes.

00:43:46.097 --> 00:44:17.866
Eda Button: So I went to the, I went again to the director of Joint, and I said, “When they, in August I can, I already have a permit here maybe, and I can quickly drive to Palestine. And do you want, eh, the Sister brings my child earlier. Will you pay for, for the journey? The director told me, “Yes, we pay for the journey and they have to bring the child here.”

00:44:17.866 --> 00:44:20.756
David Boder: Now, tell, how long has the child been here now?

00:44:20.756 --> 00:44:24.224
Eda Button: My child has been for fifteen days, my child here.

00:44:24.224 --> 00:44:27.863
David Boder: Yes. Has it, you say the child has not grown accustomed to you?

00:44:27.863 --> 00:44:34.392
Eda Button: The child has not gotten well accustomed because there they, there it had been very well, eh...

00:44:34.392 --> 00:44:34.736
David Boder: Kept?

00:44:34.736 --> 00:44:42.140
Eda Button: . . . kept, very good food, they surely loved her a lot. Maybe there they said that [I?] would not return.

00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:42.406
David Boder: Yes.

00:44:42.406 --> 00:44:45.249
Eda Button: They wanted to, eh...

00:44:45.249 --> 00:44:43.717
David Boder: Keep?

00:44:43.717 --> 00:44:44.685
Eda Button: . . . keep the child, eh

00:44:44.685 --> 00:44:50.058
David Boder: [interrupts] And how, you said, did the child pray, how did the child pray, when you back...

00:44:50.058 --> 00:44:59.148
Eda Button: [interrupts] My, my child was praying that dear little Jesus from her mother and her father, eh...

00:44:59.148 --> 00:45:00.663
David Boder: Greet?

00:45:00.663 --> 00:45:01.725
Eda Button: No, eh, [unintelligible].

00:45:01.725 --> 00:45:02.631
David Boder: Receive?

00:45:02.631 --> 00:45:11.221
Eda Button: Receive. His mother should very fast return, his mother should become a Catholic.

00:45:11.221 --> 00:45:16.703
David Boder: Yes. And now the child says that sometimes, sometimes it says that it wants to return to the Sisters?

00:45:16.703 --> 00:45:23.591
Eda Button: The child, for I have been deported and I have nothing that the Sisters there very much, eh...

00:45:23.591 --> 00:45:24.543
David Boder: Have given?

00:45:24.543 --> 00:45:34.649
Eda Button: . . . eh, food has and especially for my child. I have brought her here in [unintelligible]. They have, the doctor has, the doctors have...

00:45:34.649 --> 00:45:35.805
David Boder: Examined her?

00:45:35.805 --> 00:45:59.910
Eda Button: . . . examined her, and I had to have her operated on for throat and nose. And for this the child—that from the moment that she came to me she suffered—she believes that I made her bad [sick]. And especially if she, the little one, maybe she was told that her mother was bad...

00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:00.316
David Boder: Oh well.

00:46:00.316 --> 00:46:06.846
Eda Button: I don’t know what she was told. And now slowly, slowly I must give her, eh, with, eh...

00:46:06.846 --> 00:46:09.861
David Boder: A lot of attention?

00:46:09.861 --> 00:46:14.985
Eda Button: . . . with attention and slowly she will, the child will belong to me. But...

00:46:14.985 --> 00:46:15.953
David Boder: [unintelligible] Yes?

00:46:15.953 --> 00:46:24.088
Eda Button: The child loves very much for the Sisters. And means very much. [She perhaps means “they mean a lot to her”?] And this week I took her to the Jewish, eh...

00:46:24.088 --> 00:46:34.028
David Boder: Synagogue?

00:46:34.028 --> 00:46:40.797
Eda Button: . . . Sisters. And means very much. And this week I took her to the Jewish, eh...

00:46:40.797 --> 00:46:41.448
David Boder: Synagogue?

00:46:41.448 --> 00:46:48.837
Eda Button: . . . to the synagogue and I said to her, “You shall pray here, a child [prays?] in the synagogue to the Father[?].”

00:46:48.837 --> 00:46:57.945
David Boder: Yes. Now, everything will be just fine, Mrs. Button. I thank you very much. This is a very important story that you have told us.

00:46:57.945 --> 00:47:36.800
David Boder: [In English] This concludes Spool 26. There are additional twen—, hm, twelve minutes of wire on it that will have to be rewound. It’s Illinois Institute of Technology recording, wire recording of a Greek Jewish Woman, Eda Button, of 34 years old, who now has, eh, whom now her child was returned that was kept in a convent in Saloniki. And she plans to reunite herself with her husband in Tel Aviv whom she will have to remarry because for needs of, for expediency she divorced him in Greece.

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:37.665
David Boder: [In German] Thank you very much, Mrs. Button.
