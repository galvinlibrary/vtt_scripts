David Boder: [In English] This is spool 9-141B. Mrs. Sophia, she at the beginning refused to give her name and wanted to go under only under the name Sophia.

Sophia Zurilis: At a school for girls.

00:02:00.873 --> 00:02:16.073

David Boder: Well, proceed slowly; you don’t need to [unintelligible].

00:02:19.079 --> 00:03:15.510
Sophia Zurilis: Yes. [unintelligible] June 17th the Bolsheviks came into the country. At first they appeared very inoffensive and promised us not to bring about any changes to our political system. Only the government had to be changed, and then only a different administration needed to come, and all else remains unchanged. But after a short period, maybe one, two weeks, after all we recognized they were lying. There were changes instantly. People were, eh, instantly “adopted” and the, our “Eiszwerge”, which are an organization of the, eh, of the, eh, Farmers and, eh, those of the farmers, they, eh, were, they were armed and all, and they were also instantly disestablished. All were disarmed.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.119
David Boder: Why did the farmers get armed? Were the farmers armed?

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:24.280

David Boder: Yes?

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:28.172
Sophia Zurilis: A, a civilian organization, probably...

00:03:28.172 --> 00:03:28.324
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:28.324 --> 00:03:29.446

David Boder: Yes?

00:03:37.212 --> 00:03:43.312
Sophia Zurilis: And, after that, he was. . .

00:03:43.312 --> 00:03:44.070
David Boder: Transported?

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.589
Sophia Zurilis: . . . yes, transported to Moscow, as a, eh, eh, a arrested person.

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.953
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:47.953 --> 00:03:48.196
Sophia Zurilis: Yes.

00:03:48.196 --> 00:03:48.806
David Boder: Well?

00:03:48.806 --> 00:04:19.900
Sophia Zurilis: Well, and then, eh, and then immediately it was noticeable in school. We had to adopt the communist doctrine and to [unintelligible] all of the communist, eh, views to the children. And also, we have to, which [unintelligible], we could no longer, eh, eh, teach, eh, religion and we should, we should merely, whenever possible, direct against something.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.034
David Boder: Yes. Who forced you to do that?

00:04:22.034 --> 00:04:25.702
Sophia Zurilis: Well, that were the instructions from the, eh, administration.

00:04:25.702 --> 00:04:28.203
David Boder: Were there any Latvian communists in the. . .?

00:04:28.203 --> 00:04:37.341
Sophia Zurilis: Yes, yes, there were Latvian communists. Latvian communists and, eh, mostly all came from Moscow, the, eh, instructions were from Moscow.

00:04:37.341 --> 00:04:37.792
David Boder: Yes?

00:04:37.792 --> 00:05:22.258
Sophia Zurilis: And all Latvian communists had to subject to that. That’s how it was like. Only then, eh, after, eh, yes, we had to change the syllabus completely, there were differe..., different school books immediately, in school we had to show them all and, eh [unintelligible] and we had to hang up all the, the big portraits and, eh, all in red. And we were not allowed, eh, the subject Latvian, the word Latvia and our anthem, we were not allowed to sing that. And generally we were not allowed to speak of our flags, the flag was taken down and we were not allowed, eh, to talk of such things, not even in school, neither amongst the others.

00:05:22.258 --> 00:05:27.158
David Boder: And then?

00:05:27.158 --> 00:05:44.266
Sophia Zurilis: After that the [unintelligible] heard a lot, people were to be arrested and [unintelligible].

00:05:44.266 --> 00:05:45.108
David Boder: And well, what is with you?

00:05:45.108 --> 00:07:03.967
Sophia Zurilis: Well, me, me, yes, yes. Eh, well, I have to say nothing had yet happened to me personally. For me it was very calm at school and, eh, lonely, I also didn’t socialize with others and I now know that at the time of the Bolsheviks we were not permitted to speak anything special, because there were spies everywhere. And if you say anything against the Bolsheviks, you are instantly arrested at the [unintelligible] and then disappear without a trace. Many of my friends had disappeared like that, uh, and, eh, eh, after, the relatives went inquiring, but received no answer. Afterwards you only learned that they were sent to Moscow and from Moscow on and on towards Siberia. Well, and, eh, you constantly lived under pressure from the outside. There was always, eh, a terrible fear. At night you heard, eh, the bell ring at the, eh, door, you got scared and thought you went to [unintelligible name of place] and get arrested. Well, my husband, he was a, eh, artist, uh, he didn’t have anything to do politically, eh, with the Bolsheviks and such, so it was that nothing happened to us.

00:07:03.967 --> 00:07:05.296
David Boder: Was your husband a painter?

00:07:05.296 --> 00:07:06.925
Sophia Zurilis: Yes, artist.

00:07:06.925 --> 00:07:07.767
David Boder: Yes, well?

00:07:07.767 --> 00:07:34.502
Sophia Zurilis: Well, and, eh, and so June 17th then, eh, we learnt that many people got arrested, and we don’t know for which reasons, that wasn’t told to us, and many got arrested and deported, to Siberia. Well, and I went to, eh, the beach with the children right after the holid..., the holidays came, and, eh, then...

00:07:34.502 --> 00:07:36.156
David Boder: I understand. How many children did you have?

00:07:36.156 --> 00:07:37.665
Sophia Zurilis: I had three children.

00:07:37.665 --> 00:07:40.070
David Boder: And, eh, where did you go with your...

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:45.577
Sophia Zurilis: To the beach, to my villa, I had a villa...

00:07:45.577 --> 00:07:46.148
David Boder: Well?

00:07:46.148 --> 00:07:59.465
Sophia Zurilis: Well, then, eh, then, eh, then I heard, eh, that, that soon the Germans come and the Russians are already pulling out from Riga. And on the 21st, the Germans arrived...

00:07:59.465 --> 00:08:00.283
David Boder: Which 21st?

00:08:00.283 --> 00:08:37.930
Sophia Zurilis: . . . July 21st came, eh, June 21st, excuse me, June 21st y—..., you hear of the Germans arriving. And on July 1st they came in along the beach and we were really glad to be freed from the Russians. Well, and, eh, for a, for some time we were very, eh, glad, but after two months we understood that the Germans want to suppress us just as the Russians did. Well and then, but in school we did not yet notice any special hint...

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:39.824
David Boder: Yes, again all, which...

00:08:39.824 --> 00:08:40.155
Sophia Zurilis: Yes, yes.

00:08:40.155 --> 00:08:42.536
David Boder: . . . the, the wounded were let go...

00:08:42.536 --> 00:09:57.132
Sophia Zurilis: [unintelligible] we got different books, we knew by heart what we had during the time of Ulman, but they were completely printed anew. But they were not as, as, as biased as with the communists. [Longer passage unintelligible] we realized on every turn that we were regarded by the Germans as a, a, a, eh, as second rate humans. And [some words unintelligible] were a day off, we also couldn’t [unintelligible]. And then, eh, afterwards, it was written down in the testimonies that the, eh, the Latvians, that they are a, eh, people, which, eh, will not remain here in Latvia, except maybe, eh, relocated somewhere to Russia [unintelligible]. So, we did not get anything exceptional from the Germans either. But the massive [unintelligible] fear, we did not have that. Because, eh, the arrest was [unintelligible], that was not as big as that of the Bolsheviks.

00:09:57.132 --> 00:09:58.274
David Boder: There were fewer...

00:09:58.274 --> 00:09:59.116
Sophia Zurilis: Yes, yes.

00:09:59.116 --> 00:10:02.162
David Boder: Well, and how did the Germans behave towards the Jews?

00:10:02.162 --> 00:10:10.669
Sophia Zurilis: Yes, well, with the Jews, that was some kind of [unintelligible]. The Jews were immediately in, eh, in, in, in, how is that called...?

00:10:10.669 --> 00:10:11.240
David Boder: In ghettos?

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:39.563
Sophia Zurilis: Yes, the Jews were immediately dr..., eh, driven to the ghetto, and then we heard, later we heard they were led out of the ghetto,and shot. Indeed, little was written in the newspapers, it was all [unintelligible], but the Russians had promised it [rest of the sentence unintelligible]. Just like the Russians, eh, [unintelligible] shot the Latvians and others, the Germans did the...

00:10:39.563 --> 00:10:43.802
David Boder: Yes, and what did the Germans do to the remaining Russians, who stayed there?

00:10:43.802 --> 00:10:47.776
Sophia Zurilis: Well, the Russian, eh, the Russian, the communists?

00:10:47.776 --> 00:10:49.946
David Boder: Yes, or did they kill the Russian soldiers?

00:10:49.946 --> 00:10:55.958
Sophia Zurilis: Well. No, eh, soldiers, I don’t know that. But the communists, they were arrested. Yes.

00:10:55.958 --> 00:11:00.588
David Boder: Well, and what did you do, and what happened after that?

00:11:00.588 --> 00:11:11.055
Sophia Zurilis: Well, and then, then the front steadily closed in and then the, the Germans told us one would have to leave the country, Riga.

00:11:11.055 --> 00:11:12.113
David Boder: Who had to leave Riga?

00:11:12.113 --> 00:11:28.165
Sophia Zurilis: The, the population had to leave Riga. Who doesn’t want to leave Riga goes without food stamps [unintelligible] and without the [unintelligible] material and, eh, the others, eh, comes to you and you must leave.

00:11:28.165 --> 00:11:29.247
David Boder: Yes?

00:11:29.247 --> 00:11:35.199
Sophia Zurilis: And then the people were already [unintelligible] with, eh, with, eh, with [unintelligible]...

00:11:35.199 --> 00:11:36.066
David Boder: [unintelligible]

00:11:36.066 --> 00:12:06.079
Sophia Zurilis: I see. Well, me [unintelligible] I did not have to leave, I could stay. And I did not hesitate, and I did not hesitate, because the enemy, he came closer and Riga was already threatened [unintelligible] and also from, from the air, eh, the bombs came and, eh, and so we had to leave after all [some words unintelligible]. And especially for my [unintelligible] the bombs were very [unintelligible].

00:12:06.079 --> 00:12:07.342
David Boder: Where did you live...?

00:12:07.342 --> 00:12:10.264

00:12:10.264 --> 00:12:10.871
David Boder: [unintelligible]

00:12:10.871 --> 00:12:24.975

00:12:24.975 --> 00:12:45.749
Sophia Zurilis: . . . and [unintelligible] on toward the port, and from the port straight away into the train, and in Dachau out of the train.

00:12:45.749 --> 00:12:46.386

Sophia Zurilis: No, that was a German vessel...

00:12:59.139 --> 00:13:06.835
