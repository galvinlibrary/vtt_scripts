00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: How old are you?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.782
Jacob Minski: I am thirty-nine years old.

00:00:00.782 --> 00:00:29.573
David Boder: [In English] This is Spool 70...[Test of microphone] This is Spool 70, taken in Paris on August 23, 1946, at the headquarters of the Joint Distribution Committee. The interviewee is Mr. Jacob Minski, thirty-nine, who will speak in German. [In German] Now them, Mr. Minski, will you give us your full name again? Tell us where you were born and where the war found you.

00:00:29.573 --> 00:00:30.416
Jacob Minski: My name?

00:00:30.416 --> 00:00:30.997
David Boder: Louder please...

00:00:30.997 --> 00:00:34.075
Jacob Minski: Yes. My name is Jacob Minski...

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:34.376
David Boder: Yes...

00:00:34.376 --> 00:00:40.003
Jacob Minski: . . . born the...the twenty-fifth of November, 1907, in Zurich.

00:00:40.003 --> 00:00:42.892
David Boder: Oh! Are you a Swiss subject, Mr. Minski?

00:00:42.892 --> 00:01:01.707
Jacob Minski: No-o...I am Stateless. My parents are from Poland, but they have left Poland since an early age; and...I hardly cleared my citizenship. You see, I was brought up in the orphanage in Hamburg.

00:01:01.707 --> 00:01:03.212
David Boder: Yes...

00:01:03.212 --> 00:01:10.172
Jacob Minski: And so I was there during my whole sojourn in Germany. I lived for about twenty-five years in Hamburg, without interruption.

00:01:10.172 --> 00:01:10.813
David Boder: Yes...

00:01:10.813 --> 00:01:18.712
Jacob Minski: I had...I lived on a Stateless passport. And due to that I also had immigration difficulties. Otherwise, I would have emigrated a long time ago.

00:01:18.712 --> 00:01:23.596
David Boder: Yes...Now tell me this. Are your parents living?

00:01:23.596 --> 00:01:27.426
Jacob Minski: My parents are not living anymore. I shall tell you briefly...

00:01:27.426 --> 00:01:28.209
David Boder: Yes, please.

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:47.987
Jacob Minski: . . . When we...in October, 1941, I received from the Gestapo by way of a registered letter the invitation [order] to appear on a certain day at Mohrweiden street with twenty-five pounds of baggage.

00:01:47.987 --> 00:01:48.830
David Boder: Where...on what...?

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.915
Jacob Minski: In Hamburg, Mohrweiden Street.

00:01:50.915 --> 00:01:53.232
David Boder: Yes. That was in forty-one?

00:01:53.232 --> 00:01:54.797
Jacob Minski: That was ’41, Yes.

00:01:54.797 --> 00:01:56.973
David Boder: And the war started for Germany?

00:01:56.973 --> 00:01:58.306
Jacob Minski: . . . ’39...on...

00:01:58.306 --> 00:02:01.414
David Boder: ’39. So for two years they left you alone?

00:02:01.414 --> 00:02:10.592
Jacob Minski: For two years we could relatively...That is, we wore the Jew-star—were ‘tagged;’ we had to buy in designated stores...

00:02:10.592 --> 00:02:11.263
David Boder: Yes...

00:02:11.263 --> 00:02:15.867
Jacob Minski: And it is self-understood that we had no right to go to theaters and other [public] places...

00:02:15.867 --> 00:02:21.744
David Boder: Don’t make that so ‘self-understood;’ we in America don’t know that. You were not permitted to go to theaters, to movies...?

00:02:21.744 --> 00:02:46.255
Jacob Minski: No theaters, no movies,...We were, of course, through the Jew star so ‘branded’...That is, one had no right to cover up the Jew star by means of a brief case so that...because that was a severely punishable act. One was...it was [considered] an act of camouflage—it came under the law of camouflage and camouflage was subject to penalty.

00:02:46.255 --> 00:02:47.399
David Boder: [He uses for camouflage a rather uncommon word ‘Tarnung’ which is the reason for the question] And what is ‘Tarnung?’

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:52.373
Jacob Minski: Tarnung, that means to walk under a false banner, so to speak [to act under false identity]

00:02:52.373 --> 00:02:52.833
David Boder: Yes...

00:02:52.833 --> 00:02:55.030
Jacob Minski: That means one covered the Jew [star]...

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.814
David Boder: What kind of a word is ‘Tarnung?’

00:02:56.814 --> 00:03:08.309
Jacob Minski: Tarnung? I would almost say that here in German...It is a kind of defense, a cover up, when one...one...

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:09.492
David Boder: Camouflage?

00:03:09.492 --> 00:03:11.276
Jacob Minski: Yes. Camo...Something like it. One may also say camouflage.

00:03:11.276 --> 00:03:16.031
David Boder: Yes, Yes. Sit more comfortably. Now then...

00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:18.477
Jacob Minski: [Words not clear]

00:03:18.477 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: You may now see, when the indicator light flashes...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Jacob Minski: Yes...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:03:21.908
David Boder: . . . then it means that you are talking loud enough.

00:03:21.908 --> 00:03:23.649
Jacob Minski: Aha...Aha...

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:25.959
David Boder: That it flashes just a bit.

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:26.780
Jacob Minski: Aha...

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.864
David Boder: Yes...

00:03:27.864 --> 00:03:32.176
Jacob Minski: And we journeyed from Hamburg...We journeyed...

00:03:32.176 --> 00:03:34.051
David Boder: Now then...You were assembled there...

00:03:34.051 --> 00:03:43.358
Jacob Minski: We were there...we were there assembled in a large building and that was the first transport for Lodz in Sile...[word not finished] for Lodz...[searches for words]

00:03:43.358 --> 00:03:44.661
David Boder: . . . was compelled to go [to Lodz] ?

00:03:44.661 --> 00:03:44.820
Jacob Minski: . . . was compelled to go.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.860
David Boder: Why to Lodz? Were you considered a Pole?

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:54.338
Jacob Minski: That means...One cannot say that there were exclusively Poles. There were all nationalities. There were also German...

00:03:54.338 --> 00:03:55.211
David Boder: Jews?

00:03:55.211 --> 00:03:55.813
Jacob Minski: German Jews.

00:03:55.813 --> 00:03:57.296
David Boder: Yes. Now then...

00:03:57.296 --> 00:04:11.379
Jacob Minski: This was the only transport that went to Lodz. There were about twelve hundred Jews under the ‘leadership’ at that time...the ‘transport leader’ was at that time Dacke from the Department of Emigration.

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:14.728
David Boder: Yes...What kind of RR-cars were you given?

00:04:14.728 --> 00:04:23.093
Jacob Minski: Those were...in that case [??] there were relatively decent RR-cars. As an exception, these were not cattle cars.

00:04:23.093 --> 00:04:26.984
David Boder: They were third [class] such wooden...?

00:04:26.984 --> 00:04:27.866
Jacob Minski: Wooden cars.

00:04:27.866 --> 00:04:39.370
Jacob Minski: Wooden cars. So he said that time to those assembled at the rr-station...He said ironically, ‘You will now travel without [?] tickets.’

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.282
David Boder: Yes...

00:04:40.282 --> 00:04:47.212
Jacob Minski: And so then...When we...In two days we arrived in Lodz.

00:04:47.212 --> 00:04:48.816
David Boder: The train must have gone fast?

00:04:48.816 --> 00:04:52.406
Jacob Minski: No...It was comparatively slow. One cant’ say [that it went fast] .

00:04:52.406 --> 00:04:55.033
David Boder: Were you fed on the way?

00:04:55.033 --> 00:05:11.291
Jacob Minski: We got something from the Jewish community...We were fed, that is, we were given [word not clear] provisions. Possibly...I don’t know whether the Jewish community was informed that we...that we were going to Lodz. At any rate, we were given sufficient food...

00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:11.932
David Boder: Yes...

00:05:11.932 --> 00:05:25.752
Jacob Minski: . . . and when we arrived in Lodz we were assembled in a school...That is in Lodz...in a school...It was in a frightful condition...

00:05:25.752 --> 00:05:26.896
David Boder: [Few words not clear]

00:05:26.896 --> 00:05:31.780
Jacob Minski: We, of course, were unable to imagine what that meant to live in a Lodz Ghetto.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:32.993
David Boder: Oh...You were taken to the Ghetto?

00:05:32.993 --> 00:05:35.078
Jacob Minski: . . . to the Ghetto—Yes, to the Ghetto.

00:05:35.078 --> 00:05:35.530
David Boder: Now...

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:48.658
Jacob Minski: . . . to the Lodz Ghetto...There we had [to live] under the most frightful conditions, one would say from a hygienic standpoint—under conditions worse than in a concentration camp.

00:05:48.658 --> 00:05:53.383
David Boder: Now then. Continue please.

00:05:53.383 --> 00:05:54.806
Jacob Minski: I...I...

00:05:54.806 --> 00:05:59.982
David Boder: Wait a moment. [Apparently adjustment of recorder] Now then...

00:05:59.982 --> 00:06:43.225
Jacob Minski: From this...form this single transport, which went to the Lodz Ghetto, as far as it is known at the most three [persons] have survived. Most of them either starved to death in the Ghetto—part had died of typhus, or were immediately ‘resettled.’ What does that mean ‘resettled?’ The people who were idle, who did not...did not accept [find] a job. Most lived under the belief that the war would soon be over. Why then should they accept a job, and that was their misfortune. I don’t know what moved me to accept a job; that is...I was...

00:06:43.225 --> 00:06:45.340
David Boder: Did one have a choice, to accept?

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:58.700
Jacob Minski: One could...Yes...Everyone could get a job in his own trade because the Lodz Ghetto, as the Germans...as the Germans themselves claimed, [was] a model Ghetto.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.543
David Boder: Oh!

00:06:59.543 --> 00:07:05.480
Jacob Minski: Under the leadership of the Jewish elder, Chaim Rumkowski.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.031
David Boder: Rumkowski?

00:07:06.031 --> 00:07:09.621
Jacob Minski: Yes...who was, I would almost say, an exploiter...

00:07:09.621 --> 00:07:10.111
David Boder: Yes...

00:07:10.111 --> 00:07:16.009
Jacob Minski: . . . in favor of the Germans. If the Germans...[demanded] a hundred percent, he would deliver a hundred and fifty percent. And so he...

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:16.310
David Boder: What do you mean, a hundred percent?

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.349
Jacob Minski: A hundred percent production—labor production.

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:20.071
David Boder: Yes...

00:07:20.071 --> 00:07:23.502
Jacob Minski: He...Of course, what I [?] got [?] for it...

00:07:23.502 --> 00:07:26.941
David Boder: Have you any idea of what has become of Rumkowski? Where is he now?

00:07:26.941 --> 00:07:33.441
Jacob Minski: Rumkowski was ‘burned’ with his whole family as soon as they arrived in Auschwitz.

00:07:33.441 --> 00:07:34.262
David Boder: Rumkowski was ‘burned?’

00:07:34.262 --> 00:07:34.955
Jacob Minski: Yes...Yes.

00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:38.785
David Boder: So much was reported about Rumkowski in Lodz...

00:07:38.785 --> 00:07:50.581
Jacob Minski: Rumkowski was actually like a king; he behaved...if according to his theory...according to his point of view every person belonged...belonged to him...

00:07:50.581 --> 00:07:50.710
David Boder: Yes...

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:54.050
Jacob Minski: . . . Everything that one possessed, that one had, belonged to him.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.090
David Boder: Now who has elevated him to this height?

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:57.731
Jacob Minski: The Germans.

00:07:57.731 --> 00:07:58.914
David Boder: The Germans.

00:07:58.914 --> 00:08:07.228
Jacob Minski: At any rate, they were very satisfied with him; that as a reward [with a chuckle] he had to go to the crematory, is a separate issue...

00:08:07.228 --> 00:08:09.012
David Boder: That was the German gratitude...

00:08:09.012 --> 00:08:10.186
Jacob Minski: That was the German gratitude.

00:08:10.186 --> 00:08:21.990
David Boder: But wait, since you have come to the topic of Rumkowski I have already heard from others [about it] Have you heard anything about the speech he delivered when he requested the mothers to surrender their children?

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:44.996
Jacob Minski: Yes...He...he...of course, when the Germans demanded a thousand or two thousand people for work from him, so he, of course, could not explain it to them in the manner in which the Germans informed him about it. Because in such case nobody would have presented himself voluntarily. He was compelled of course...He attempted in a round about way...

00:08:44.996 --> 00:08:45.878
David Boder: . . . to convince?

00:08:45.878 --> 00:08:54.403
Jacob Minski: . . . to convince the people—that they would present themselves voluntarily for work; under the pretext that they would go to Germany to work and would be fed much better...

00:08:54.403 --> 00:08:55.074
David Boder: Yes...

00:08:55.074 --> 00:09:06.057
Jacob Minski: . . . and there were, of course, many, since most people suffered greatly from starvation. So he knew how to persuade them to present themselves voluntarily.

00:09:06.057 --> 00:09:06.367
David Boder: Yes...

00:09:06.367 --> 00:09:11.762
Jacob Minski: And this ‘voluntary’ presentation was...meant practically death.

00:09:11.762 --> 00:09:12.244
David Boder: Yes...

00:09:12.244 --> 00:09:13.427
Jacob Minski: . . . death.

00:09:13.427 --> 00:09:14.640
David Boder: Now...

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:21.058
Jacob Minski: We...I presented myself as a fireman—for the fire brigade...And I based that on the contention...[He searches for words; apparently not on account of a general language difficulty, but either due to emotional stress or the ‘high scientific plane’ on which he attempts to base his explanation]

00:09:21.058 --> 00:09:23.977
David Boder: Yes...That...?

00:09:23.977 --> 00:09:47.315
Jacob Minski: . . . that the body, in...Let us say...in the process of great work output...Well...[a pause] or much...Let’s say better...with the scarce nourishment which we got.

00:09:47.315 --> 00:09:47.947
David Boder: Yes...

00:09:47.947 --> 00:09:50.024
Jacob Minski: . . . They really did not want [they could not] to do much.

00:09:50.024 --> 00:09:50.876
David Boder: . . . wanted to do...

00:09:50.876 --> 00:09:52.570
Jacob Minski: . . . They did not want to do...

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:53.292
David Boder: They had to save strength...?

00:09:53.292 --> 00:10:05.268
Jacob Minski: Yes...You should not forget that we had to work twelve hours in the factory on a water soup and two hundred and fifty grams of bread.

00:10:05.268 --> 00:10:08.036
David Boder: What kind of factory was that?

00:10:08.036 --> 00:10:20.372
Jacob Minski: . . . There were, of course, all kinds of factories. Every...I mean...[Word not clear] factories...There were all kinds...all kinds.

00:10:20.372 --> 00:10:21.615
David Boder: . . . of work opportunities?

00:10:21.615 --> 00:10:26.860
Jacob Minski: . . . work opportunities. Indeed, everyone, according to his abilities...He worked, let us say, in a shoe factory, or...

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.367
David Boder: And where did the shoes go to?

00:10:29.367 --> 00:10:32.295
Jacob Minski: The shoes were, of course, delivered to the Germans...

00:10:32.295 --> 00:10:32.876
David Boder: Ah...

00:10:32.876 --> 00:10:33.818
Jacob Minski: . . . according to orders.

00:10:33.818 --> 00:10:33.917
David Boder: Yes...

00:10:33.917 --> 00:10:36.054
Jacob Minski: There were orders [for merchandise] given...

00:10:36.054 --> 00:10:36.966
David Boder: Aha...

00:10:36.966 --> 00:10:43.745
Jacob Minski: . . . for fixed dates [of delivery] ; and delivery was made accordingly.

00:10:43.745 --> 00:10:46.514
David Boder: Was there any pay for the work?

00:10:46.514 --> 00:10:49.201
Jacob Minski: What do you mean? For it they delivered provisions.

00:10:49.201 --> 00:10:50.254
David Boder: Yes...

00:10:50.254 --> 00:10:54.527
Jacob Minski: They delivered the merchandise—the raw materials in the Ghetto.

00:10:54.527 --> 00:10:54.978
David Boder: Yes...

00:10:54.978 --> 00:10:59.582
Jacob Minski: . . . and for the work they [delivered]...

00:10:59.582 --> 00:11:00.064
David Boder: . . . provisions?

00:11:00.064 --> 00:11:01.668
Jacob Minski: . . . delivered provisions.

00:11:01.668 --> 00:11:06.341
David Boder: Yes...But if one did not work he also got his food?

00:11:06.341 --> 00:11:20.122
Jacob Minski: Well...At the beginning...at the beginning it was not so bad. Later on the people who...who did [singular] not work...who did [plural] not work...were...they withdrew [from them] a certain ration...

00:11:20.122 --> 00:11:20.784
David Boder: Yes...

00:11:20.784 --> 00:11:24.425
Jacob Minski: . . . That is when the period of deportations had begun.

00:11:24.425 --> 00:11:25.794
David Boder: Yes...

00:11:25.794 --> 00:11:35.784
Jacob Minski: I joined, as I said, the fire brigade; and in consequence I had only outdoor service. That is, I only had to watch that there were no fires.

00:11:35.784 --> 00:11:37.582
David Boder: Yes...

00:11:37.582 --> 00:11:54.261
Jacob Minski: My colleagues who arrived together with me, all of them, more or less, as said before, died of starvation or were deported. Because the people who could not work were a useless [word not clear] element...

00:11:54.261 --> 00:11:55.043
David Boder: Yes...

00:11:55.043 --> 00:12:12.919
Jacob Minski: And they were shortly, after a brief stay...sent immediately to Auschwitz, or some other concentration camp. [Pause] Later, that was about in 1944.

00:12:12.919 --> 00:12:14.394
David Boder: Were you in Lodz that long?

00:12:14.394 --> 00:12:25.687
Jacob Minski: Yes, I was...I was in Lodz that long...In 1944, about in July...in July, ’44, it reached also the fire brigade. We were, of course, the last...And so...

00:12:25.687 --> 00:12:27.170
David Boder: What does that mean, you were the last?

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:38.966
Jacob Minski: Everybody...everybody was deported according to orders...That is, the Ghetto was to be cleaned out; and you were told, the then chief official Dieburg...

00:12:38.966 --> 00:12:39.637
David Boder: Yes...

00:12:39.637 --> 00:12:49.898
Jacob Minski: . . . would tell you that we were going to Germany, to work, and that there were opportunities to be better fed, and...

00:12:49.898 --> 00:12:53.067
David Boder: . . . and the lager supervisor...What was his name?

00:12:53.067 --> 00:12:54.069
Jacob Minski: Rumkowski?

00:12:54.069 --> 00:12:54.520
David Boder: What?

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.664
Jacob Minski: Not Rumkowski, you mean...?

00:12:55.664 --> 00:12:57.509
David Boder: Yes,...was Rumkowski already away?

00:12:57.509 --> 00:13:00.046
Jacob Minski: Rumkowski was there still up to the last moment.

00:13:00.046 --> 00:13:00.988
David Boder: Yes. Well...

00:13:00.988 --> 00:13:05.962
Jacob Minski: You see, Rumkowski departed one transport before us.

00:13:05.962 --> 00:13:07.114
David Boder: Yes...

00:13:07.114 --> 00:13:21.618
Jacob Minski: I had really a chance to remain in the Ghetto, because the director in chief, Dieburg, has said that a number of single young men will remain to clean up the Ghetto.

00:13:21.618 --> 00:13:23.664
David Boder: Yes...

00:13:23.664 --> 00:14:09.239
Jacob Minski: I don’t know what made me [to decide] to abandon the Ghetto...I don’t know...Possibly I was convinced by the speech of Dieburg, which he directed especially to the fire brigade. I could have as well remained in the Ghetto.with my friend with whom I lived together, and who was a fireman; but I decided there and then to join the transport which presumably was to go to Germany to work. We were loaded into cattle cars—into lead sealed cattle cars; that is, eighty [persons] in each. On the average eighty per car [?]...

00:14:09.239 --> 00:14:10.091
David Boder: Men and women together?

00:14:10.091 --> 00:14:41.478
Jacob Minski: Men, women, and children...I must say that at that moment I almost regretted that I had taken that decision. Because even if I did not know exactly that I was going to a concentration camp, I still had a peculiar presentiment that if we were traveling to work under the [favorable] conditions which were presented to us, then it appeared to me strange that we were sealed in cattle cars, without the possibility to even step out [to the toilet]

00:14:41.478 --> 00:14:41.779
David Boder: Yes...

00:14:41.779 --> 00:14:48.158
Jacob Minski: And no light...Fortunately one of us had a drill on him...

00:14:48.158 --> 00:14:48.579
David Boder: Yes...

00:14:48.579 --> 00:14:51.137
Jacob Minski: . . . that he drilled a small hole in the floor...

00:14:51.137 --> 00:14:51.619
David Boder: . . . in the floor?

00:14:51.619 --> 00:15:07.817
Jacob Minski: . . . in the floor, so that we could throw [?] ‘it’ out. And so we were two days en route without...without the slightest possibility to move. You cannot imagine in what conditions we...

00:15:07.817 --> 00:15:08.247
David Boder: . . . arrived...?

00:15:08.247 --> 00:15:09.962
Jacob Minski: . . . arrived in Auschwitz.

00:15:09.962 --> 00:15:20.735
David Boder: Now wait a moment. I want to have more details, more particulars about this trip. Now then, how many people do you estimate were with you in the RR-car?

00:15:20.735 --> 00:15:22.549
Jacob Minski: We were eighty people?

00:15:22.549 --> 00:15:23.873
David Boder: How do you know the number?

00:15:23.873 --> 00:15:41.627
Jacob Minski: Well, we knew that about eighty [per] car were...We saw that they were driven in by the SS or by...by the SS with clubs; and to the extent to which a RR-car could at all hold a person—that many were crowded in...I mean, in some RR-cars there could have been a few less than eighty, some had more...

00:15:41.627 --> 00:15:42.900
David Boder: Yes...

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:50.973
Jacob Minski: But we can accept an average...

00:15:50.973 --> 00:15:51.304
David Boder: Yes...

00:15:51.304 --> 00:15:53.019
Jacob Minski: . . . of eighty people.

00:15:53.019 --> 00:15:54.524
David Boder: Well...And there were men, women...

00:15:54.524 --> 00:15:58.538
Jacob Minski: Men, women, and children, you see, with their baggage, of course...

00:15:58.538 --> 00:15:59.745
David Boder: They were permitted to take baggage?

00:15:59.745 --> 00:16:01.863
Jacob Minski: Yes. They were permitted to take their baggage. This was not prohibited.

00:16:01.863 --> 00:16:02.344
David Boder: Yes...

00:16:02.344 --> 00:16:04.180
Jacob Minski: As much, of course, as one could carry.

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:04.609
David Boder: Yes...

00:16:04.609 --> 00:16:09.782
Jacob Minski: Of course, the people thought that if they are going to Germany to work, so they should take working clothes...

00:16:09.782 --> 00:16:09.932
David Boder: Yes...

00:16:09.932 --> 00:16:13.761
Jacob Minski: Everyone took his kit and caboodle—all his possessions he took with him.

00:16:13.761 --> 00:16:16.801
David Boder: And then you were sealed in the RR-cars? Were there any windows?

00:16:16.801 --> 00:16:20.442
Jacob Minski: There were no windows. There were some small cracks here and there...

00:16:20.442 --> 00:16:20.833
David Boder: Yes...

00:16:20.833 --> 00:16:22.087
Jacob Minski: . . . in the...in the RR-cars...

00:16:22.087 --> 00:16:27.564
David Boder: Now...How...how did you take care of your needs...?

00:16:27.564 --> 00:16:35.141
Jacob Minski: Indeed! I told you already...Fortunately, that person has broken a hole in the floor, otherwise we could not have taken care of our extreme needs...

00:16:35.141 --> 00:16:38.100
David Boder: How big was that hole?

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.944
Jacob Minski: That hole was...It had a diameter of about ten centimeters.

00:16:40.944 --> 00:16:43.992
David Boder: One could throw out also the feces?

00:16:43.992 --> 00:16:44.955
Jacob Minski: Possibly [a few words not clear]

00:16:44.955 --> 00:16:46.851
David Boder: And what did the women do?

00:16:46.851 --> 00:16:55.225
Jacob Minski: Of course, you can imagine that with the excitement [nervousness] that prevailed that everyone had the need to relieve [?] himself...

00:16:55.225 --> 00:16:57.512
David Boder: Yes...and...

00:16:57.512 --> 00:17:07.240
Jacob Minski: That of course, led to utmost indecency [??] We arrived...under the most frightful conditions...we arrived in Auschwitz...

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:14.281
David Boder: Could you describe the conduct of individual passengers, certain passengers for me? Let us say, were there...

00:17:14.281 --> 00:17:20.360
Jacob Minski: At the beginning...at the beginning we were, so to speak, not in such a bad mood. We expected [?] that possibly...

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:21.783
David Boder: Were you sitting or standing?

00:17:21.783 --> 00:17:29.366
Jacob Minski: We were partly sitting, partly standing. It was so crowded that we simply could not move, you see?

00:17:29.366 --> 00:17:29.607
David Boder: Yes...

00:17:29.607 --> 00:17:32.023
Jacob Minski: We were unable...to move in any direction.

00:17:32.023 --> 00:17:33.257
David Boder: Yes...

00:17:33.257 --> 00:17:47.228
Jacob Minski: The mood was at the beginning, as said before...We endeavored...the mood...Well...How should I say it...?

00:17:47.228 --> 00:17:49.795
David Boder: . . . to keep up your courage?

00:17:49.795 --> 00:17:51.910
Jacob Minski: Yes, possibly to keep up the courage. Well...

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:53.475
David Boder: Yes...Did you talk...?

00:17:53.475 --> 00:18:02.984
Jacob Minski: Afterwards...Yes, we were conversing; in part we were in good spirits—some even attempted to tell some jokes...in order just to disguise the situation.

00:18:02.984 --> 00:18:04.167
David Boder: . . . to overcome?

00:18:04.167 --> 00:18:18.138
Jacob Minski: Only as the trip began to appear endless, certain individuals began to become suspicious...

00:18:18.138 --> 00:18:21.607
David Boder: Did you get any provisions in the RR-car?

00:18:21.607 --> 00:18:22.811
Jacob Minski: Only that what we have taken with us.

00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:24.075
David Boder: . . . what you had with you. Did they provide water?

00:18:24.075 --> 00:18:31.486
Jacob Minski: No. No. Just until we were sealed up, water was provided.

00:18:31.486 --> 00:18:32.870
David Boder: What did you have?

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:40.333
Jacob Minski: Only something...[He becomes very erratic] whatever was passed around...People attempted...and whoever stretched out a beaker or something of the kind...

00:18:40.333 --> 00:18:41.034
David Boder: They would fill it up?

00:18:41.034 --> 00:18:46.751
Jacob Minski: He would get...to be sure, not always...not always did the SS agree to it.

00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:50.783
David Boder: Yes...Were the SS in Lodz?

00:18:50.783 --> 00:18:51.355
Jacob Minski: Yes.

00:18:51.355 --> 00:18:54.033
David Boder: . . . or were these Poles or Ukrainians?

00:18:54.033 --> 00:18:59.088
Jacob Minski: I cannot say for sure. They were...most of them were Germans...

00:18:59.088 --> 00:18:59.600
David Boder: Yes...

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.099
Jacob Minski: Or...or, what were they called—Folk-Germans?

00:19:03.099 --> 00:19:06.780
David Boder: Yes, Folk-Germans...

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:19.607
Jacob Minski: Yes, Folk-Germans...Also the arrival in Auschwitz was also somewhat remarkable. At any rate, when the RR-car was opened we saw the prisoners for the first time.

00:19:19.607 --> 00:19:20.570
David Boder: Yes...

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:33.723
Jacob Minski: Prisoners, in striped suits. One of them turned to me and asked me to give him my wristwatch, with the remark that anyway, I was now going to Petrus [Saint Peter]

00:19:33.723 --> 00:19:34.686
David Boder: What does that mean...to Pet. [rus] ?

00:19:34.686 --> 00:19:36.040
Jacob Minski: To Petrus, that meant to the Merciful God.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:36.582
David Boder: Yes...

00:19:36.582 --> 00:19:36.892
Jacob Minski: I could not...

00:19:36.892 --> 00:19:37.954
David Boder: Was that a Jewish prisoner?

00:19:37.954 --> 00:19:40.662
Jacob Minski: I could not judge exactly...At such a moment...

00:19:40.662 --> 00:19:40.783
David Boder: Yes...

00:19:40.783 --> 00:19:42.206
Jacob Minski: . . . being nervous, one is unable...

00:19:42.206 --> 00:19:43.560
David Boder: Yes...

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:46.870
Jacob Minski: What that was to mean I found out later.

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:51.414
David Boder: Was it not known in Lodz what was going on in these lagers?

00:19:51.414 --> 00:19:54.673
Jacob Minski: We are...We were actually cut off from the outside world.

00:19:54.673 --> 00:19:55.133
David Boder: Yes...

00:19:55.133 --> 00:19:57.631
Jacob Minski: That is why we knew much too little...We were not...

00:19:57.631 --> 00:20:00.348
David Boder: Well...He asked you for your watch...What did you say?

00:20:00.348 --> 00:20:05.855
Jacob Minski: Well, to that—nothing. I would not dream of giving him the watch. [Only in a dream could it occur to me to give him the watch] You see?

00:20:05.855 --> 00:20:06.707
David Boder: Is this the same watch?

00:20:06.707 --> 00:20:09.605
Jacob Minski: No, that is not the same. This one I got already here.

00:20:09.605 --> 00:20:10.426
David Boder: Well...

00:20:10.426 --> 00:20:16.625
Jacob Minski: When we...Afterwards...Yes, we were to get out of the RR-cars; and to leave all the baggage there.

00:20:16.625 --> 00:20:17.618
David Boder: Yes...

00:20:17.618 --> 00:20:54.952
Jacob Minski: And in addition, we had to get in formation five in a row; and one in uniform...a uniformed [person] who revealed himself later as the physician of the lager, indicated by gestures right and left, where each one had to go. That the going to the left, looking from where I stood, meant to go into the lager, while those people who were to stand to the right were going immediately into over...into the crematories—that we could not...that, thanks to God, we did not know.

00:20:54.952 --> 00:20:55.313
David Boder: But did you...

00:20:55.313 --> 00:20:57.149
Jacob Minski: At any rate, a Jew noticed...

00:20:57.149 --> 00:20:57.609
David Boder: Yes...

00:20:57.609 --> 00:21:03.989
Jacob Minski: Now a Jew noticed how a prisoner who at...a so-called ‘Canadian’—they were called Canadians—...

00:21:03.989 --> 00:21:04.299
David Boder: Yes...

00:21:04.299 --> 00:21:07.197
Jacob Minski: . . . one who worked at the railroad. I don’t know why...

00:21:07.197 --> 00:21:08.771
David Boder: . . . Why were they called Canadians?

00:21:08.771 --> 00:21:26.714
Jacob Minski: Yes...They were called ‘Canadians.’ There is no explnation for this name. At any rate, I [?] noticed how a...how a prisoner who worked at the railroad, was tearing away the child...the child from a young woman...from a young woman in order to force it on an older woman.

00:21:26.714 --> 00:21:27.024
David Boder: Yes...

00:21:27.024 --> 00:21:38.106
Jacob Minski: This had the following meaning: an old person, an older person was...was to go under any circumstances, to the crematory...

00:21:38.106 --> 00:21:38.738
David Boder: Yes...

00:21:38.738 --> 00:21:46.050
Jacob Minski: . . . while the young, a young person, alone, not accompanied by children had a chance...

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:46.110
David Boder: Aha...

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:47.916
Jacob Minski: . . . to go into the lager.

00:21:47.916 --> 00:21:49.399
David Boder: . . . And so he has taken the child away from her.

00:21:49.399 --> 00:21:54.244
Jacob Minski: Of course. Of course, he could do that only at a moment when, by chance, the lager physician would not notice it.

00:21:54.244 --> 00:21:55.788
David Boder: Did she know that...?

00:21:55.788 --> 00:22:02.658
Jacob Minski: She, of course, did not surmise what that could signify. He took her child from her arms and transferred it [attached, forced it upon] to an older woman...

00:22:02.658 --> 00:22:03.088
David Boder: Yes...

00:22:03.088 --> 00:22:04.924
Jacob Minski: Since she later, anyway...

00:22:04.924 --> 00:22:05.655
David Boder: Anyhow...

00:22:05.655 --> 00:22:08.514
Jacob Minski: . . . was to be burned...would be burned anyhow.

00:22:08.514 --> 00:22:10.569
David Boder: Nu...

00:22:10.569 --> 00:22:12.645
Jacob Minski: That was explained to us much [?] later.

00:22:12.645 --> 00:22:13.187
David Boder: Yes...

00:22:13.187 --> 00:22:23.297
Jacob Minski: The march into the lager was neither, a specially cheerful one; that is...

00:22:23.297 --> 00:22:26.908
David Boder: . . . Tell us the details. We have to have the particulars. Well...?

00:22:26.908 --> 00:22:37.452
Jacob Minski: We marched into the lager; that is, the whole fire brigade, except the ones who departed before us.

00:22:37.452 --> 00:22:38.815
David Boder: Which fire brigade...

00:22:38.815 --> 00:22:40.982
Jacob Minski: The Lodz Fire Brigade. I, of course, belonged to the Lodz Fire Brigade...

00:22:40.982 --> 00:22:41.141
David Boder: Yes...

00:22:41.141 --> 00:22:42.225
Jacob Minski: The Jewish Lodz Fire Brigade.

00:22:42.225 --> 00:22:43.107
David Boder: Yes...

00:22:43.107 --> 00:22:50.819
Jacob Minski: When I heard from the...about the transports in which the Jewish Police, too, were present—You see, we also had a Jewish Police...

00:22:50.819 --> 00:22:51.902
David Boder: Yes...

00:22:51.902 --> 00:22:54.189
Jacob Minski: . . . that a large part of them were burned...

00:22:54.189 --> 00:22:55.784
David Boder: Why?

00:22:55.784 --> 00:23:00.538
Jacob Minski: They allegedly did not behave decently towards the population...

00:23:00.538 --> 00:23:01.110
David Boder: . . . towards the Jewish population?

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:02.133
Jacob Minski: . . . the Jewish population.

00:23:02.133 --> 00:23:02.464
David Boder: Well...

00:23:02.464 --> 00:23:24.168
Jacob Minski: . . . Of course. And since the police had a very bad name among the population, and [since] many prisoners were already in the concentration camp who previously too, were in the Lodz Ghetto; that is, those who arrived before us. So they came to an understanding with the supervisors about this...

00:23:24.168 --> 00:23:24.349
David Boder: . . . police?

00:23:24.349 --> 00:23:30.316
Jacob Minski: . . . this fact, and for them [prisoners—supervisors of the crematories] it, of course, made no difference who they were burning—true?

00:23:30.316 --> 00:23:30.806
David Boder: Yes...

00:23:30.806 --> 00:23:31.258
Jacob Minski: And so...

00:23:31.258 --> 00:23:33.524
David Boder: What kind of supervisors? Were the supervisors Jewish prisoners?

00:23:33.524 --> 00:23:42.440
Jacob Minski: There were not only...No, there was among them, let us say...as a consequence of their own situation [?]...

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.670
David Boder: . . . a certain solidarity with other prisoners?

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:50.426
Jacob Minski: . . . There were some who occupied a privileged position—such as capo...

00:23:50.426 --> 00:23:50.938
David Boder: Yes...

00:23:50.938 --> 00:23:51.007
Jacob Minski: . . . and the like.

00:23:51.007 --> 00:23:58.440
David Boder: Let me see whether I understand you correctly. The prisoners who had something against the Jewish policemen—the Jewish...

00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:58.720
Jacob Minski: Yes...

00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:59.361
David Boder: . . . prisoners,...

00:23:59.361 --> 00:23:59.851
Jacob Minski: Yes...

00:23:59.851 --> 00:24:01.145
David Boder: . . . had them...

00:24:01.145 --> 00:24:02.048
Jacob Minski: . . . later, as these [policemen] arrived...

00:24:02.048 --> 00:24:04.245
David Boder: . . . later, as these arrived...made arrangements...

00:24:04.245 --> 00:24:08.326
Jacob Minski: . . . took notice of them [??] or made such arrangements [arranged it] that these were immediately shoved into the oven.

00:24:08.326 --> 00:24:11.585
David Boder: . . . were shoved...Well...

00:24:11.585 --> 00:24:29.949
Jacob Minski: We were then assembled in a square, and we were ordered to throw on the ground anything that we had in our pockets; that means watches, gold, etc.,—that is, everything that we still had because we had to abandon the baggage anyway...

00:24:29.949 --> 00:24:30.370
David Boder: Now, who...

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:36.388
Jacob Minski: Say, somebody had a watch—a wristwatch, a ring...

00:24:36.388 --> 00:24:36.735
David Boder: Yes...

00:24:36.735 --> 00:24:42.160
Jacob Minski: . . . or anything else that presented any kind of value; so he was compelled to put in on the ground...

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.424
David Boder: Even a wedding band [ring] ?

00:24:43.424 --> 00:24:47.246
Jacob Minski: Just the same. Any object. He could not keep anything.

00:24:47.246 --> 00:24:48.429
David Boder: Hm...

00:24:48.429 --> 00:24:56.231
Jacob Minski: We were...After this took place we had to undress, the clothes...

00:24:56.231 --> 00:24:56.923
David Boder: . . . on the street...?

00:24:56.923 --> 00:25:02.490
Jacob Minski: . . . on a...No, that was in an open square, in an open square; that is, it was closely fenced in...

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:03.664
David Boder: Yes. But outdoors, under the clear sky?

00:25:03.664 --> 00:25:05.569
Jacob Minski: Yes...[under] the clear sky, the...

00:25:05.569 --> 00:25:05.939
David Boder: Yes...

00:25:05.939 --> 00:25:09.038
Jacob Minski: . . . clear sky...Then we were...

00:25:09.038 --> 00:25:10.573
David Boder: What month was it?

00:25:10.573 --> 00:25:12.409
Jacob Minski: That was in the month of July.

00:25:12.409 --> 00:25:14.103
David Boder: Yes...Well...

00:25:14.103 --> 00:25:21.957
Jacob Minski: Then we were taken into a hall. Various prisoners sat there with razor blades, who shaved our whole bodies—shaved us completely...

00:25:21.957 --> 00:25:22.508
David Boder: Jewish prisoners? [?]

00:25:22.508 --> 00:25:25.947
Jacob Minski: In part Jewish—part non-Jewish [??]

00:25:25.947 --> 00:25:27.241
David Boder: Did they use soap?

00:25:27.241 --> 00:25:32.056
Jacob Minski: No. And [painful?] shaving—with dry razor blades, dry, dry...

00:25:32.056 --> 00:25:33.630
David Boder: Razor knifes?

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:35.775
Jacob Minski: Razor apparatus...No...

00:25:35.775 --> 00:25:37.190
David Boder: Oh, electrical?

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:40.118
Jacob Minski: No, No, No, No...Plain shaving apparatus.

00:25:40.118 --> 00:25:43.979
David Boder: The so-called safety razors?

00:25:43.979 --> 00:25:47.178
Jacob Minski: Yes, Yes. And, of course, dry—without soap...

00:25:47.178 --> 00:25:47.608
David Boder: Yes...

00:25:47.608 --> 00:25:53.235
Jacob Minski: And the people were expressedly shaven on the whole body...

00:25:53.235 --> 00:25:53.957
David Boder: Yes...

00:25:53.957 --> 00:25:58.080
Jacob Minski: . . . Wherever there was a single [little] hair at all on the body...

00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:58.721
David Boder: Yes...

00:25:58.721 --> 00:26:03.063
Jacob Minski: You can imagine how painful that is, when one is being shaved a tempo [in a hurry] and then being smattered with various tinctures [chuckle]

00:26:03.063 --> 00:26:04.628
David Boder: Why?

00:26:04.628 --> 00:26:06.804
Jacob Minski: I don’t know. Possibly for disinfection.

00:26:06.804 --> 00:26:07.445
David Boder: . . . disinfection.

00:26:07.445 --> 00:26:14.826
Jacob Minski: . . . smarting, then one had to run through under a shower. At any rate, all kind of experiments [antics]

00:26:14.826 --> 00:26:15.488
David Boder: How?

00:26:15.488 --> 00:26:30.714
Jacob Minski: I mean the whole procedure...I mean, was so awkward. The worst part was only the shaving, which was so unpleasant. Then they threw us some prisoners’ clothing, size estimated on sight. The shoes...

00:26:30.714 --> 00:26:32.288
David Boder: Were you tattooed?

00:26:32.288 --> 00:26:36.540
Jacob Minski: No. That...That I shall explain to you later.

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:38.054
David Boder: Yes. Now...

00:26:38.054 --> 00:26:39.026
Jacob Minski: We...

00:26:39.026 --> 00:26:39.667
David Boder: The shoes...

00:26:39.667 --> 00:26:44.701
Jacob Minski: The shoes...the shoes we could keep on bare feet [?] That means, later one got rid [was deprived?] of them, too...

00:26:44.701 --> 00:26:45.303
David Boder: Yes...

00:26:45.303 --> 00:26:58.522
Jacob Minski: . . . in a peculiar manner. We...After we camped the whole night outdoors in this manner—it was rather cold that time...

00:26:58.522 --> 00:26:59.343
David Boder: Yes...

00:26:59.343 --> 00:27:07.077
Jacob Minski: . . . We were led into the lager proper. We were then assigned to various blocks...to various blocks...

00:27:07.077 --> 00:27:08.260
David Boder: Yes...

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:16.785
Jacob Minski: They were kind of like horse stables—just like such a horse stable...

00:27:16.785 --> 00:27:18.178
David Boder: Were these old buildings?

00:27:18.178 --> 00:27:20.676
Jacob Minski: These were such barracks, barracks...

00:27:20.676 --> 00:27:22.641
David Boder: Specially build barracks?

00:27:22.641 --> 00:27:26.772
Jacob Minski: No. We were taken into the Gypsy lager.

00:27:26.772 --> 00:27:27.133
David Boder: Yes...

00:27:27.133 --> 00:27:33.663
Jacob Minski: We were led into the Gypsy lager; that is, before us it was occupied by the Gypsies who were all burned [Footnote 1: See story of Anna Kovitzka-Kaletzka] .

00:27:33.663 --> 00:27:36.401
David Boder: Do you know anything more about the Gypsies?

00:27:36.401 --> 00:27:37.936
Jacob Minski: No. I cannot...

00:27:37.936 --> 00:27:40.443
David Boder: What was told about them?

00:27:40.443 --> 00:28:07.617
Jacob Minski: At any rate, I know only that the Gypsies were completely—the major part of them were burned. We were led into that so-called Gypsy lager. And so we were assigned to the various blocks, crowed up to a thousand people in a hall where normally about thee hundred people possibly could find room.

00:28:07.617 --> 00:28:12.883
David Boder: Have you an idea by whom and when these blocks were built? You are talking about Auschwitz now?

00:28:12.883 --> 00:28:14.508
Jacob Minski: Yes. I am talking about Birkenau.

00:28:14.508 --> 00:28:23.204
David Boder: Birkenau and Auschwitz are one and the same? [Footnote 2: They were different camps but closely located and under the same management.] where were the crematories? In Birkenau or Auschwitz?

00:28:23.204 --> 00:28:27.641
Jacob Minski: [Hesitantly] I cannot [tell you that] either. I have really never thought about it. One actually had no chance to think.

00:28:27.641 --> 00:28:28.003
David Boder: Yes...

00:28:28.003 --> 00:28:30.396
Jacob Minski: We were really like a herd of wethers [rams]

00:28:30.396 --> 00:28:32.872
David Boder: Yes. But you have seen the crematories—you have seen the chimneys...

00:28:32.872 --> 00:28:36.814
Jacob Minski: One saw them smoking. Personally [from nearby] I have not seen them. One has to...

00:28:36.814 --> 00:28:38.198
David Boder: Have you seen them smoke?

00:28:38.198 --> 00:28:40.395
Jacob Minski: Smoke—of course! And particularly...

00:28:40.395 --> 00:28:42.962
David Boder: How did that smoke look?

00:28:42.962 --> 00:28:44.476
Jacob Minski: Well...dark smoke.

00:28:44.476 --> 00:28:45.057
David Boder: yes...

00:28:45.057 --> 00:28:56.169
Jacob Minski: Dark. The...As already said, these blocks...they were thoroughly damp [?? The word he uses ‘hineingefercht’ or ‘hineingeferzt’ seems to have a colloquial meaning]

00:28:56.169 --> 00:28:59.600
David Boder: Who built these blocks? When were they built? When were they built?

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.354
Jacob Minski: This I cannot...tell you either.

00:29:01.354 --> 00:29:05.296
David Boder: Were they built before or were they built especially?

00:29:05.296 --> 00:29:07.974
Jacob Minski: I cannot tell you that either, for sure.

00:29:07.974 --> 00:29:08.696
David Boder: Well...

00:29:08.696 --> 00:29:16.911
Jacob Minski: Neither do I know that. At any rate, the block elder who gave the instructions—that was a Pole, not a Jew.

00:29:16.911 --> 00:29:18.394
David Boder: What did he say?

00:29:18.394 --> 00:29:20.651
Jacob Minski: He said that he knows...

00:29:20.651 --> 00:29:21.403
David Boder: He was a prisoner?

00:29:21.403 --> 00:29:38.495
Jacob Minski: A prisoner, yes. He knows especially about the Jews of Lodz, that they had gold and diamonds in their possession, and that they, in order to hide them, were capable under certain circumstances to swallow them...

00:29:38.495 --> 00:29:39.046
David Boder: Yes...

00:29:39.046 --> 00:29:48.202
Jacob Minski: They should surrender them voluntarily; otherwise they would do all kinds of things to us and we would feel sorry later.

00:29:48.202 --> 00:29:49.406
David Boder: He said that right out openly?

00:29:49.406 --> 00:29:50.519
Jacob Minski: Openly before us. Yes, in our block.

00:29:50.519 --> 00:29:52.656
David Boder: Was there no Gestapo man present.

00:29:52.656 --> 00:29:55.343
Jacob Minski: No, no. He told it to us in the block.

00:29:55.343 --> 00:29:56.336
David Boder: Yes...

00:29:56.336 --> 00:30:08.673
Jacob Minski: Subsequently, afterwards, in order to give us an idea, so to speak, of what it means to be in a lager, he picked out one and beat him up in such a violent manner that he fell nearly unconscious [the German stereotype, ‘that he lost hearing and sight’]

00:30:08.673 --> 00:30:10.122
David Boder: A newcomer?

00:30:10.122 --> 00:30:11.227
Jacob Minski: One of us.

00:30:11.227 --> 00:30:11.547
David Boder: Yes...

00:30:11.547 --> 00:30:12.440
Jacob Minski: . . . of us.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.432
David Boder: And he, himself, was a capo [a trustee]

00:30:14.432 --> 00:30:16.636
Jacob Minski: He was...he was a block elder.

00:30:16.636 --> 00:30:18.103
David Boder: Yes. But he was a prisoner.

00:30:18.103 --> 00:30:18.966
Jacob Minski: A prisoner...He was...

00:30:18.966 --> 00:30:21.864
David Boder: What...What did he beat him up with?

00:30:21.864 --> 00:30:24.176
Jacob Minski: With a bar..., a thick club...

00:30:24.176 --> 00:30:25.069
David Boder: With a stick?

00:30:25.069 --> 00:30:27.544
Jacob Minski: With a stick. Frightfully...

00:30:27.544 --> 00:30:28.721
David Boder: And where did he hit him?

00:30:28.721 --> 00:30:42.725
Jacob Minski: Over the face, on the back, and all over...So that he could not move anymore. That made, of course, a terrible impression on us...And afterwards he said that everyone should lay down whatever he possesses—what he still possesses...

00:30:42.725 --> 00:30:45.411
David Boder: Now, you said he beat up the man, and then he said...

00:30:45.411 --> 00:30:49.302
Jacob Minski: He beat him up frightfully and...he...

00:30:49.302 --> 00:30:50.117
David Boder: For what reason?

00:30:50.117 --> 00:31:02.461
Jacob Minski: For no reason whatsoever, only to make a certain impression on us, that if anyone of us...of us...still had something in his possession, that he now...

00:31:02.461 --> 00:31:02.974
David Boder: . . . give it up?

00:31:02.974 --> 00:31:12.149
Jacob Minski: . . . give it up. That means—in order that it proceed unobserved [safely??] we were driven to the other side and the people could then leave in that place whatever they possessed.

00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:14.270
David Boder: Yes...That was already inside?

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:15.707
Jacob Minski: . . . already in the block...in the block.

00:31:15.707 --> 00:31:16.238
David Boder: Yes...

00:31:16.238 --> 00:31:23.180
Jacob Minski: After he had ‘established’ that what the people had left, there was too little...

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:23.621
David Boder: . . . was...

00:31:23.621 --> 00:31:45.369
Jacob Minski: He gave us...He delivered a speech to us again, and said that we would be led out in the square right away and that there shall occur a much stronger recheck. Thus, an exhortation again...that in case we got something...

00:31:45.369 --> 00:31:45.913
David Boder: . . . to surrender...

00:31:45.913 --> 00:31:47.108
Jacob Minski: . . . to surrender it.

00:31:47.108 --> 00:31:51.152
David Boder: Now how could people surrender it if they had swallowed it?

00:31:51.152 --> 00:31:55.287
Jacob Minski: That is [was?] of course, a ridiculous remark. He simply wanted to instill fear in us.

00:31:55.287 --> 00:31:58.366
David Boder: Were there people who had swallowed some gold?

00:31:58.366 --> 00:32:04.601
Jacob Minski: No. That is, of course, a ridiculous notion of that man. He wanted to bluff us into it [Footnote 3: Other interviewees definitely claim that such was the case, and that prisoners were threatened with X-ray examinations. See story of Kaldore.] .

00:32:04.601 --> 00:32:05.809
David Boder: Well, I heard differently.

00:32:05.809 --> 00:32:07.246
Jacob Minski: Did you hear something about it?

00:32:07.246 --> 00:32:07.807
David Boder: Yes.

00:32:07.807 --> 00:32:10.131
Jacob Minski: Well...I knew nothing about it. At any rate...

00:32:10.131 --> 00:32:10.433
David Boder: Nu...

00:32:10.433 --> 00:32:20.514
Jacob Minski: . . . were then called to the appell square, and I...I had then still comparatively decent shoes...

00:32:20.514 --> 00:32:20.864
David Boder: Yes...

00:32:20.864 --> 00:32:26.327
Jacob Minski: . . . on me...And I observed how somebody was sort of circling around me, eyeing my shoes.

00:32:26.327 --> 00:32:27.492
David Boder: Who was that, a prisoner?

00:32:27.492 --> 00:32:28.748
Jacob Minski: Also a prisoner.

00:32:28.748 --> 00:32:29.883
David Boder: Yes...

00:32:29.883 --> 00:32:44.056
Jacob Minski: Well...He ordered me to take off my shoes so he could try them on. They did not fit him well, but he liked them all too much to part with them. And he threw me a pair of old tatters in return.

00:32:44.056 --> 00:32:45.263
David Boder: Yes...

00:32:45.263 --> 00:32:54.518
Jacob Minski: At any rate, I was told not to do anything about it, since there is a frightful punishment for it, I [?] would be punished.

00:32:54.518 --> 00:32:54.778
David Boder: Who?

00:32:54.778 --> 00:33:02.921
Jacob Minski: [He dismisses the subject with a mumble] Sleeping was the worst...in such a block.

00:33:02.921 --> 00:33:05.366
David Boder: Yes...

00:33:05.366 --> 00:33:07.014
Jacob Minski: The conditions of nourishment...

00:33:07.014 --> 00:33:13.793
David Boder: Now will you please tell me...Please describe how did you sleep in such a block?

00:33:13.793 --> 00:33:22.865
Jacob Minski: I have told you already that in such a block three hundred people could lay down normally.

00:33:22.865 --> 00:33:23.680
David Boder: Where? On the floor?

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:36.809
Jacob Minski: On the floor. Naturally, on the floor. Since it was made of lime [stone] squares, the floor was covered with boards. Every night these boards were laid out; in the morning they were collected.

00:33:36.809 --> 00:33:37.111
David Boder: Yes...

00:33:37.111 --> 00:33:39.091
Jacob Minski: And every evening they were laid out again.

00:33:39.091 --> 00:33:40.618
David Boder: The floor was of stone?

00:33:40.618 --> 00:33:58.908
Jacob Minski: The floor was of stone. Now the floor would be laid out with boards, and one stretched out; that is, one could not stretch out—that was impossible; and it was perfunctorily measured out [estimated] how many people...let us say...

00:33:58.908 --> 00:34:00.978
David Boder: Were there no plankbeds, no beds...?

00:34:00.978 --> 00:34:03.906
Jacob Minski: No...Such things did not exist. Such things did not exist by us.

00:34:03.906 --> 00:34:04.830
David Boder: Not a...

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:06.991
Jacob Minski: . . . There was only the floor.

00:34:06.991 --> 00:34:07.281
David Boder: Yes...

00:34:07.281 --> 00:34:10.317
Jacob Minski: . . . and specifically, we had [to take on] a hop position.

00:34:10.317 --> 00:34:11.555
David Boder: What is a hop position?

00:34:11.555 --> 00:34:16.764
Jacob Minski: A hop position means one sits down on the floor and the legs have to be...

00:34:16.764 --> 00:34:17.458
David Boder: . . . pulled in?

00:34:17.458 --> 00:34:21.110
Jacob Minski: . . . pulled in to the chest...to the chest pulled in.

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:22.016
David Boder: Yes...

00:34:22.016 --> 00:34:28.040
Jacob Minski: So that about five people were sitting on each side.

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:31.149
David Boder: Not back to back?

00:34:31.149 --> 00:34:32.706
Jacob Minski: It meant, one with the back against the wall.

00:34:32.706 --> 00:34:32.918
David Boder: Yes...

00:34:32.918 --> 00:34:35.954
Jacob Minski: And the other five ahead of him.

00:34:35.954 --> 00:34:37.584
David Boder: Yes. Well...

00:34:37.584 --> 00:34:39.413
Jacob Minski: And so you can imagine in this...

00:34:39.413 --> 00:34:40.246
David Boder: And so people slept?

00:34:40.246 --> 00:34:46.813
Jacob Minski: . . . in this hop position one had to spend the whole night. That meant until four o’clock in the morning...

00:34:46.813 --> 00:34:49.650
David Boder: Yes. From what time in the evening?

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:55.083
Jacob Minski: From...We entered the block in the evening at seven o’clock.

00:34:55.083 --> 00:34:56.773
David Boder: Yes...

00:34:56.773 --> 00:35:04.198
Jacob Minski: Then the ration was haded out. The ration depended on the kindness of the particular block elder.

00:35:04.198 --> 00:35:06.148
David Boder: Well then...What was the ration at its best?

00:35:06.148 --> 00:35:20.170
Jacob Minski: The ration consisted of a piece of bread, a spoonful...a spoonful of meat; that is, canned meat...

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:21.106
David Boder: [Not clear]

00:35:21.106 --> 00:35:21.426
Jacob Minski: . . . and a bit...

00:35:21.426 --> 00:35:22.380
David Boder: [Not clear]

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:35.919
Jacob Minski: Yes. We marched, how does one say that?—in line, into the block; and in passing by they gave us, one with a spoon...

00:35:35.919 --> 00:35:37.025
David Boder: [Not clear]

00:35:37.025 --> 00:35:50.146
Jacob Minski: The piece of bread, a spoon of meat; eventually a spoon of honey that would be dispensed as a supplement to the ration. Since the block elders liked to drink liquor...

00:35:50.146 --> 00:35:51.190
David Boder: Yes...

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:55.204
Jacob Minski: . . . and a certain black ‘trading’ existed in the lager...

00:35:55.204 --> 00:35:56.623
David Boder: . . . between whom?

00:35:56.623 --> 00:36:01.591
Jacob Minski: . . . between prisoners who worked outside of the lager...

00:36:01.591 --> 00:36:02.062
David Boder: Yes...

00:36:02.062 --> 00:36:08.841
Jacob Minski: There were also prisoners who outside the lager...who worked outside the lager. who consequently had some contact with the peasants...

00:36:08.841 --> 00:36:09.221
David Boder: Tes...

00:36:09.221 --> 00:36:11.726
Jacob Minski: They then brought liquor into the lager,...

00:36:11.726 --> 00:36:11.877
David Boder: Yes...

00:36:11.877 --> 00:36:13.899
Jacob Minski: probably...of course, in a concealed manner.

00:36:13.899 --> 00:36:15.499
David Boder: Yes...

00:36:15.499 --> 00:36:19.712
Jacob Minski: And for this the block elders paid with breads.

00:36:19.712 --> 00:36:21.252
David Boder: Yes...

00:36:21.252 --> 00:36:29.449
Jacob Minski: A liter of liquor corresponded approximately to eighty breads—eighty kommiss breads [army breads or rations]

00:36:29.449 --> 00:36:36.602
David Boder: [He speaks loudly without interruption, covering with his voice the voice of the interviewer] How much [rest not clear] ? Yes. A kommis bread was enough for a person...Say for how long?

00:36:36.602 --> 00:36:42.548
Jacob Minski: Yes. Officially we received one kommis bread for four—eventually for five persons.

00:36:42.548 --> 00:36:43.170
David Boder: Yes...

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:50.130
Jacob Minski: [but] the block elder would distribute the rations so that ten or fifteen people [had to share one bread]

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:52.653
David Boder: Yes. And then he would keep the rest?

00:36:52.653 --> 00:36:56.577
Jacob Minski: And the rest he used to obtain liquor for himself.

00:36:56.577 --> 00:36:56.837
David Boder: Yes...

00:36:56.837 --> 00:37:05.366
Jacob Minski: [A chance for] a complaint, of course, did not exist; because if you would dare to complain that your portion was...

00:37:05.366 --> 00:37:06.121
David Boder: . . . was...

00:37:06.121 --> 00:37:11.179
Jacob Minski: . . . too small, he would beat you up frightfully—near the unconscious.

00:37:11.179 --> 00:37:11.994
David Boder: Well...

00:37:11.994 --> 00:37:44.245
Jacob Minski: And so [chuckle] one would accept what he got. We compared our portion among ourselves at times, going around from block to block [words not clear] inquiring, ‘How does your portion look?’ At any rate, the sleeping, as I already have said, was frightful. At times it was possible to stretch out, but then we were lying lengthwise just like herring. One was unable to move. Now imagine those many who had bladder trouble...

00:37:44.245 --> 00:37:44.686
David Boder: Yes...

00:37:44.686 --> 00:37:51.374
Jacob Minski: . . . who had to get out at night, had either to walk over the head or the feet of the other.

00:37:51.374 --> 00:37:51.525
David Boder: Yes...

00:37:51.525 --> 00:37:54.483
Jacob Minski: And in addition...

00:37:54.483 --> 00:37:57.429
David Boder: Now...now...How was that...? You were sitting down [see above] you were...

00:37:57.429 --> 00:38:02.004
Jacob Minski: No, eventually one could also lie down. That was by mutual agreement...

00:38:02.004 --> 00:38:02.397
David Boder: Yes...

00:38:02.397 --> 00:38:15.785
Jacob Minski: You see? But that was a lying like herring, without a chance to move at all. One could not move at all. That was, of course, unbearable. At times, one had to turn around...

00:38:15.785 --> 00:38:15.997
David Boder: Hm...

00:38:15.997 --> 00:38:49.082
Jacob Minski: . . . or stretch, at times, his legs or pull them in. Now if one had to step out, he had to step over the leg of another, or inadvertently step on his head. There was not enough light to see well, and so some individuals would begin to yell. The block elder who slept nearby, would start a ‘sport.’ ‘Sport’ was called, for instance, standing on the knees with stretched-out arms for about a half hour, [or] to sit in a squatting position [with stretched-out arms?]

00:38:49.082 --> 00:38:50.742
David Boder: [Not clear]

00:38:50.742 --> 00:38:54.455
Jacob Minski: In such a squatting position. That was, of course, [done by] the block elder.

00:38:54.455 --> 00:38:56.767
David Boder: How did he sleep? Did he have a bed [?]

00:38:56.767 --> 00:39:00.890
Jacob Minski: Yes. He had a little room for himself, such a couch [He uses the English word] .

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:02.025
David Boder: Yes.

00:39:02.025 --> 00:39:03.220
Jacob Minski: . . . a divan...

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:04.186
David Boder: Well...

00:39:04.186 --> 00:39:13.077
Jacob Minski: . . . and food was to him nothing unusual, because they had contact with the kitchen most often, since they had deals among themselves...

00:39:13.077 --> 00:39:13.409
David Boder: Yes...

00:39:13.409 --> 00:39:18.510
Jacob Minski: . . . and they had [enough of] everything. A...a block elder was like a king...

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:19.132
David Boder: Yes...

00:39:19.132 --> 00:39:20.659
Jacob Minski: . . . because...

00:39:20.659 --> 00:39:28.838
David Boder: [some whispers, apparently about the position of the mocrophone] Yes...

00:39:28.838 --> 00:39:37.259
Jacob Minski: I was exceptionally lucky, that after a comparatively short time, I got out from Auschwitz again.

00:39:37.259 --> 00:39:39.794
David Boder: Well...

00:39:39.794 --> 00:39:47.237
Jacob Minski: When they were looking for skilled workers; you see, skilled workers were...

00:39:47.237 --> 00:40:09.408
David Boder: One moment...This ends Spool 70 of Mr. Minski; and we are continuing on Spool 71. August 23, 1946. An Illinois Institute of Technology recording. Paris.

00:40:09.408 --> 00:40:32.273
David Boder: Spool Number 71. Mr. Minski continues. August 23, 1946, Paris. At the headquarters of the American Joint Distribution Committee, of the Immigration Division of the American Joint Distribution Committee. A recording of the Illinois Institute of Technology. Well...

00:40:32.273 --> 00:40:34.356
Jacob Minski: [Talk in whispers; apparently a question where to start]

00:40:34.356 --> 00:40:44.394
David Boder: Yes. Now then, you were telling how the block elder would come in, and then proceeded to ‘do sport’ with the people. [Her is an example that due to the necessity to manipulate the equipment, the interviewer too, could lose track of the narrative]

00:40:44.394 --> 00:40:45.119
Jacob Minski: Yes.

00:40:45.119 --> 00:40:46.163
David Boder: Now then...

00:40:46.163 --> 00:40:54.173
Jacob Minski: This ‘sport making’, as said before, proceeded in the following fashion. We had to take on a crouching [squatting] position. [He uses here Hockstellung]

00:40:54.173 --> 00:40:54.415
David Boder: Yes...

00:40:54.415 --> 00:41:01.163
Jacob Minski: . . . with stretched-out arms. And in this squatting position we had to remain for half an hour.

00:41:01.163 --> 00:41:02.491
David Boder: Yes...

00:41:02.491 --> 00:41:04.622
Jacob Minski: That was, of course, unbearable.

00:41:04.622 --> 00:41:05.123
David Boder: Yes...

00:41:05.123 --> 00:41:17.105
Jacob Minski: And after...ten or fifteen minutes, somebody was sent to the block elder with a plea to suspend this punishment—we shall...

00:41:17.105 --> 00:41:17.666
David Boder: . . . be...

00:41:17.666 --> 00:41:18.179
Jacob Minski: . . . be quiet.

00:41:18.179 --> 00:41:20.232
David Boder: He did not even remain present?

00:41:20.232 --> 00:41:27.373
Jacob Minski: No. He ordered some of the prisoners to supervise, a specifically...

00:41:27.373 --> 00:41:30.711
David Boder: How was it to be known that the half an hour was over?

00:41:30.711 --> 00:41:41.365
Jacob Minski: Well, at times that took place also outdoors, under supervision; in which case he too, walked up and down. Well, that could not be avoided...

00:41:41.365 --> 00:41:45.759
David Boder: Well...but I asked how would they know at night that a half an hour has passed?

00:41:45.759 --> 00:41:48.536
Jacob Minski: [Chuckle] Well, at any rate, the time appeared to us frightfully long...

00:41:48.536 --> 00:41:50.015
David Boder: Yes...Well people did [word not clear]

00:41:50.015 --> 00:42:02.739
Jacob Minski: . . . frightfully long...We were, of course, were glad when he suspended the punishment and one could get out [chuckle] of that...

00:42:02.739 --> 00:42:03.041
David Boder: Yes...

00:42:03.041 --> 00:42:12.941
Jacob Minski: . . . terrible position. In the morning at about four ‘oclock, or half past four, we were driven out of the block. We were served a cold coffee...

00:42:12.941 --> 00:42:13.683
David Boder: Outside?

00:42:13.683 --> 00:42:26.329
Jacob Minski: . . . that was outdoors. It could rain, or pour out and no chance for shelter, because the hall, the stable had to be straightened up.

00:42:26.329 --> 00:42:29.981
David Boder: And what kind of utensils were used?

00:42:29.981 --> 00:42:31.007
Jacob Minski: For the food?

00:42:31.007 --> 00:42:31.883
David Boder: Yes.

00:42:31.883 --> 00:42:39.929
Jacob Minski: The dishes were tin plates; of course, there were never enough for all—so a part had always to wait...

00:42:39.929 --> 00:42:40.666
David Boder: . . . until the others...the others [were] through?

00:42:40.666 --> 00:42:41.951
Jacob Minski: . . . until the others were through.

00:42:41.951 --> 00:42:44.728
David Boder: Could you wash meanwhile?

00:42:44.728 --> 00:43:00.078
Jacob Minski: Water was fetched in buckets, and there was...of course, there was nothing else besides a tin plate. That is, everything was stuffed directly into the mouth in the most primitive way and manner. We had, for instance...

00:43:00.078 --> 00:43:01.919
David Boder: There were no knifes or forks?

00:43:01.919 --> 00:43:07.654
Jacob Minski: No. That was, of course...Of course, prohibited. We attempted at the beginning to make some little wooden sticks...

00:43:07.654 --> 00:43:09.091
David Boder: [In whispers] Remove your arm [from the microphone]

00:43:09.091 --> 00:43:18.345
Jacob Minski: We tried to manufacture wooden sticks, and to consume our food with these wooden sticks...

00:43:18.345 --> 00:43:19.480
David Boder: [Chuckle] In a Chinese manner?

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:21.400
Jacob Minski: [Laughter]...in a Chinese way, Yes.

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:21.901
David Boder: Yes...

00:43:21.901 --> 00:43:29.265
Jacob Minski: This naturally, was prohibited to us; and whenever such sticks were noticed they were taken away.

00:43:29.265 --> 00:43:29.658
David Boder: Yes...

00:43:29.658 --> 00:43:44.374
Jacob Minski: Well...No work was done in the Gypsy lager; that is, the major part were idle...

00:43:44.374 --> 00:43:45.008
David Boder: Yes...

00:43:45.008 --> 00:44:02.794
Jacob Minski: That also was intolerable. All day one had to ramble. Even a pin had a value, and for a cigarette one would give away his soup, which actually meant life...

00:44:02.794 --> 00:44:04.200
David Boder: Hm...

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:36.030
Jacob Minski: . . . and as I have told you before, I had the unusual luck that after a comparatively short time I again got out of Auschwitz. I had never believed that I would get out from this lager alive. Imagine! As far as I may judge, it was the greatest concentration camp in Europe—of fifty-six square kilometers in size. That is, as far as the eye could ever see, you see only barbed wire. So if you could succeed to overcome one barbed wire [fence]...

00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:36.501
David Boder: Yes...

00:44:36.501 --> 00:44:43.491
Jacob Minski: . . . which is hardly possible; so you would have innumerable barbed wire [fences] to overcome. You see, that was practically out of the question.

00:44:43.491 --> 00:44:44.958
David Boder: Yes...

00:44:44.958 --> 00:44:50.047
Jacob Minski: And so one day there was a search for skilled workers...

00:44:50.047 --> 00:44:50.669
David Boder: Yes...

00:44:50.669 --> 00:45:00.979
Jacob Minski: . . . and one from the Labor Division, also a senior prisoner, examined the people on their skills...

00:45:00.979 --> 00:45:01.963
David Boder: Yes...

00:45:01.963 --> 00:45:08.259
Jacob Minski: . . . He was especially strict, and was very nasty at the inquiry...

00:45:08.259 --> 00:45:09.062
David Boder: A Jewish...?

00:45:09.062 --> 00:45:12.219
Jacob Minski: No, that was not a Jewish prisoner. He...

00:45:12.219 --> 00:45:14.380
David Boder: What was he?

00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:19.891
Jacob Minski: He was, I think, a kind of Pole. At any rate, he spoke German very well...

00:45:19.891 --> 00:45:21.038
David Boder: Yes...

00:45:21.038 --> 00:45:27.666
Jacob Minski: . . . and he examined the people concerning...I must say, as to their general knowledge...

00:45:27.666 --> 00:45:28.318
David Boder: Yes...

00:45:28.318 --> 00:45:30.117
Jacob Minski: . . . this [man] form the Labor Division...

00:45:30.117 --> 00:45:30.437
David Boder: Yes...

00:45:30.437 --> 00:45:39.147
Jacob Minski: So, for instance if they looked for mechanics, then he asked certain questions. And when you were unable to answer instantly to these questions he would slap your face...

00:45:39.147 --> 00:45:40.928
David Boder: [Not clear]

00:45:40.928 --> 00:45:58.904
Jacob Minski: [Laughter] . because he was not a mechanic. Of course, the people who in their nervousness could not give immediately an answer, even if they were actually skilled workers, he would box their ears, and then they had no more right to apply.

00:45:58.904 --> 00:46:02.544
David Boder: Do you have an idea why this man was a prisoner?

00:46:02.544 --> 00:46:08.610
Jacob Minski: I don’t know what he had committed. At any rate, he carried an armband...

00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:08.761
David Boder: Yes...

00:46:08.761 --> 00:46:10.500
Jacob Minski: [Saying] Labor Division.

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:11.182
David Boder: Yes...

00:46:11.182 --> 00:46:16.645
Jacob Minski: And he was put in charge of assigning people to work outside of the lager.

00:46:16.645 --> 00:46:17.659
David Boder: Yes...

00:46:17.659 --> 00:46:29.297
Jacob Minski: And so one day when that business started with...with the transport; that is, a lot of people were sent away from the concentration camp Auschwitz...

00:46:29.297 --> 00:46:30.190
David Boder: Where to?

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:34.718
Jacob Minski: That’s what we did not know. But one could request to be registered...

00:46:34.718 --> 00:46:35.732
David Boder: . . . for work?

00:46:35.732 --> 00:46:51.687
Jacob Minski: . . . for work. Only nobody knew where they were going. I caused myself to be registered at three different places [occasions] There was some anxiety...The work transport had some kind of a tang. We believed that meant a trip to the oven [Footnote 4: Such registration could prove at times fatal for the prisoners. There was a definite policy of the Nazis in Eastern Europe, at least at the beginning of the war, to bleed the occupied countries and the ghettos of their intellectual manpower. In a perfideous fashion calls were made for academically trained people with the alleged purpose to put in order the city archives, libraries, etc. Prisoners were zealously competing for these assignments, and the interviews gave the appearance of strict selective examinations. But the ‘lucky’ winners of these contests were in many cases secretly assigned for direct extermination [Kovno Ghetto] ] .

00:46:51.687 --> 00:46:52.399
David Boder: Yes.

00:46:52.399 --> 00:47:07.731
Jacob Minski: It often happened that it was said a transport was to go away to work, and instead of work they went into the oven. We all were very suspicious. However, we registered at the various places [categories or occasions?]

00:47:07.731 --> 00:47:08.335
David Boder: Hm...

00:47:08.335 --> 00:47:30.838
Jacob Minski: I myself, did not know for what reason. I...My friend who came with me from Hamburg, prevailed upon me to register with a group of three hundred skilled workers. That I should...they were looking for three hundred skilled workers...and for this group I also registered.

00:47:30.838 --> 00:47:32.075
David Boder: What was your trade?

00:47:32.075 --> 00:47:37.623
Jacob Minski: I had no trade whatsoever. I just told them that I was some kind of a specialist [laughter]...

00:47:37.623 --> 00:47:38.498
David Boder: Yes...

00:47:38.498 --> 00:47:45.349
Jacob Minski: There was an older gentleman who selected those people.

00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:46.708
David Boder: . . . from the outside, a German?

00:47:46.708 --> 00:47:49.171
Jacob Minski: . . . from the outside, a German in civilian clothes...

00:47:49.171 --> 00:47:50.064
David Boder: Yes...

00:47:50.064 --> 00:48:03.767
Jacob Minski: And we explained to him what we could do; and as a result of that, he assigned us to the right or to the left; that is, the people selected were to go to the right...

00:48:03.767 --> 00:48:06.713
David Boder: I see you wear glasses. Did you wear your glasses also in the lager?

00:48:06.713 --> 00:48:21.791
Jacob Minski: No. I did not have them. Unfortunately I had no glasses in the lager and consequently my eyes suffered a great deal. And I have changed my glasses here already about three times. And I am afraid that I shall have to change them for a fourth time because my eyes are very, very weak.

00:48:21.791 --> 00:48:24.960
David Boder: Well...What are you doing here now for the Joint?

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:28.643
Jacob Minski: I am here in the Filing Department...

00:48:28.643 --> 00:48:29.748
David Boder: Well...

00:48:29.748 --> 00:48:48.267
Jacob Minski: I...as said before, presented myself for this group. Fortunately the man from the Labor Division did not object; and since I addressed myself to the man in High German—so he had more confidence in me than in the others who were mostly Poles.

00:48:48.267 --> 00:48:49.897
David Boder: Yes, and spoke Yiddish.

00:48:49.897 --> 00:48:51.213
Jacob Minski: And spoke Yiddish.

00:48:51.213 --> 00:48:51.714
David Boder: Yes...

00:48:51.714 --> 00:48:59.440
Jacob Minski: I told him that I worked for the firm Hochstrom [?] and Associates; that was a large company for surface and underground construction...

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:00.165
David Boder: Was that true?

00:49:00.165 --> 00:49:05.736
Jacob Minski: That was true. I have never worked there [true apparently refers to the existence of such a firm] I only used it as a pretext to get out.

00:49:05.736 --> 00:49:06.310
David Boder: Aha...

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:12.455
Jacob Minski: You know if one is in such a lager, then every means is right and proper, only to get out of such an inferno.

00:49:12.455 --> 00:49:13.047
David Boder: Yes...

00:49:13.047 --> 00:49:18.468
Jacob Minski: I had some ‘pangs of conscience’. I thought that if I should be examined...

00:49:18.468 --> 00:49:19.029
David Boder: . . . Yes...

00:49:19.029 --> 00:49:20.237
Jacob Minski: . . . and fail to pass the examination...

00:49:20.237 --> 00:49:22.428
David Boder: Well, these were then not pangs of conscience—you were afraid...

00:49:22.428 --> 00:49:27.770
Jacob Minski: . . . Of course, I mean I was afraid. At the beginning I was not afraid, only when I was selected...

00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:28.072
David Boder: Yes...

00:49:28.072 --> 00:49:36.390
Jacob Minski: You see, I told the man that I had worked for the firm Hochstrom [?] and Associates, and this name of Hochstrom and Associates was sufficient for the man to...

00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:37.012
David Boder: [to have]...

00:49:37.012 --> 00:49:50.763
Jacob Minski: . . . to have certain confidence in me, and to assign me to the right with my colleague who accompanied me in all the lagers right from Hamburg. Also one of the few survivors with whom I was from the beginning [?]

00:49:50.763 --> 00:49:52.803
David Boder: And what was your colleague?

00:49:52.803 --> 00:49:54.584
Jacob Minski: He was a tinker [tinsmith]

00:49:54.584 --> 00:49:55.025
David Boder: Yes...

00:49:55.025 --> 00:49:57.488
Jacob Minski: Now for him it was much easier...

00:49:57.488 --> 00:49:58.472
David Boder: Yes...

00:49:58.472 --> 00:50:00.301
Jacob Minski: . . . because I was not an artisan.

00:50:00.301 --> 00:50:00.561
David Boder: Hm...

00:50:00.561 --> 00:50:18.658
Jacob Minski: Three hundred people were then selected from among us, and we were to leave already the next day. We were dragged around from block to block, into all kind of blocks, and in the last moment the block elder also embezzled our bread...

00:50:18.658 --> 00:50:19.159
David Boder: Yes...

00:50:19.159 --> 00:50:40.920
Jacob Minski: That is, the complete allotment—because he knew we would depart the next day, so he was able to embezzle the bread allotment for three hundred people. My...A friend of mine, a dentist who is now in Lodz, had the courage to demand the rations. For that...for the he ‘befogged’ him terribly and he was...

00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:43.081
David Boder: You mean he beat him up terribly? [He used the term Vernebelt, which sounds like a makeshift word meaning ‘befogged’ or ‘blacked him out.’]

00:50:43.081 --> 00:50:51.399
Jacob Minski: Yes. He thought that...that in the last moment since he was designated to leave [word not clear] he worked up courage and demanded the ration [s] for us all.

00:50:51.399 --> 00:50:52.413
David Boder: Yes...

00:50:52.413 --> 00:51:10.673
Jacob Minski: In response, the block elder ‘befogged’ him terribly, and he could not say a word, so that nothing worse would happen to him. We were then...We got a ration of breat—about 250 grams, a little piece of sausage, and we traveled then in open RR-cars...

00:51:10.673 --> 00:51:14.011
David Boder: Which portion of bread did you get then—the evening [ration] the regular one...?

00:51:14.011 --> 00:51:18.206
Jacob Minski: No, no, no. We got a ration that was [to be our] travel provision.

00:51:18.206 --> 00:51:18.659
David Boder: Yes...

00:51:18.659 --> 00:51:21.152
Jacob Minski: . . . and our regular ration he embezzled from us.

00:51:21.152 --> 00:51:22.045
David Boder: Well...

00:51:22.045 --> 00:51:31.583
Jacob Minski: The ration, the travel ration, we consumed in a half an hour because we did not have the ration of the evening before.

00:51:31.583 --> 00:51:32.205
David Boder: Yes...

00:51:32.205 --> 00:51:45.925
Jacob Minski: So we were very hungry. So we traveled for a day. The RR-cars were open, open on both sides; accompanied, escorted by two SS men.

00:51:45.925 --> 00:51:47.042
David Boder: That means the doors of the cars [were open] ?

00:51:47.042 --> 00:51:47.676
Jacob Minski: The doors, Yes...

00:51:47.676 --> 00:51:49.233
David Boder: But they were cattle cars?

00:51:49.233 --> 00:51:51.286
Jacob Minski: They were cattle cars which were open.

00:51:51.286 --> 00:51:56.435
David Boder: See Manuscript.

00:51:56.435 --> 00:52:06.986
Jacob Minski: And so we had a chance to breathe [fresh] air; and for us it was a certain comfort that we were already on...that we traveled. Through that we knew that we were not going into the oven.

00:52:06.986 --> 00:52:07.348
David Boder: Hm...

00:52:07.348 --> 00:52:10.970
Jacob Minski: We landed in Goerlitz...in Goerlitz...

00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:11.785
David Boder: Where is Goerlitz?

00:52:11.785 --> 00:52:12.962
Jacob Minski: Goerlitz is in Silesia...

00:52:12.962 --> 00:52:13.385
David Boder: Yes...

00:52:13.385 --> 00:52:32.055
Jacob Minski: . . . In the proximity of Breslau—about a hundred kilometers from Breslau. It is a peculiar feeling when one, after such a long time, sees a civilian person again. When one is in a concentration camp, I was already in ’38 in a concentration camp, in Oranienburg as a consequence of the murder of von Raat in Paris.

00:52:32.055 --> 00:52:32.447
David Boder: Yes...

00:52:32.447 --> 00:52:43.361
Jacob Minski: When all...a large part of the Jews were arrested; I mean, those that they could lay their hands on, and they were sent to Oranienburg...

00:52:43.361 --> 00:52:44.206
David Boder: Where is Oranienburg?

00:52:44.206 --> 00:52:46.560
Jacob Minski: Oranienburg is near...from Berlin about...

00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:46.711
David Boder: Yes...

00:52:46.711 --> 00:52:50.441
Jacob Minski: . . . A few kilometers from Berlin...

00:52:50.441 --> 00:52:53.339
David Boder: And when were you released from Oranienburg?

00:52:53.339 --> 00:52:58.790
Jacob Minski: I was then released from from Oranienburg? I was about ten weeks in Oranienburg...

00:52:58.790 --> 00:53:00.589
David Boder: Yes...

00:53:00.589 --> 00:53:10.114
Jacob Minski: Life there was not too ‘rosy,’ one may say. We were...the so to speak, ‘lager ripening’ [softening up for lager conditions]

00:53:10.114 --> 00:53:10.688
David Boder: Yes...

00:53:10.688 --> 00:53:31.139
Jacob Minski: . . . consisted [in the procedure] that upon arrival we had to stand about ten hours lined up before the barbed wires [fences] motionless—without moving. It was then...I don’t know anymore what time of the year it was [NOTE: in the winter of 1938-1939. DPB] At any rate, it was unbearable. Motionless. And up there...there...there were sentries in such towers [turrets]...

00:53:31.139 --> 00:53:31.229
David Boder: Yes...

00:53:31.229 --> 00:53:34.111
Jacob Minski: . . . These were such towers...

00:53:34.111 --> 00:53:36.254
David Boder: Yes...

00:53:36.254 --> 00:53:41.463
Jacob Minski: . . . and the sentries had to, of course, watch that...

00:53:41.463 --> 00:53:44.602
David Boder: . . . that you stand. And how many hours, do you say?

00:53:44.602 --> 00:53:47.137
Jacob Minski: Well, we stood then twenty-four hours.

00:53:47.137 --> 00:53:49.582
David Boder: That was called ‘lager ripening?’

00:53:49.582 --> 00:53:51.471
Jacob Minski: ‘Lager ripening.’

00:53:51.471 --> 00:53:53.222
David Boder: Were you given anything to eat?

00:53:53.222 --> 00:53:55.202
Jacob Minski: Yes. Afterwards.

00:53:55.202 --> 00:53:56.216
David Boder: That was in ’38?

00:53:56.216 --> 00:54:02.916
Jacob Minski: Yes. Then various persons were strapped to the rack; that is such a towerlike contraption.

00:54:02.916 --> 00:54:03.037
David Boder: Yes...

00:54:03.037 --> 00:54:03.912
Jacob Minski: . . . You know, these...

00:54:03.912 --> 00:54:04.516
David Boder: Yes...

00:54:04.516 --> 00:54:08.941
Jacob Minski: . . . and they got about twenty-five on the behind,...

00:54:08.941 --> 00:54:09.050
David Boder: Yes...

00:54:09.050 --> 00:54:10.426
Jacob Minski: . . . with an ox-pizzle [Ox-penis. German: Ochenziemer]

00:54:10.426 --> 00:54:10.788
David Boder: Yes...

00:54:10.788 --> 00:54:11.483
Jacob Minski: That means...

00:54:11.483 --> 00:54:12.527
David Boder: . . . an ox tail?

00:54:12.527 --> 00:54:14.187
Jacob Minski: . . . an ‘ox tail,’ yes [Footnote 5: The German word Schwanz means in regular parlance ‘a tail;’ in slang it stands for ‘penis.’ It was common in the Russian Czarist Army for higher officers, viz the Grand Duke Nikolas, to use a dryed and specially stretched ox penis as a riding crop, with which in moments of ‘noble ire’ they would strike even subordinate officers. The ox penis makes apparently not only a hardhitting whip, but a stroke with it implied a component of contempt for the victim.] .

00:54:14.187 --> 00:54:15.062
David Boder: Yes...

00:54:15.062 --> 00:54:20.465
Jacob Minski: That was, of course, unbearable. The skin on the buttocks [chuckle] would break. There were specially...

00:54:20.465 --> 00:54:21.841
David Boder: Did that happen also to you?

00:54:21.841 --> 00:54:22.445
Jacob Minski: No, it did not happen to me...

00:54:22.445 --> 00:54:23.882
David Boder: But you have seen it?

00:54:23.882 --> 00:54:33.709
Jacob Minski: Yes, we have seen it. Also for smoking at work they would...there were some prisoners who absolutely had to smoke.

00:54:33.709 --> 00:54:34.421
David Boder: Yes...

00:54:34.421 --> 00:54:45.709
Jacob Minski: They did it, of course, on the sly; and if they were caught they then got three...one or two hours of pole hanging.

00:54:45.709 --> 00:54:46.132
David Boder: What is that?

00:54:46.132 --> 00:55:00.396
Jacob Minski: That is, they were hanged on a pole by the hands tied behind; that is, the rope was pulled up so that only the tips of the toes touched the ground [Footnote 6: See the Bramson story. In 1946, this form of torture was demonstrated in Dachau to sightseers by means of a manikin apparently to demonstrate the deeds of the Nazis.]...

00:55:00.396 --> 00:55:01.169
David Boder: Yes.

00:55:01.169 --> 00:55:02.877
Jacob Minski: So he hung in this position...

00:55:02.877 --> 00:55:05.050
David Boder: But the tips of the toes could touch the ground?

00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:06.529
Jacob Minski: [With emphasis]...but only the tips of the toes.

00:55:06.529 --> 00:55:07.042
David Boder: Yes...

00:55:07.042 --> 00:55:13.984
Jacob Minski: You can imagine that when they cut him loose after two hours, he would collapse like a sack. You see? Because first of all...

00:55:13.984 --> 00:55:15.813
David Boder: Now, how high were the hands?

00:55:15.813 --> 00:55:20.388
Jacob Minski: The hands were pulled up as far as it would go—he floated in the air...

00:55:20.388 --> 00:55:21.656
David Boder: Yes...

00:55:21.656 --> 00:55:30.197
Jacob Minski: That was terribly painful...[as I was told] by those...who went through it themselves.

00:55:30.197 --> 00:55:31.012
David Boder: Well...

00:55:31.012 --> 00:55:47.928
Jacob Minski: That time reigned in Oranienburg, it was the worst...the worst cold prevailed that could ever be remembered. I worked at the canal that time and...we had to shovel sand under quota, into lorries.

00:55:47.928 --> 00:55:48.399
David Boder: Yes...

00:55:48.399 --> 00:55:57.471
Jacob Minski: . . . into such small lorries; and I only remember that my portion of bread, which I had in the side [?] pocket...

00:55:57.471 --> 00:55:57.773
David Boder: Yes...

00:55:57.773 --> 00:56:04.051
Jacob Minski: . . . of my prisoner’s suit, was frozen into ice. So you can imagine how cold it was. The wheels...the wheels would not turn anymore...

00:56:04.051 --> 00:56:05.035
David Boder: Of the lorries?

00:56:05.035 --> 00:57:04.184
Jacob Minski: . . . of the lorries. We were four people assigned to a lorry, regardless of whether old or young. At times the old people could barely stand up and we had to cart them in addition. And the that time lager leader, Bugdala, an SS man, the boxing champion of the SS, an infamous scoundrel...he spoke little, but when he slapped one’s face one tumbled over twice. And so I remember that I had to carry heavy rocks together with a colleague, and it was glazed ice [on the ground] and everything had to be done with running pace. And that, of course, is impossible. So he caught us once carrying the stuff at a walking pace, so he took down the numbers and we got then three hours ‘before the charged barbed wires’...We had to stand three hours...

00:57:04.184 --> 00:57:06.979
David Boder: What does that mean, ‘before the charged barbed wires?’ They had...It was...

00:57:06.979 --> 00:57:09.291
Jacob Minski: One could not touch it, because otherwise...

00:57:09.291 --> 00:57:09.611
David Boder: Yes...

00:57:09.611 --> 00:57:11.832
Jacob Minski: It was charged with ten thousand volts.

00:57:11.832 --> 00:57:13.040
David Boder: Well...

00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:16.951
Jacob Minski: So one had to stand motionless, after work. You see, that meant that after work...

00:57:16.951 --> 00:57:19.034
David Boder: But why before the charged barbed wire?

00:57:19.034 --> 00:57:22.674
Jacob Minski: That was such a...I don’t know...the reason.

00:57:22.674 --> 00:57:25.499
David Boder: Did something to anybody, did somebody...against...

00:57:25.499 --> 00:57:31.161
Jacob Minski: Many, many, of course sent to the barbed wire [made contact with the barbed wire] because they simply could not stand it anymore.

00:57:31.161 --> 00:57:32.779
David Boder: Oh...They threw themselves against it...?

00:57:32.779 --> 00:57:35.604
Jacob Minski: They threw themselves against it. They, of course, remained stuck to it.

00:57:35.604 --> 00:57:35.984
David Boder: Hm...

00:57:35.984 --> 00:57:52.795
Jacob Minski: You see...and they were dead. I still remember, at night...when we were driven at night in Oranienburg by the SS, and there was such a slope. And so we could not see that it was going downhill abruptly. The first one came stumbling...

00:57:52.795 --> 00:57:53.006
David Boder: Yes...

00:57:53.006 --> 00:58:05.365
Jacob Minski: . . . fell down...They...You can well imagine if two thousand people came in crowding so they could not get up so quickly, we trampled over them; so that we, right from the start, brought the first dead into the camp.

00:58:05.365 --> 00:58:10.122
David Boder: Yes...

00:58:10.122 --> 00:58:22.243
Jacob Minski: These were the little, painful memories...Yes, at times...Well, there were unfortunately humorous instances...

00:58:22.243 --> 00:58:23.800
David Boder: Yes. I should like to hear something about it.

00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:43.509
Jacob Minski: For instance, we had...we were at that time ten thousand people in Oranienburg, at my time. The lager elder was at that time member of the Reichstag, and we were always compelled to sing some songs. One would stand up on a platform...

00:58:43.509 --> 00:58:44.795
David Boder: Where? During work?

00:58:44.795 --> 00:58:47.710
Jacob Minski: No, no. After the end of work, when we entered the lager...

00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:47.982
David Boder: Yes...

00:58:47.982 --> 00:59:00.688
Jacob Minski: We had to...They made an appell—whether all were present. We once had...we had to stand for twelve hours because one man was absent; that is, he had hanged himself and we had to...we had to search for him.

00:59:00.688 --> 00:59:01.051
David Boder: Aha...

00:59:01.051 --> 00:59:01.461
Jacob Minski: And we still had...

00:59:01.461 --> 00:59:02.488
David Boder: And where was he found...?

00:59:02.488 --> 00:59:04.951
Jacob Minski: Oh somewhere...In a corner, he...

00:59:04.951 --> 00:59:06.116
David Boder: . . . hanged himself?

00:59:06.116 --> 00:59:14.042
Jacob Minski: If not...We simply had to stand until he was found, and even if we had to stand twenty-four or thirty-six hours...He had to be found.

00:59:14.042 --> 00:59:14.905
David Boder: And how long did you happen to stand?

00:59:14.905 --> 00:59:17.682
Jacob Minski: At that time...we stood twelve hours once...

00:59:17.682 --> 00:59:18.515
David Boder: Hm...

00:59:18.515 --> 00:59:18.835
Jacob Minski: And so it came...

00:59:18.835 --> 00:59:21.781
David Boder: Didn’t you have to go to work?

00:59:21.781 --> 00:59:25.843
Jacob Minski: In that case...That is, that depended...

00:59:25.843 --> 00:59:27.594
David Boder: Yes...

00:59:27.594 --> 00:59:40.349
Jacob Minski: Oh...Yes. Only at one Christmas we were not compelled to work for one day. That is, in place of that [work] we had to ‘do sports,’ drill.

00:59:40.349 --> 00:59:41.363
David Boder: What was that?

00:59:41.363 --> 00:59:47.550
Jacob Minski: Marching...Right, left, right, left...You see? In a military fashion...

00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:48.244
David Boder: Yes...

00:59:48.244 --> 01:00:02.369
Jacob Minski: . . . and my humble self, and a few others wanted to duck out, and reported that we had sore feet. So then one of the platoon leaders said, ‘Well, we shall then march slowly.’

01:00:02.369 --> 01:00:02.761
David Boder: Hm...

01:00:02.761 --> 01:00:18.873
Jacob Minski: But now there came an SS man walking up and down, and said [mocking his voice] ‘What is going on?’ This man [platoon leader] reported in military form, ‘These people can’t run.’—'What, they can’t run? Run, lie down; run, lie down;’ and so...

01:00:18.873 --> 01:00:19.857
David Boder: What does that mean?

01:00:19.857 --> 01:00:25.338
Jacob Minski: ‘Run, lie down,’ that means, you know, [first] running and then stretching out at full length. That was then in the winter, in the snow.

01:00:25.338 --> 01:00:26.533
David Boder: Yes...

01:00:26.533 --> 01:00:29.913
Jacob Minski: He made then his...his ‘sport’ with us.

01:00:29.913 --> 01:00:30.276
David Boder: That was...

01:00:30.276 --> 01:00:31.260
Jacob Minski: [A few words not clear]

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:33.119
David Boder: . . . in the lager in Oranienburg?

01:00:33.119 --> 01:00:35.413
Jacob Minski: Well, that was then...I am just telling short episodes...

01:00:35.413 --> 01:00:37.514
David Boder: [Not clear]

01:00:37.514 --> 01:00:43.930
Jacob Minski: Yes...And so I took advantage when a detail...

01:00:43.930 --> 01:00:45.953
David Boder: You said, you would tell some humorous...

01:00:45.953 --> 01:00:52.188
Jacob Minski: Oh yes...[chuckle] Unfortunately I went off the subject. I was telling about the singing.

01:00:52.188 --> 01:00:52.883
David Boder: Yes.

01:00:52.883 --> 01:00:59.933
Jacob Minski: And so they simply gave a theme, say, ‘It sat a birdie in the tree,’

01:00:59.933 --> 01:01:00.688
David Boder: Hm...

01:01:00.688 --> 01:01:06.954
Jacob Minski: So then I ask you, do you know the song? So you will give me the answer ‘No, I don’t know it.’ I don’t know it either.

01:01:06.954 --> 01:01:07.817
David Boder: Hm...

01:01:07.817 --> 01:01:10.715
Jacob Minski: Now you had to sing a song that you didn’t know.

01:01:10.715 --> 01:01:11.488
David Boder: Yes...

01:01:11.488 --> 01:01:20.017
Jacob Minski: Well, so an SS man passes by and sees that I am standing there—I am not participating in the singing [chuckle]

01:01:20.017 --> 01:01:20.440
David Boder: Yes...

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:40.227
Jacob Minski: So he says, ‘Why don’t you sing? So he answers, ‘I don’t know it.’—'What, you don’t know the song?’—So he slaps him over the snout and he says, ‘You should at least tear open your snout.’ And in the evening there was practice in the block; that is, we had to sing in the evening in the block a song which we did not know.

01:01:40.227 --> 01:01:41.301
David Boder: Yes...

01:01:41.301 --> 01:02:51.221
Jacob Minski: So you see, they demanded simply impossible things. You should sing a song that you don’t know. Of course...Just to return to the other topic—Since we did not know the terrain,...we were delivered and there were already...we already brought in the first dead. We had to line up before the charged barbed wire and an SS man passed from one to the other and inquired, ‘What is your profession?’ So he says...so one would say—’Physician.’ So then, ‘You have dishonored our women.’ You see...and he would slap him, a pair right and left. To another, ‘What are you?’—'A lawyer.’ So then, ‘You have done in [put in prison] many of ours, of our kind of people.’ So he too, got his face slapped twice. I could not understand one thing. Next to this lawyer stood a state’s attorney. Apparently he was so confused that he replied to his question about his profession, that he was a state’s attorney. So you can imagine what an effect it had on such an [SS] man. You understand?

01:02:51.221 --> 01:02:51.674
David Boder: Hm...

01:02:51.674 --> 01:03:43.521
Jacob Minski: A state’s attorney at that time! And so he told him, ‘You will be shot today with cat shit.’ Of course, you know how one felt. I don’t know what they later did with him. At any rate, they had...with people who were very stout they had special fun. They were ordered to make [play] stork. They were compelled to bend in order to pick up something. Of course a person with a big belly, and the clothes did not fit them well either; they had to fasten the prisoners’ garb with a rope so that the pants would hold. They knew, of course, that it was strictly prohibited to leave the block at night to eliminate. Of course, at the beginning that was not known and whoever would step out of the block was, of course, immediately shot down, because the...

01:03:43.521 --> 01:03:44.626
David Boder: In Oranienburg?

01:03:44.626 --> 01:03:51.435
Jacob Minski: In Oranienburg, because the kleg lights, those were the machine guns...

01:03:51.435 --> 01:03:51.815
David Boder: Hm...

01:03:51.815 --> 01:04:12.942
Jacob Minski: They illuminated every block; and as soon as something...if somebody somehow began to move in the yard he was immediately shot down. It also happened that the patrol which...the place...which guarded up, simply would attract a prisoner and tell him to come over there.

01:04:12.942 --> 01:04:13.214
David Boder: Yes...

01:04:13.214 --> 01:04:20.838
Jacob Minski: We were told that it was strictly prohibited to pass beyond the patrol line, since the patrol was to shoot immediately.

01:04:20.838 --> 01:04:22.184
David Boder: Aha...

01:04:22.184 --> 01:04:26.108
Jacob Minski: Many prisoners, uninformed about this...

01:04:26.108 --> 01:04:26.428
David Boder: . . . rule...

01:04:26.428 --> 01:04:32.663
Jacob Minski: . . . rule, followed unsuspectingly the ‘call’ and were, of course...

01:04:32.663 --> 01:04:33.086
David Boder: shot down...?

01:04:33.086 --> 01:04:39.171
Jacob Minski: . . . shot down. Yes, I was telling you about...

01:04:39.171 --> 01:04:45.044
David Boder: [A few words not clear] And so you went from Auschwitz. Where to?

01:04:45.044 --> 01:04:45.889
Jacob Minski: . . . to Goerlitz.

01:04:45.889 --> 01:04:48.455
David Boder: All right.

01:04:48.455 --> 01:04:57.377
Jacob Minski: I mean, from Goerlitz...In Goerlitz, that was a work lager. Of course, in comparison with Auschwitz, a paradise.

01:04:57.377 --> 01:04:58.482
David Boder: Yes...

01:04:58.482 --> 01:05:09.727
Jacob Minski: A work lager; it was an ammunition factory. We had to work at an ammunition factory as prisoners, always escorted by the SS. And evenings we were taken to the lager, returned.

01:05:09.727 --> 01:05:12.142
David Boder: The factory was outside the lager?

01:05:12.142 --> 01:05:13.186
Jacob Minski: . . . the factory was outside the lager.

01:05:13.186 --> 01:05:15.933
David Boder: . . . and you say that for the first time [since Auschwitz] you have seen other people.

01:05:15.933 --> 01:05:29.382
Jacob Minski: Yes, yes. That naturally was...it had an effect...It made a completely unusual impression on us. More so, that we worked with [free] civilian people. It was, of course, prohibited to talk to them. Still now and then one exchanged with them...

01:05:29.382 --> 01:05:29.672
David Boder: . . . a word?

01:05:29.672 --> 01:06:01.322
Jacob Minski: . . . a word. And since there were Frenchmen also working, and all possible nationalities. So there was a chance to get some bread now and then from them, or by the way of barter for cigarettes to acquire now and then some supplementary food. That appeared, however, less interesting than certain aspects of the life in the ghetto.

01:06:01.322 --> 01:06:02.306
David Boder: Where?

01:06:02.306 --> 01:06:04.829
Jacob Minski: I mean...if we speak again about Lodz.

01:06:04.829 --> 01:06:07.244
David Boder: [Not clear]

01:06:07.244 --> 01:06:47.013
Jacob Minski: I think, especially about the terrible hunger. The hunger was so great that we collected rotten potato peelings in order to convert them with saccharin into...a kind of mush. Thus a goo just fit to clog up the stomach. You see? And with it we got a little coffee grounds, with saccharin something that we called, cutlets, you see? Dry on the skillet...

01:06:47.013 --> 01:06:48.782
David Boder: Oh, out of the coffee grounds.

01:06:48.782 --> 01:06:58.911
Jacob Minski: . . . of the coffee grounds. Yes...of the coffee grounds, and two [tablets] of saccharin. Life was insanely expensive. We were getting one bread for the week.

01:06:58.911 --> 01:07:00.197
David Boder: . . . one bread?

01:07:00.197 --> 01:07:20.376
Jacob Minski: Yes, an entire bread. Thus, one had to distribute it in rations. You would get a bread of two kilos. Sometimes it did not weigh two full kilos. We...people made a special effort to get really stale bread. A fresh bread stimulated the appetite and that was dangerous.

01:07:20.376 --> 01:07:20.738
David Boder: Hm...

01:07:20.738 --> 01:07:32.130
Jacob Minski: One pleaded [for a special favor] the exact opposite of [the attitude] today [chuckle] One pleaded for very stale bread so that one would not eat so much.

01:07:32.130 --> 01:07:32.601
David Boder: Yes...

01:07:32.601 --> 01:07:37.086
Jacob Minski: And so, I generally distributed it for myself, so that everyday I would eat about two slices...

01:07:37.086 --> 01:07:37.949
David Boder: Yes...

01:07:37.949 --> 01:07:59.380
Jacob Minski: And now and then I managed a loan [chuckle] so that the last three days I had no more bread [He apparently means that he loaned the bread to others] The prices corresponded...It was this way for a long time, that the values of objects...in general, had no special values, while foodstuffs...

01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:00.014
David Boder: . . . were expensive...?

01:08:00.014 --> 01:08:18.955
Jacob Minski: . . . had an unbelievable value. I remember, for instance, I had a new suit of clothes with me among other things—a new suit of clothes for which I paid 350 Marks in Hamburg. So you see, it was quite a piece of wealth. And I got one kilo of flour for it.

01:08:18.955 --> 01:08:20.676
David Boder: Hm...

01:08:20.676 --> 01:09:02.165
Jacob Minski: You could purchase a pair...a pair of shoes for a hundred grams of margarine; and you see that from these prices things, objects other than food or cigarettes, were worth nothing. And they could...the Germans who...who would at times come into the ghetto with one pound of bread or margarine, would afterwards leave with a trunkful of new things. [As often in these interviews a flashback occurs without warning] Then, for the sake of saving one’s life, one was ready to sacrifice all these things. I, too, was at one time...I was so run down from hunger that I barely could do my duties...I was twice...I remember, I was twice brought home in a state of faint...

01:09:02.165 --> 01:09:02.889
David Boder: As fireman [in Lodz]

01:09:02.889 --> 01:09:19.180
Jacob Minski: As fireman, because I was actually too weak. When I looked at myself at times in the mirror I saw death before my eyes. I remember from these times, there were one hundred and sixty-five thousand Jews at the beginning, and they came down to forty thousand Jews.

01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:21.263
David Boder: Well, many were, of course, deported...?

01:09:21.263 --> 01:09:26.442
Jacob Minski: Many were deported, but a large part died from typhus. The...

01:09:26.442 --> 01:09:32.961
David Boder: Now tell me, did you know a Dr. Falk there in Lodz, in Lodz [a cousin of the interviewer] ?

01:09:32.961 --> 01:09:34.440
Jacob Minski: It is possible. You see, I have no more...

01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:37.368
David Boder: You don’t remember?

01:09:37.368 --> 01:10:16.821
Jacob Minski: I cannot remember for sure. First of all, the housing conditions were terrible. There was...They have selected for the Lodz Ghetto the worst...the worst section of Lodz; that is, where the worst skum had lived before. Those were mostly broken down dwellings; and people [in the Ghetto] lived under the most frightful conditions. At times the people lived ten families in one flat. You can imagine what the results were under these most horrible hygienic conditions.

01:10:16.821 --> 01:10:17.231
David Boder: Could you...

01:10:17.231 --> 01:10:27.191
Jacob Minski: When one, for instance, was in need of something...It was very hard...say medicines. One had to get it by way of so-called undercover trade [sneak trade]

01:10:27.191 --> 01:10:28.459
David Boder: Hm...

01:10:28.459 --> 01:10:36.324
Jacob Minski: The price was, of course, prohibitive. For instance as fireman I earned three marks, three ghetto marks...

01:10:36.324 --> 01:10:37.682
David Boder: Per day?

01:10:37.682 --> 01:10:39.644
Jacob Minski: Three ghetto marks per day.

01:10:39.644 --> 01:10:40.006
David Boder: Yes...

01:10:40.006 --> 01:11:05.060
Jacob Minski: The cost of a bread on the black market—one thousand eight hundred marks. You can then imagine how much bread I could buy for it [three marks] The bread...the soup, the water soup that one got for it, corresponded to a ‘dollar course.’ If there were plenty of potatoes, if the Germans would send in [to the Ghetto] plenty of potatoes, then the soup would fall [in price] say from fifty marks—it would at times reach a ‘quotation’ of fifty marks -

01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:06.195
David Boder: Yes...

01:11:06.195 --> 01:11:11.404
Jacob Minski: . . . down to a price of two fifty...

01:11:11.404 --> 01:11:14.513
David Boder: But you were to get some soup ‘for free?’

01:11:14.513 --> 01:11:18.334
Jacob Minski: Yes...The soup [a portion] we got ‘for free.’ But, let us say one had diarrhea or something else...

01:11:18.334 --> 01:11:18.714
David Boder: Yes...

01:11:18.714 --> 01:11:20.676
Jacob Minski: So he would sell it.

01:11:20.676 --> 01:11:21.249
David Boder: Yes...

01:11:21.249 --> 01:11:28.131
Jacob Minski: Thus, there always stood before the kitchen a kind of trader [middle-man] who would buy up...

01:11:28.131 --> 01:11:28.481
David Boder: Yes...

01:11:28.481 --> 01:11:31.861
Jacob Minski: . . . the tickets...the soup tickets for a certain price;...

01:11:31.861 --> 01:11:32.193
David Boder: Yes...

01:11:32.193 --> 00:00:00.000
Jacob Minski: In order [to resell it] to another, a hungry one, who say [had sold] something else.

00:00:00.000 --> 01:11:34.638
David Boder: Yes...

01:11:34.638 --> 01:11:41.882
Jacob Minski: Say he had sold a piece of bread...There were people of a rather peculiar point of view. They would sell a bread for one thousand eight hundred marks—their own bread...

01:11:41.882 --> 01:11:42.262
David Boder: Well...

01:11:42.262 --> 01:11:44.988
Jacob Minski: And bought preferably for it, soups, in order to stuff their belly full.

01:11:44.988 --> 01:11:45.821
David Boder: Yes...

01:11:45.821 --> 01:11:47.409
Jacob Minski: That was, of course...

01:11:47.409 --> 01:11:48.423
David Boder: Yes...

01:11:48.423 --> 01:12:05.928
Jacob Minski: . . . from a standpoint of health completely wrong. Thus, if they wanted to buy something equivalent to two, three hundred marks, they would sell a piece of bread. He weighed it...

01:12:05.928 --> 01:12:06.411
David Boder: Yes...

01:12:06.411 --> 01:12:12.437
Jacob Minski: . . . as if he would weigh gold; and the bill was then settled with bread.

01:12:12.437 --> 01:12:14.278
David Boder: Will you permit me a question?

01:12:14.278 --> 01:12:15.093
Jacob Minski: Yes.

01:12:15.093 --> 01:12:28.825
David Boder: Could you tell me anything about...about the sex life from the time in Lodz and afterwards in the lager?

01:12:28.825 --> 01:12:44.742
Jacob Minski: Well [pause] that was, of course, an unhealthy situation since male and female were housed together...you understand; I would almost say the people were not ashamed [embarrassed] at all.

01:12:44.742 --> 01:12:45.950
David Boder: Yes...

01:12:45.950 --> 01:12:46.934
Jacob Minski: They lived a complete...

01:12:46.934 --> 01:12:49.336
David Boder: Now let us say, when one family lived together...

01:12:49.336 --> 01:12:51.389
Jacob Minski: Yes...

01:12:51.389 --> 01:12:53.973
David Boder: How did they go about sexual intercourse?

01:12:53.973 --> 01:12:58.216
Jacob Minski: I would almost say, completely without embarrassment. Because the people...I remember we were...

01:12:58.216 --> 01:13:00.208
David Boder: . . . in the presence of the children?

01:13:00.208 --> 01:13:26.122
Jacob Minski: I remember, when we came from Hamburg a certain group of us took lodging somewhere. We were eight people, among them one woman. And she did not show embarrassment at all. She undressed completely naked in order to wash. And the people became in time...the same as in the lager. The life in the lager has, of course, made the people so to speak, hardsensed [devoid of sensibilities—feellings. See story of Roma Tscharnobroda]

01:13:26.122 --> 01:13:26.786
David Boder: Yes...

01:13:26.786 --> 01:13:30.559
Jacob Minski: Completely devoid of feelings. One did not feel anything. Let us say, when at night...

01:13:30.559 --> 01:13:32.297
David Boder: You mean to say, without a sex drive?

01:13:32.297 --> 01:13:45.909
Jacob Minski: Without any sex drive. Because the hunger...You should not forget that when the hunger is so intense, then one, I would say, does not think about it. I believe that one who is satiated could have such thoughts rather than the one...one who is starving. That comes; first of all the stomach must be full. ( It may be pertinent here to sum up the answer to a question most often asked: The sex drive was suppressed by protracted starvation and a continuous state of terror. )

01:13:45.909 --> 01:13:46.030
David Boder: Yes...

01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:50.907
Jacob Minski: And so...

01:13:50.907 --> 01:13:52.265
David Boder: So that was no problem.

01:13:52.265 --> 01:14:08.473
Jacob Minski: With me, you understand, that was no problem. It was indeed no problem. Whatever the people...possibly...Of course, if one worked in a bread factory he could always save himself a piece of bread...

01:14:08.473 --> 01:14:08.763
David Boder: [Not clear]

01:14:08.763 --> 01:14:12.946
Jacob Minski: And you know, with a piece of bread...that was a fortune.

01:14:12.946 --> 01:14:13.399
David Boder: Well...

01:14:13.399 --> 01:14:17.733
Jacob Minski: With a piece of bread he could buy anything. I know, at the beginning when I came into the Ghetto...

01:14:17.733 --> 01:14:18.397
David Boder: Let us return to the sex question [?]

01:14:18.397 --> 01:14:28.616
Jacob Minski: . . . prostitution was so intense. On the street, for instance, girls would cling to you for a piece of bread. For a slice of bread...

01:14:28.616 --> 01:14:29.703
David Boder: Yes...Jewish girls?

01:14:29.703 --> 01:14:31.864
Jacob Minski: Jewish girls, of course. We were in the Ghetto.

01:14:31.864 --> 01:14:33.301
David Boder: So where could they go?

01:14:33.301 --> 00:00:00.000
Jacob Minski: They would...would go into a yard or somewhere. Possibly the mother was working, so the daughter...

00:00:00.000 --> 01:14:42.150
David Boder: Yes...

01:14:42.150 --> 01:14:41.800
Jacob Minski: . . . would use the opportunity...

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:42.150
David Boder: Yes.

01:14:42.150 --> 01:14:48.959
Jacob Minski: Of course, later this led to misfortune; because the girls who were not working were, of course, in time deported.

01:14:48.959 --> 01:14:49.309
David Boder: Yes.

01:14:49.309 --> 01:14:50.667
Jacob Minski: Who was not registered...

01:14:50.667 --> 01:14:51.361
David Boder: . . . as a worker?

01:14:51.361 --> 01:15:06.724
Jacob Minski: . . . One had to be registered in some kind of industry. Since he was not registered...As an unemployed...every unemployed, as well as people who had committed the slightest offense, were deported.

01:15:06.724 --> 01:15:11.299
David Boder: Now let us return [to the original question] Let us say, a block elder in the lager...

01:15:11.299 --> 01:15:11.631
Jacob Minski: Yes...

01:15:11.631 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: . . . who had enough to eat.

00:00:00.000 --> 01:15:12.959
Jacob Minski: Yes...

01:15:12.959 --> 01:15:18.362
David Boder: . . . Have you any idea how he satisfied his sex needs?

01:15:18.362 --> 01:15:25.292
Jacob Minski: About that I must tell you [a chuckle] I did not make myself any headaches, since one had so many worries...

01:15:25.292 --> 01:15:25.552
David Boder: Yes...

01:15:25.552 --> 01:15:29.886
Jacob Minski: . . . that one...that one thought about it less as one [could imagine]

01:15:29.886 --> 01:15:30.309
David Boder: Well...Yes...

01:15:30.309 --> 01:15:38.536
Jacob Minski: Of course, it was known...Later on I learned at the [word not clear] that many block elders had such boys...

01:15:38.536 --> 01:15:38.989
David Boder: . . . had boys...?

01:15:38.989 --> 01:15:47.681
Jacob Minski: . . . had boys, with whom they amused themselves. I know...there were children from ten to twelve years old.

01:15:47.681 --> 01:15:49.432
David Boder: And what kind of children were these?

01:15:49.432 --> 01:15:53.102
Jacob Minski: . . . They had them...These, too, were prisoners.

01:15:53.102 --> 01:15:53.434
David Boder: Yes...

01:15:53.434 --> 01:16:02.005
Jacob Minski: . . . They were actually supposed to go to work, but they always found a pretext to retain them in the lager. A block elder could, of course, do that.

01:16:02.005 --> 01:16:02.609
David Boder: . . . and...

01:16:02.609 --> 01:16:05.899
Jacob Minski: . . . He would be registered as sick, and then...

01:16:05.899 --> 01:16:07.679
David Boder: . . . then he would be retained?

01:16:07.679 --> 01:16:10.263
Jacob Minski: . . . and then the block elder would retain him.

01:16:10.263 --> 01:16:15.804
David Boder: Well. Now let us return to the general situation in the Ghetto of Lodz.

01:16:15.804 --> 01:16:16.438
Jacob Minski: The Ghetto of Lodz...

01:16:16.438 --> 01:16:20.422
David Boder: Or let us say it this way. Where were you liberated?

01:16:20.422 --> 01:16:28.861
Jacob Minski: Yes. I was liberated indirectly by the Russians, because I had left earlier...I left the lager one day early...It was already...

01:16:28.861 --> 01:16:29.362
David Boder: Where was that?

01:16:29.362 --> 01:16:30.479
Jacob Minski: In Goerlitz...

01:16:30.479 --> 01:16:31.433
David Boder: Goerlitz, where was that?

01:16:31.433 --> 01:16:36.190
Jacob Minski: That is in Silesia. I told you already, about one hundred kilometers from Brelau...

01:16:36.190 --> 01:16:36.299
David Boder: Yes.

01:16:36.299 --> 01:16:40.603
Jacob Minski: The Russians were entrenched already, for weeks, at about eleven kilometers from Goerlitz.

01:16:40.603 --> 01:16:41.104
David Boder: Yes...

01:16:41.104 --> 01:16:49.947
Jacob Minski: And strangely enough they did not advance further. They remained entrenched there, I believe, for about ten weeks.

01:16:49.947 --> 01:16:50.780
David Boder: Yes...

01:16:50.780 --> 01:17:04.410
Jacob Minski: And one never knew...I only remember that the people from the factory often approached in automobiles almost up to the line where the Russians were, in order to fetch materials. It was completely incomprehensible to me how they could do it.

01:17:04.410 --> 01:17:08.865
David Boder: That must have been a form of Sitzkrieg [sitting war]

01:17:08.865 --> 01:17:34.615
Jacob Minski: Yes. A kind of Sitzkrieg. They just did not advance. But certain preparations were made. We were already twice in flight from the Russians; that is...an order was given to us...to the lager...to evacuate the lager since, of course, the Russians were someday bound to march into the lager...They did not want that any evidence be left against them [against the Germans]

01:17:34.615 --> 01:17:35.038
David Boder: Yes.

01:17:35.038 --> 01:17:45.378
Jacob Minski: And so we found ourselves on the march; and unfortunately a great number of our prisoners were shot down, especially by the Ukrainian SS who hardly spoke a word of German...

01:17:45.378 --> 01:17:46.887
David Boder: Why?

01:17:46.887 --> 01:18:15.975
Jacob Minski: . . . because they could not walk. ‘Everything’ that could not walk was shot down on the road. At times, loaded on a truck and en route graves were dug in a forest. And I remember one day I was assigned to a commando [detail] to dig; that is, to excavate, to dig graves.

01:18:15.975 --> 01:18:16.657
David Boder: How come. [?]

01:18:16.657 --> 01:18:20.671
Jacob Minski: . . . a detail of fifty people who had to dig graves in order to...

01:18:20.671 --> 01:18:21.426
David Boder: . . . to bury...

01:18:21.426 --> 01:18:58.374
Jacob Minski: . . . to bury the dead from the jorney. Now the following would happen. The prisoners who were unable to march—of course, they couldn’t...They did not want to let them remain simply laying shot down on the street; and so they [the exhausted prisoners] were loaded on a truck and together with the dead; they were then shot in the nearest forest and buried with them. Thus, I remember an SS man. He was twenty-four years old [who] made the impression of an innocent...[chuckle]

01:18:58.374 --> 01:18:58.845
David Boder: . . . youth?

01:18:58.845 --> 01:19:13.893
Jacob Minski: . . . youth; as if he could not count to three. And he was the champion marksman. Every day he used to shoot down about thirty-forty [people]—he himself helped to dig the grave.

01:19:13.893 --> 01:19:15.070
David Boder: Yes...And what for?

01:19:15.070 --> 01:19:24.949
Jacob Minski: . . . Probably...that was...for him it was a kind of sport. Then he ordered the dead placed in them, counted up how much room he still had left.

01:19:24.949 --> 01:19:25.359
David Boder: Yes...

01:19:25.359 --> 01:19:49.945
Jacob Minski: . . . And then he ordered those innocent, unsuspecting people to get off the truck, saying ‘Step down’ [the word is apparently in Ukrainian and is a tentative translation] They had to step forward; and he would shoot them down with the carbine—trampling [holding down] the person’s head with his foot. And so one after the other had to look on how...You can, of course, [imagine] how...[the speech tapers off]

01:19:49.945 --> 01:19:51.955
David Boder: Was that a Ukrainian?

01:19:51.955 --> 01:19:54.762
Jacob Minski: That was a Ukrainian SS.

01:19:54.762 --> 01:19:56.108
David Boder: Yes, now then...

01:19:56.108 --> 01:20:18.779
Jacob Minski: He was one of the people who were subsequently sent away at the last moment, apparently out of fear that the Russians...that they may fall in the hands of the Russians...The whole Ukrainian SS attached [to this service] were sent away—were sent away. They were frightful [people]—they were the worst evil.

01:20:18.779 --> 01:20:26.024
David Boder: Well, now tell me this...Now where were you liberated?

01:20:26.024 --> 01:20:33.238
Jacob Minski: Oh, yes. And so one day before, on the 7th of August...

01:20:33.238 --> 01:20:34.011
David Boder: Yes.

01:20:34.011 --> 01:20:59.309
Jacob Minski: The Russians marched in, about the 8th of August—the 8th-9th. We got out of the lager. We could do already whatever we pleased. It was a change of affairs after the lager.leader had explained to us that we were practically free...We could remain in the block...in the lager.

01:20:59.309 --> 01:21:01.742
David Boder: Was the lager leader a prisoner?

01:21:01.742 --> 01:21:03.812
Jacob Minski: No, he was an SS.

01:21:03.812 --> 01:21:05.503
David Boder: And he did not run away?

01:21:05.503 --> 01:21:21.276
Jacob Minski: He...I really must say, that as an exception he had behaved, so to speak, comparatively decent; that is, I have never seen him touching a prisoner. Such was the lager elder—he was a super-gangster.

01:21:21.276 --> 01:21:22.743
David Boder: He was a prisoner?

01:21:22.743 --> 01:21:26.051
Jacob Minski: This one was a prisoner. But he was not a Jewish prisoner.

01:21:26.051 --> 01:21:31.170
David Boder: Now what did this SS man say?

01:21:31.170 --> 01:21:40.182
Jacob Minski: He said that we were actually free. If we desired we could go over to the Americans...

01:21:40.182 --> 01:21:40.725
David Boder: Yes...

01:21:40.725 --> 01:21:45.494
Jacob Minski: . . . and who wanted to remain with the Russians could remain in the lager. And from...

01:21:45.494 --> 01:21:49.949
David Boder: But he did say that the place [?] was being abandoned?

01:21:49.949 --> 01:21:57.241
Jacob Minski: Yes. After that [?] there was already such a confusion that everybody did what he pleased.

01:21:57.241 --> 01:21:57.863
David Boder: Aha.

01:21:57.863 --> 01:22:10.104
Jacob Minski: There was...The army was in retreat and en route...I was still with various colleagues [of mine] so we crossed all of Czechoslovakia...

01:22:10.104 --> 01:22:11.312
David Boder: So you went away...

01:22:11.312 --> 01:22:16.069
Jacob Minski: We got away, and in an SS truck at that.

01:22:16.069 --> 01:22:17.385
David Boder: In an SS auto?

01:22:17.385 --> 01:22:33.822
Jacob Minski: Yes...No, no, no—with horse and wagon [chuckle] We took it. It was still full of provisions, and with all real SS boots and all possible [things] And so we crossed the whole of Czechoslovakia, until we arrived in Vienna...

01:22:33.822 --> 01:22:35.681
David Boder: [Chuckle] And nobody stopped you, nobody...?

01:22:35.681 --> 00:00:00.000
Jacob Minski: . . . Of course, en route we met the Russians. They saw that they were dealing with prisoners so they were...They always let us pass. We then arrived in Vienna. That is, on the way we were, of course, very well received by the population. And you can imagine what a moment it was for us to enjoy freedom after we had given up the thought that we would ever get away.

00:00:00.000 --> 01:23:13.188
David Boder: Hm...

01:23:13.188 --> 01:23:15.004
Jacob Minski: As said before, we arrived in Vienna; and in Vienna we were not permitted to remain...[NOTE: The spool, as often happens, ends abruptly in mid-sentence. The interviewer apparently felt that it would be of little use to continue with a new spool, since the post-liberation phase was reasonably cleared up at the start of the interview; and the interviewee himself seems to have felt that there was not much to add. —D.P.B.]
