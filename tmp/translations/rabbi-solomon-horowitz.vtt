00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.330
David Boder: [In English] 1,2,3...1,2,3...1,2,3.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.392
David Boder: [In Yiddish] What is your name, sir?

00:00:14.392 --> 00:00:26.517
David Boder: [In English] Spool 125, taken in Hénonville, near Paris in a Kibbutz which is maintained by the Agudah. Yes.

00:00:26.517 --> 00:00:27.017
Solomon Horowitz: [Word not clear.]

00:00:27.017 --> 00:01:17.555
David Boder: Yes. It is a cooperative arrangement between the World ORT which handles the teaching of various trades and agriculture and the Agudah which maintains the place and seems to own this wonderful chateau...chateau of old, rich Frenchman, abandoned rather in a bad state of disrepair, because the ceiling are high. The...to paint it and to paper it would probably cost as much as the triple number of apartments in America where the same number of people could live. And so we have Mr. Solomon Horowitz who is the Rabbi in the place.

00:01:17.555 --> 00:01:25.656
David Boder: [In Yiddish] And so, Rabbi...Rabbi, would you tell me again what is your name and how old are you?

00:01:25.656 --> 00:01:29.266
Solomon Horowitz: I am, in the year nineteen...

00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:30.000
David Boder: What is your name?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.109
Solomon Horowitz: Solomon Horowitz.

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.859
David Boder: Yes?

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:33.515
Solomon Horowitz: Born in nineteen nine.

00:01:33.515 --> 00:01:34.390
David Boder: Nineteen...when?

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.374
Solomon Horowitz: Nineteen nine.

00:01:35.374 --> 00:01:36.468
David Boder: Nineteen nine?

00:01:36.468 --> 00:01:37.156
Solomon Horowitz: Nine.

00:01:37.156 --> 00:01:39.347
David Boder: So you are quite young. You are thirty-seven years old.

00:01:39.347 --> 00:01:40.800
Solomon Horowitz: Yes, yes, thirty-seven years.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:58.940
David Boder: [In English] All right. The Rabbi looks very well. He has a medium length beard and has a very good complexion...here in the country. [In Yiddish] And so go on. Would you tell me, Rabbi, what had happened to you? Where were you when the war started?

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:17.006
Solomon Horowitz: When the war started I was the Rabbi in Potok-Zloty. That is in the region of Galicia, near Tarnopol, Tarnopol Woje[wodstwo] region of Tarnopol. There I have...there were immediately deported from my little town...

00:02:17.006 --> 00:02:23.030
David Boder: And so let us not go so fast. The war started. Who entered? What kind of soldiers entered?

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.376
Solomon Horowitz: The Germans, the Germans, the Germans.

00:02:24.376 --> 00:02:25.251
David Boder: The Germans entered.

00:02:25.251 --> 00:02:26.173
Solomon Horowitz: The Germans entered.

00:02:26.173 --> 00:02:27.892
David Boder: Nu, and what did they...

00:02:27.892 --> 00:02:29.510
Solomon Horowitz: Immediately deported the entire little town...

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.010
David Boder: But...

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.807
Solomon Horowitz: ‘Jews, out!’

00:02:30.807 --> 00:02:33.209
David Boder: And so you would describe...

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:33.647
Solomon Horowitz: Yes.

00:02:33.647 --> 00:02:34.709
David Boder: . . . the procedure.

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:35.225
Solomon Horowitz: Yes.

00:02:35.225 --> 00:02:45.354
David Boder: How were people deported? Did they say...well, how was it? What did they say to the Jews? To whom of the Jews did they speak? Did you have an administration? How did the entire thing come about?

00:02:45.354 --> 00:02:48.783
Solomon Horowitz: They immediately organized a kind of a Jewish council.

00:02:48.783 --> 00:02:49.330
David Boder: Yes?

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.630
Solomon Horowitz: It was called...There they took in a few people...

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.489
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:03.867
Solomon Horowitz: And the people...They demanded from these people that they should put at their disposal a registration of each Jew, of all the possessions on hand.

00:03:03.867 --> 00:03:05.102
David Boder: Hm.

00:03:05.102 --> 00:03:07.384
Solomon Horowitz: It was done that way. They registered.

00:03:07.384 --> 00:03:09.901
David Boder: How many Jews were there in your town, in your...

00:03:09.901 --> 00:03:11.556
Solomon Horowitz: Fourteen...fourteen hundred persons.

00:03:11.556 --> 00:03:12.600
David Boder: All together fourteen hundred persons?

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.694
Solomon Horowitz: Fourteen hundred persons. Yes.

00:03:13.694 --> 00:03:16.038
David Boder: Hm. And how many Christians were there?

00:03:16.038 --> 00:03:19.350
Solomon Horowitz: Christians, there were three times as many.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.390
David Boder: You figure that the Jews were approximately...

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.749
Solomon Horowitz: A quarter, a quarter, a quarter.

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:24.374
David Boder: A quarter. Yes, nu?

00:03:24.374 --> 00:03:36.514
Solomon Horowitz: Then they ordered the Jewish councils, and they registered all the Jews. And it was ordered that in fourteen days there should not be found a Jew in that little town.

00:03:36.514 --> 00:03:38.578
David Boder: Oh! They wanted to make this little town Jew-clean?

00:03:38.578 --> 00:03:39.281
Solomon Horowitz: Jew-clean.

00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:39.781
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:39.781 --> 00:03:47.749
Solomon Horowitz: Where do the Jews have to go? To the county seat, to a larger town which is eighteen kilometers away. The name of it is Buczacz.

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:48.233
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:48.233 --> 00:03:51.933
Solomon Horowitz: Buczacz was the county seat of Potok-Zloty, of my town [?]. In Buczacz were concentrated from the entire region around sixteen thousand Jews, gathered together...

00:03:51.933 --> 00:03:52.527
David Boder: Hm.

00:03:52.527 --> 00:04:02.374
Solomon Horowitz: . . . in that town. In that town proper a ghetto was created. It was ordered that in such and such a street all the Jews have to be.

00:04:02.374 --> 00:04:03.249
David Boder: Oh. A ghetto was made in that town.

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:04.484
Solomon Horowitz: In that town. In that street.

00:04:04.484 --> 00:04:06.702
David Boder: How many streets? One single street?

00:04:06.702 --> 00:04:07.389
Solomon Horowitz: One or two.

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:08.858
David Boder: Two. That means sixteen thousand...

00:04:08.858 --> 00:04:11.705
Solomon Horowitz: Sixteen thousand. It was indeed terrible. Indeed the Polish [?] Jews were lying in the street.

00:04:11.705 --> 00:04:12.314
David Boder: Yes?

00:04:12.314 --> 00:04:13.064
Solomon Horowitz: It was terrible.

00:04:13.064 --> 00:04:15.979
David Boder: What time of the year was it, Rabbi?

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:18.792
Solomon Horowitz: In the year ’40.

00:04:18.792 --> 00:04:21.370
David Boder: No, I mean which, winter, summer? When was it?

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:30.503
Solomon Horowitz: In the middle of the winter, in blizzards they ordered to...When we went the snow was terrible. Jews froze on the carts [word not clear] from cold. In the severest frosts.

00:04:30.503 --> 00:04:31.034
David Boder: Nu?

00:04:31.034 --> 00:04:34.456
Solomon Horowitz: And in Buczacz again was created a Jewish council.

00:04:34.456 --> 00:04:35.019
David Boder: Hm.

00:04:35.019 --> 00:04:53.146
Solomon Horowitz: Again a Jewish council. And the Jewish council was ordered to gather together all the gold and silver. Whoever has even a deka of gold, even a ring, no matter what, should be brought immediately. We went around. I, too, was one who went to collect from all the Jews all the gold in possession. We thought with that gold we might save ourselves for a certain time and will be allowed to live.

00:04:53.146 --> 00:04:55.271
David Boder: So did you give the gold or...

00:04:55.271 --> 00:05:14.545
Solomon Horowitz: Everything. There didn’t remain an iota [?]. I myself went along in order that it should be...should be handled honestly. I as Rabbi, because those members of the Jewish council were scum...Some were scoundrels [?], not such clean, decent people. Because usually he [the German], when he had to take people and go and rob...rob the...his [own] brothers, he took the scum, low elements. In spite of that I went along so that the gold should be delivered. We thought that with this gold we will save ourselves a little, for a certain time.

00:05:14.545 --> 00:05:15.889
David Boder: Nu, I will tell you...

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:16.264
Solomon Horowitz: Yes.

00:05:16.264 --> 00:05:20.646
David Boder: There is another point of view. Maybe they were told, the people that went along into the Jewish council...

00:05:20.646 --> 00:05:21.411
Solomon Horowitz: Yes?

00:05:21.411 --> 00:05:27.858
David Boder: . . . that if...if one should give in to the Germans a little they will not be that bad.

00:05:27.858 --> 00:05:29.789
Solomon Horowitz: That is what we did. That is...that is how we figured. That is how we figured.

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:31.320
David Boder: Were you in the Jewish council?

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.830
Solomon Horowitz: No. I was not in the Jewish council. I was outside the Jewish council, but the Jewish council usually summoned me as...as an individual, as a religious dignitary.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:36.830
David Boder: Yes, yes.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.711
Solomon Horowitz: Religious dignitary. I was of the opinion that we should give them the gold and silver. I was of such opinion because...so that we should save ourselves.

00:05:40.711 --> 00:05:41.601
David Boder: Yes.

00:05:41.601 --> 00:05:48.921
Solomon Horowitz: [Words not clear.] As soon as they collected the gold and silver — it took abut fourteen days — there came again the Gestapo from Czortkow, from [by order of] the higher authorities...

00:05:48.921 --> 00:05:49.562
David Boder: Hm.

00:05:49.562 --> 00:05:52.870
Solomon Horowitz: . . . and demanded a contingent of people.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:53.417
David Boder: Yes?

00:05:53.417 --> 00:05:59.683
Solomon Horowitz: It was ordered [?] that as long as there is no more gold and silver, as we have no more possessions, we should hand over for instance, five hundred people to...to be killed.

00:05:59.683 --> 00:06:00.667
David Boder: To be killed?

00:06:00.667 --> 00:06:03.058
Solomon Horowitz: To be killed. [Word not clear.] At first he said to be evacuated.

00:06:03.058 --> 00:06:04.193
David Boder: Not for labor? Not to be arrested [?]?

00:06:04.193 --> 00:06:05.147
Solomon Horowitz: No. To be killed.

00:06:05.147 --> 00:06:06.054
David Boder: It was said so?

00:06:06.054 --> 00:06:07.101
Solomon Horowitz: Said openly!

00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:08.101
David Boder: Said openly?

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:12.412
Solomon Horowitz: Twelve hundred sould have to be handed over to be killed. It was ordered [?] that a contingent of people...

00:06:12.412 --> 00:06:14.232
David Boder: What did you say was the name of that little town?

00:06:14.232 --> 00:06:14.994
Solomon Horowitz: Buczacz.

00:06:14.994 --> 00:06:15.834
David Boder: Buczacz?

00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:16.347
Solomon Horowitz: Buczacz.

00:06:16.347 --> 00:06:18.089
David Boder: It wasn’t said to go for labor? It wasn’t...

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:21.152
Solomon Horowitz: Nothing! The first transports it was said [are] for deportation.

00:06:21.152 --> 00:06:21.665
David Boder: Oh!

00:06:21.665 --> 00:06:26.751
Solomon Horowitz: For deportation. They were taken to Belzyce. There was a ‘Place of Repose’ [burial ground] of millions of people. Belzyce.

00:06:26.751 --> 00:06:27.186
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:27.870
Solomon Horowitz: There was a factory...

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:28.244
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:28.244 --> 00:06:31.109
Solomon Horowitz: . . . where people were destroyed electrically. These were the first three transports.

00:06:31.109 --> 00:06:32.526
David Boder: Wait a moment. What kind of factory?

00:06:32.526 --> 00:06:34.662
Solomon Horowitz: Bel-...in Belzyce. You don’t know? It was a milli...milli...

00:06:34.662 --> 00:06:36.556
David Boder: You mean Bels...Bergen-Belsen.

00:06:36.556 --> 00:06:38.098
Solomon Horowitz: No. Belzyce.

00:06:38.098 --> 00:06:38.736
David Boder: Belzyce.

00:06:38.736 --> 00:06:39.780
Solomon Horowitz: In the region of Lemberg.

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:40.278
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:40.278 --> 00:06:44.347
Solomon Horowitz: There was a factory into which he brought millions of people.

00:06:44.347 --> 00:06:45.079
David Boder: Hm.

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:53.892
Solomon Horowitz: And it was later that he made fats out of them. It has been confirmed. It was a gigantic...like Treblinka. You don’t know about Bel-...Belzyce? It is an atrocious thing. There were [people] brought from Poland and from Switzerland [?]. Millions of Jews were burned.

00:06:53.892 --> 00:06:56.218
David Boder: Belzyce is not the same as Treblinka? Belzyce is...

00:06:56.218 --> 00:06:58.949
Solomon Horowitz: It is not. Treblinka is different, a different hell, and this is a different hell.

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:01.259
David Boder: Nu, tell me, who has seen that? Who knows it? You say it was...

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:06.441
Solomon Horowitz: It is known. It is known exactly, because people jumped off the trains...

00:07:06.441 --> 00:07:07.096
David Boder: Nu?

00:07:07.096 --> 00:07:16.060
Solomon Horowitz: . . . during the journey to Belzyce. They were already undressed nude a few kilometers before Belzyce. And it is known exactly what was done there with the people. One knows exactly. But from Buczacz there were only three transports to Belzyce.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.012
David Boder: Nu?

00:07:17.012 --> 00:07:19.933
Solomon Horowitz: . . . because later on he begrudged the trains. He saw that people are jumping off.

00:07:19.933 --> 00:07:20.619
David Boder: Yes?

00:07:20.619 --> 00:07:27.018
Solomon Horowitz: So he didn’t come any more with transports. But he arrived. And he took out a few hundred Jewish workers. They should dig graves.

00:07:27.018 --> 00:07:27.704
David Boder: Hm.

00:07:27.704 --> 00:07:28.875
Solomon Horowitz: To be dug eight days before...

00:07:28.875 --> 00:07:29.422
David Boder: Yes?

00:07:29.422 --> 00:07:32.313
Solomon Horowitz: A grave was dug in Buczacz...there is...which is six kilometers...[Footnote: He is either utterly confused about the actual measurements, or a ditch was dug for another purpose, possibly for drainage, or just punitive work accompanied by intentional terror rumors. See note on page 56 2(2012).]

00:07:32.313 --> 00:07:33.069
David Boder: Hm.

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:34.022
Solomon Horowitz: . . . in...in length.

00:07:34.022 --> 00:07:34.677
David Boder: Hm.

00:07:34.677 --> 00:07:46.543
Solomon Horowitz: Such a grave was dug. And later on Jews were led out. He asked to be given Jews, a...a contingent of five hundred or a thousand people for slaughter. Naturally the Jewish council did not want to. They said, ‘Who should be handed over and who should remain?’ [You decide.]

00:07:46.543 --> 00:07:47.215
David Boder: Hm.

00:07:47.215 --> 00:07:49.683
Solomon Horowitz: So the people said [to the Germans], ‘Go and take yourself.’ So he went around himself, from house to house.

00:07:49.683 --> 00:07:50.589
David Boder: The German?

00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:52.089
Solomon Horowitz: The German. The Germans went around with militia.

00:07:52.089 --> 00:07:52.777
David Boder: Yes?

00:07:52.777 --> 00:07:59.448
Solomon Horowitz: And they took...from house to house people were taken out to be killed. Then we began digging bunkers underneath the floors...

00:07:59.448 --> 00:07:59.948
David Boder: Yes

00:07:59.948 --> 00:08:12.144
Solomon Horowitz: . . . in every house to hide ourselves. They entered a house. They went around like this and knocked and dug until they found. They took out from bunkers, I don’t know, Jews by the fifties or hundreds. Instead of the thousand burned offerings they had originally asked for, they gathered three thousand.

00:08:12.144 --> 00:08:12.769
David Boder: Hm.

00:08:12.769 --> 00:08:20.966
Solomon Horowitz: They were led out, and Jews themselves had to bury them. All were shot. They left only twenty, thirty Jews, and said these twenty, thirty Jews should bury the dead.

00:08:20.966 --> 00:08:22.434
David Boder: Did you see that yourself?

00:08:22.434 --> 00:08:42.153
Solomon Horowitz: Yes! Later on these twenty, thirty were alas, shot. What does ‘saw’ mean? I put up a gravestone on that large and holy place, on that large mass...mass grave. I have just put up a gravestone. There lie all my relatives, all my brothers and sister everybody. Six...six...six thousand Jews lie there in one grave. What does ‘saw’ mean? It is a fact! Some question! Thus was done very time. It was done. These were called ‘actions’ It was called...

00:08:42.153 --> 00:08:42.622
David Boder: Yes?

00:08:42.622 --> 00:08:45.387
Solomon Horowitz: . . . an action takes place.

00:08:45.387 --> 00:08:46.355
David Boder: Hm.

00:08:46.355 --> 00:08:49.911
Solomon Horowitz: Every three, four weeks an ‘action’ was made until in Buczacz only two thousand Jews remained, the last two thousand Jews.

00:08:49.911 --> 00:08:51.645
David Boder: And where were you during all this time?

00:08:51.645 --> 00:08:57.195
Solomon Horowitz: In all I went through thirteen ‘actions’ and remained alive. Thirteen ‘actions’ I have gone through under the ground in my...my house.

00:08:57.195 --> 00:09:00.479
David Boder: Oh. Under the ground in your house! You were hiding?

00:09:00.479 --> 00:09:02.313
Solomon Horowitz: Not hiding! Everybody was hiding. As soon as...

00:09:02.313 --> 00:09:02.719
David Boder: Oh!

00:09:02.719 --> 00:09:07.453
Solomon Horowitz: . . . the Germans raided as an ‘action’ every...everybody would hide in any kind of hiding place he had.

00:09:07.453 --> 00:09:07.921
David Boder: Yes?

00:09:07.921 --> 00:09:16.583
Solomon Horowitz: But people were found. Whoever succeeded, succeeded. Those who weren’t discovered weren’t discovered. I had gone through thirteen ‘actions’ in Buczacz. And I lost the family in the eleventh ‘action.’

00:09:16.583 --> 00:09:18.910
David Boder: Where was...where had the family been?

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:19.909
Solomon Horowitz: The family was together with me.

00:09:19.909 --> 00:09:20.408
David Boder: Nu?

00:09:20.408 --> 00:09:22.173
Solomon Horowitz: We were in a pit. Eighty person...were we...

00:09:22.173 --> 00:09:24.156
David Boder: Such large did you make?

00:09:24.156 --> 00:09:29.622
Solomon Horowitz: Eighty persons. We made a gigantic underground cellar. And I let in...everybody let in only twenty, thirty.

00:09:29.622 --> 00:09:32.371
David Boder: Under whose house was it? Your house?

00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:33.043
Solomon Horowitz: Under...under....Yes.

00:09:33.043 --> 00:09:33.622
David Boder: Your house.

00:09:33.622 --> 00:09:35.888
Solomon Horowitz: No, not my own. There where I was living.

00:09:35.888 --> 00:09:36.700
David Boder: Oh.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.621
Solomon Horowitz: The Jewish council gave me to live in.

00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:40.387
David Boder: Hm.

00:09:40.387 --> 00:09:48.652
Solomon Horowitz: And there, under the ground, we dug out a cel-...cellar, dug out with three walls [partitions?] extremely well camouflaged. And there I took in eighty people, because I saw everybody only kept in a bunker twenty, thirty, but I saw there were people shelterless, who didn’t have any bunker.

00:09:48.652 --> 00:09:49.308
David Boder: Hm.

00:09:49.308 --> 00:09:52.070
Solomon Horowitz: So I told them they should come to me and hide. This perhaps brought about the...the tragedy.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:52.821
David Boder: Yes?

00:09:52.821 --> 00:10:00.939
Solomon Horowitz: Because of that it was discovered. There was...I can describe to you the night of the catastrophe. During eleven...eleven ‘actions’ my bunker was...was saved, was not discovered.

00:10:00.939 --> 00:10:01.627
David Boder: Yes?

00:10:01.627 --> 00:10:15.999
Solomon Horowitz: During the eleventh ‘action’ we had already been ‘bunkered.’ We heard that the Gestapo had arrived, out for an ‘action.’ We had ‘bunkered’ ourselves around twelve o’clock at night. Around two o’clock at night I heard voices from the outside in these words, that is, in substance, ‘We are six persons, a Hungarian family.’ [He quotes in a slow, solemn voice./

00:10:15.999 --> 00:10:16.608
David Boder: Hm.

00:10:16.608 --> 00:10:17.928
Solomon Horowitz: ‘We are standing outside.’

00:10:17.928 --> 00:10:18.428
David Boder: Hm.

00:10:18.428 --> 00:10:21.652
Solomon Horowitz: ‘The murderers are not yet on this street. Have compassion, Jews, and let us in...’

00:10:21.652 --> 00:10:22.261
David Boder: Hm.

00:10:22.261 --> 00:10:47.610
Solomon Horowitz: ‘...because we are standing unprotected, in danger of being killed. The murderers are not yet in this street. Maybe we can still be saved!’ I heard that lying in the bunker. I tore open the cover of the bunker. I said to myself, ‘I don’t want to save myself, to save myself and have on my conscience six...six burned offerings, Hungarian Jews.’ I unscrewed [the cover of] the bunker and ran out to the gate of the house and took in that family. And then, at the moment when I took them in, a few of the Gestapo already on the street sensed that something is going on in this house.

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.834
David Boder: That family really was a real Jewish family?

00:10:50.834 --> 00:10:51.943
Solomon Horowitz: Yes. I took them in.

00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:53.270
David Boder: It was not a made up thing?

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.958
Solomon Horowitz: No. I took them in, that family...

00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:55.567
David Boder: Hm.

00:10:55.567 --> 00:10:57.332
Solomon Horowitz: . . . to us, and they were indeed with us.

00:10:57.332 --> 00:10:57.863
David Boder: Hm.

00:10:57.863 --> 00:10:59.365
Solomon Horowitz: And two hours later they overran the house...

00:10:59.365 --> 00:10:59.849
David Boder: Yes?

00:10:59.849 --> 00:11:03.133
Solomon Horowitz: . . . because they had sensed something, as if near this house there is some sort of scent.

00:11:03.133 --> 00:11:03.523
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:03.523 --> 00:11:03.523
Solomon Horowitz: They stopped at the house and were shooting from all sides, and eventually the bunker was discovered.

00:11:03.523 --> 00:11:09.376
David Boder: Hm.

00:11:09.376 --> 00:11:21.180
Solomon Horowitz: Then my whole family was also gathered together with the eighty persons. Everybody was led out and shot, and I with my only son that I possess, fifteen years old, in the last moment between the baggage — there was a lot of baggage among eighty persons, featherbeds and sacks...

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:21.820
David Boder: Yes?

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.335
Solomon Horowitz: So I lay down among these sacks and featherbeds on the ground.

00:11:24.335 --> 00:11:24.960
David Boder: Yes?

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.085
Solomon Horowitz: Thus, because of the great noise and the tumult and the screams...

00:11:27.085 --> 00:11:27.647
David Boder: Hm.

00:11:27.647 --> 00:11:32.724
Solomon Horowitz: . . . these two people, my child and I, they left behind. I was lying among the baggage. I was trod on with the feet.

00:11:32.724 --> 00:11:33.255
David Boder: Hm.

00:11:33.255 --> 00:11:33.879
Solomon Horowitz: And I wasn’t noticed.

00:11:33.879 --> 00:11:34.316
David Boder: Hm.

00:11:34.316 --> 00:11:37.147
Solomon Horowitz: I gave my whole family the advice. They scattered in small groups.

00:11:37.147 --> 00:11:37.772
David Boder: Yes?

00:11:37.772 --> 00:11:40.116
Solomon Horowitz: Unfortunately, they were seen. They were all picked up and led away.

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:40.632
David Boder: Hm.

00:11:40.632 --> 00:11:41.632
Solomon Horowitz: I had eleven persons in my family.

00:11:41.632 --> 00:11:42.132
David Boder: Hm.

00:11:42.132 --> 00:11:43.757
Solomon Horowitz: And I with my only boy remained in the cellar.

00:11:43.757 --> 00:11:44.976
David Boder: How old was your boy?

00:11:44.976 --> 00:11:46.413
Solomon Horowitz: He is here. He is here. Fifteen years.

00:11:46.413 --> 00:11:49.468
David Boder: Hm. And the...the others from your family were your wife...

00:11:49.468 --> 00:11:53.107
Solomon Horowitz: A wife with five sisters...

00:11:53.107 --> 00:11:53.653
David Boder: Hm.

00:11:53.653 --> 00:11:54.496
Solomon Horowitz: . . . with a child,...

00:11:54.496 --> 00:11:55.168
David Boder: Hm.

00:11:55.168 --> 00:11:56.790
Solomon Horowitz: . . . with a father, may his memory be blessed...

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.164
David Boder: Oh! You had only one child?

00:11:58.164 --> 00:12:00.460
Solomon Horowitz: I had this child and the other child, two children.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:00.928
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:00.928 --> 00:12:01.756
Solomon Horowitz: This child remained [with] me, the older one...

00:12:01.756 --> 00:12:02.256
David Boder: Yes?

00:12:02.256 --> 00:12:03.318
Solomon Horowitz: . . . and a boy of nine years...

00:12:03.318 --> 00:12:04.021
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:04.021 --> 00:12:07.171
Solomon Horowitz: . . . who sho-...sho-...showed abilities of becoming one of the world’s great...he was...

00:12:07.171 --> 00:12:07.905
David Boder: A what?

00:12:07.905 --> 00:12:10.745
Solomon Horowitz: He showed me abilities of becoming one of the world’s great...he was...

00:12:10.745 --> 00:12:11.920
David Boder: A what?

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:15.519
Solomon Horowitz: He showed abilities of becoming one of the world’s great...

00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:16.459
David Boder: In what...eh...

00:12:16.459 --> 00:12:19.769
Solomon Horowitz: In what field? In the field of memory [word not clear]. He had a terrific memory, and simply in...in intelligence. By himself he had already memorized a terrific amount of biblical knowledge.

00:12:19.769 --> 00:12:20.519
David Boder: Hm.

00:12:20.519 --> 00:12:21.672
Solomon Horowitz: He remembered half of the Book of Psalms by heart.

00:12:21.672 --> 00:12:22.297
David Boder: Hm.

00:12:22.297 --> 00:12:31.835
Solomon Horowitz: When he went to the...the slaughter, to be slaughtered, he was saying the Psalms from memory. And he said two thousand Jews were being led. He said, ‘I am still going to pray to God. Maybe in the last moment we will be saved.’ An unusual, and extraordinarily gifted child of nine years. They have murd-...[interrupted]

00:12:31.835 --> 00:12:35.124
David Boder: How did you find out about that? Who told you that?

00:12:35.124 --> 00:12:41.936
Solomon Horowitz: One was saved. From that transport one had escaped during...because when the transports were being taken some would run away. They would shoot after [them].

00:12:41.936 --> 00:12:42.657
David Boder: Hm.

00:12:42.657 --> 00:12:46.666
Solomon Horowitz: One out of thousands might be saved, because there were so many militia men. They guarded strongly.

00:12:46.666 --> 00:12:47.293
David Boder: Hm.

00:12:47.293 --> 00:13:05.199
Solomon Horowitz: But one was saved, and he told me how...he pictured to me enough how they were killed. My...my entire family I lost then. After that, when I saw that there remained in Buczacz the last two thousand Jews — I already had lost my family — I talked it over. I said, ‘It is getting to be Jew-clean. Let us escape to the forests. In town there is no more place for us. Let us run to the forests!’

00:13:05.199 --> 00:13:05.792
David Boder: Hm.

00:13:05.792 --> 00:13:11.493
Solomon Horowitz: I gathered three hundred and fifty Jews and brought them out into the forests. There...

00:13:11.493 --> 00:13:16.091
David Boder: Tell me, how...what does it mean, you ‘gathered them’? You told them they should come, or what?

00:13:16.091 --> 00:13:19.423
Solomon Horowitz: I told them that they should come in groups to such and such woods.

00:13:19.423 --> 00:13:19.498
David Boder: Hm.

00:13:19.498 --> 00:13:20.614
Solomon Horowitz: In such and such direction.

00:13:20.614 --> 00:13:20.931
David Boder: Yes?

00:13:20.931 --> 00:13:28.635
Solomon Horowitz: And there I will be found, and another group of Jews. And there we will plan how we will support ourselves and which peasant we could trust to bring food.

00:13:28.635 --> 00:13:28.921
David Boder: Hm.

00:13:28.921 --> 00:13:31.424
Solomon Horowitz: There we will plan how to hide under ground.

00:13:31.424 --> 00:13:31.680
David Boder: Hm.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:36.957
Solomon Horowitz: And we shall talk it over. Maybe, maybe there in the woods, we will live through Hitlerism. [Pause.]

00:13:36.957 --> 00:13:41.042
David Boder: And so afterwards?

00:13:41.042 --> 00:13:55.575
Solomon Horowitz: [Pause.] Afterwards [pauses again] we were...A month later while in the woods, we were reported to the Gestapo, that there are Jews in the woods.

00:13:55.575 --> 00:14:06.122
David Boder: Hm. Can you describe what people did all day in the forest? Where did one sleep? Where did one...Describe the life in the forest...in the forest.

00:14:06.122 --> 00:14:47.187
Solomon Horowitz: The life in the forest was a constant terror. One was afraid during every second that there may come a group of Gentiles and kill us all. People looked only for thicker trees to hide. All day long people thought only about one thing, to save one’s life. Days passed when people forgot even about the need to eat. There passed entire days in which one neither ate nor slept. And when one became tired, one lay down on the grass. Once it rained constantly for three days. And it became so muddy that afterwards, when we got up, people got lost. We couldn’t find one another. Thus we were submerged, covered with mud. That is how we slept in a forest. And at the beginning the food consisted of mushrooms from the trees, around the trees, on the ground. There are such dark mushrooms.

00:14:47.187 --> 00:14:48.001
David Boder: What is that? [Did not understand the Polish word grzyby.]

00:14:48.001 --> 00:14:52.283
Solomon Horowitz: Dark mushroom. It is such a...[with distaste] it is a disgusting food.

00:14:52.283 --> 00:14:55.102
David Boder: The bark, the...the bark? Kora? What...

00:14:55.102 --> 00:14:56.308
Solomon Horowitz: Yes. Like bark. Black bark.

00:14:56.308 --> 00:14:57.213
David Boder: Yes, yes.

00:14:57.213 --> 00:15:00.876
Solomon Horowitz: This we ate. One peeled it and boiled it in water.

00:15:00.876 --> 00:15:01.419
David Boder: Hm.

00:15:01.419 --> 00:15:03.349
Solomon Horowitz: And one ate it, and the water in which it was boiled we drank.

00:15:03.349 --> 00:15:04.962
David Boder: [Clarifying the word] Cooked?

00:15:04.962 --> 00:15:09.183
Solomon Horowitz: Cooked. Cooked. One took water, [word not clear] water. One boiled it thoroughly, and this one ate.

00:15:09.183 --> 00:15:12.470
David Boder: Nu, were there only men, or were there...

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:25.661
Solomon Horowitz: Oh, women also. Women and children. Among the three hundred and fifty there were engineers and doctors and rabbis, all sorts of people. An assemblage of various sorts of people. And the engineers began planning how to make underground bunkers.

00:15:25.661 --> 00:15:26.400
David Boder: Hm.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:37.028
Solomon Horowitz: And we made in the area of five kilometers...there were made forty bunkers. An area of forty bunkers. In each bunker there were a few people, in fives, in sixes, in tens.

00:15:37.028 --> 00:15:37.812
David Boder: Hm.

00:15:37.812 --> 00:15:54.561
Solomon Horowitz: And it was thus. In the daytime we lay the whole under...underground. And we were afr-...afraid that should a peasant get lost there, a Gentile with a cow, it will soon be known that there are Jews in the forest. So we lay all day long underground. In the evening, at night, we permitted ourselves to go out...

00:15:54.561 --> 00:15:55.103
David Boder: Hm.

00:15:55.103 --> 00:16:08.239
Solomon Horowitz: outside to take a bit of fresh air, because at night we weren’t afraid of a raid. It was a forest dense with trees. So at night we used to come together from all the bunkers to one place, to one assembly point...

00:16:08.239 --> 00:16:08.827
David Boder: Hm.

00:16:08.827 --> 00:16:19.455
Solomon Horowitz: . . . around me. And we used to make campfire, a fire around us. We baked potatoes and sat and talked about what will become of us. While we were in the forest, Russian partisans arrived. That was very interesting. Parachutes descended. Thirty partisans...

00:16:19.455 --> 00:16:20.164
David Boder: Parachutes?

00:16:20.164 --> 00:16:20.661
Solomon Horowitz: Parachutes.

00:16:20.661 --> 00:16:21.777
David Boder: Into the forest? Or was it...

00:16:21.777 --> 00:16:25.694
Solomon Horowitz: No. They descended in an open place. They ran. They were...they knew that the Germans are there. They were Russians.

00:16:25.694 --> 00:16:25.905
David Boder: Hm.

00:16:25.905 --> 00:00:00.000
Solomon Horowitz: So they ran into the forest hide.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:16:27.955
David Boder: Yes.

00:16:27.955 --> 00:16:29.556
Solomon Horowitz: They had descended on an open place, on...on a landing place.

00:16:29.556 --> 00:16:29.993
David Boder: Yes.

00:16:29.993 --> 00:16:37.121
Solomon Horowitz: There is where they had descended. And they came to us, into the forest, thirty persons, Russians. And they were hiding with us for six weeks.

00:16:37.121 --> 00:16:38.463
David Boder: Hm.

00:16:38.463 --> 00:16:59.041
Solomon Horowitz: And so we had partisans. They were armed. Our spirit rose. Now we already have a little...a bit of arms. If an attack comes we had something with which to defend ourselves. These partisans...during their stay we lived well because they would raid. At night they would go into the villages and attack the peasants and burn the crops. They would spread damage. They would, in the meantime, bring provisions from the peasants.

00:16:59.041 --> 00:17:01.136
David Boder: What would they burn? What did they use to burn?

00:17:01.136 --> 00:00:00.000
Solomon Horowitz: To burn grains.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:17:02.282
David Boder: What is it? [The word was not understood.]

00:17:02.282 --> 00:17:04.604
Solomon Horowitz: They used to burn grain, rye, wheat.

00:17:04.604 --> 00:17:04.860
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:05.403
Solomon Horowitz: Wheat, the field.

00:17:05.403 --> 00:17:05.539
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:05.539 --> 00:17:06.308
Solomon Horowitz: They wanted to do damage.

00:17:06.308 --> 00:17:07.197
David Boder: Oh! That was sabotage.

00:17:07.197 --> 00:17:11.388
Solomon Horowitz: Yes. Sabotage. They descended in the...the time of the harvest.

00:17:11.388 --> 00:17:11.569
David Boder: Hm.

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:12.956
Solomon Horowitz: They descended when the crops were harvested.

00:17:12.956 --> 00:17:13.288
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:13.288 --> 00:17:15.534
Solomon Horowitz: To spread sabotage, to cause great damages [?].

00:17:15.534 --> 00:17:15.806
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:15.806 --> 00:17:21.067
Solomon Horowitz: At that time they burned, and in the meantime from...from the peasants they took food and brought it to the woods.

00:17:21.067 --> 00:17:21.309
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:21.309 --> 00:17:25.937
Solomon Horowitz: Then on one occasion they brought a radio to the forest. They had taken away from a Ukrainian a rad-...

00:17:25.937 --> 00:17:26.329
David Boder: A radio?

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:26.540
Solomon Horowitz: A radio.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.771
David Boder: For receiving or sending?

00:17:28.771 --> 00:17:31.033
Solomon Horowitz: No. They brought a radio to us to the forest.

00:17:31.033 --> 00:17:31.742
David Boder: An ordinary radio.

00:17:31.742 --> 00:17:37.787
Solomon Horowitz: Yes. An ordinary radio, and we...that radio...an engineer took that radio and ‘bunkered’ it. It was tied with wires to a tree.

00:17:37.787 --> 00:17:38.119
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:38.119 --> 00:17:52.697
Solomon Horowitz: And it was powered with fifteen batteries. We had it every night. Fifteen batteries were bought. People were sent. They risked their lives. They were disguised as Gentiles into the towns to buy batteries, so that we should every night, every evening get some news of what is going on in the world.

00:17:52.697 --> 00:17:56.813
David Boder: Hm. Was it possible to buy the small...what were the...what kind of batteries were they?

00:17:56.813 --> 00:18:01.592
Solomon Horowitz: Batteries. Such simple...simple batteries. Simple, and with that the engineer powered the radio.

00:18:01.592 --> 00:18:01.758
David Boder: Hm.

00:18:01.758 --> 00:18:04.728
Solomon Horowitz: With the batteries every night we listened to the news.

00:18:04.728 --> 00:18:05.135
David Boder: Hm.

00:18:05.135 --> 00:18:19.517
Solomon Horowitz: We got together. It was near me. Gathered together all the three hundred and fifty Jews, sitting up at night. We turned on the radio. The radio began to inform us when the first advance against Kharkov, when they made the Germans pull back from Kharkov.

00:18:19.517 --> 00:18:20.979
David Boder: Oh. When they chased away the Germans?

00:18:20.979 --> 00:18:22.125
Solomon Horowitz: Chased away, yes.

00:18:22.125 --> 00:18:22.276
David Boder: Yes?

00:18:22.276 --> 00:18:24.914
Solomon Horowitz: We heard over the radio about how Kharkov was taken....

00:18:24.914 --> 00:18:25.457
David Boder: Hm.

00:18:25.457 --> 00:18:27.070
Solomon Horowitz: . . . all the points along the Dnieper.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:27.372
David Boder: Hm.

00:18:27.372 --> 00:18:34.563
Solomon Horowitz: We heard over the radio about all the occupations [of cities]. They were advancing with the swiftness, right up to the suburb of Kiev. The radio had led us...

00:18:34.563 --> 00:18:34.759
David Boder: Hm.

00:18:34.759 --> 00:18:38.965
Solomon Horowitz: We heard that the Soviets were already patrolling the suburbs of Kiev.

00:18:38.965 --> 00:18:39.387
David Boder: Hm.

00:18:39.387 --> 00:18:49.940
Solomon Horowitz: And then, at that time, it already brought us a bit...a bit of hope that they will approach closer. I used to sit all day long, writing with pencil on...on the plan, with a map...

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:50.226
David Boder: Yes?

00:18:50.226 --> 00:18:56.046
Solomon Horowitz: . . . to try and figure out how many kilometers they cover in a day, how long it has to take till they come to us.

00:18:56.046 --> 00:18:57.961
David Boder: And how far were you from Kiev?

00:18:57.961 --> 00:19:01.293
Solomon Horowitz: From Kiev? We were still far from Kiev, over a thousand kilometers.

00:19:01.293 --> 00:19:02.002
David Boder: Oh! Oh!

00:19:02.002 --> 00:19:10.761
Solomon Horowitz: [Chuckles.] We were still far enough, far enough. But still we already had a bit of hope. Maybe we will still survive. Maybe we will. And then, as soon as...Then came the catastrophe, the forest was attacked.

00:19:10.761 --> 00:19:12.133
David Boder: Who attacked?

00:19:12.133 --> 00:19:19.987
Solomon Horowitz: The Germans, the Germans. It has been reported thus. This tale was carried to the Gestapo, that thousands of Jews are located in the woods, with ammunition...

00:19:19.987 --> 00:19:20.741
David Boder: Hm.

00:19:20.741 --> 00:19:22.852
Solomon Horowitz: . . . with a secret radio, and with partisans.

00:19:22.852 --> 00:19:23.349
David Boder: Hm.

00:19:23.349 --> 00:19:31.159
Solomon Horowitz: Imagine what was sent out against us. Whole divisions were sent to surround the woods, and there began a gigantic raid on the forest.

00:19:31.159 --> 00:19:31.325
David Boder: Yes?

00:19:31.325 --> 00:00:00.000
Solomon Horowitz: They began to search. A raid.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:19:33.330
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:33.330 --> 00:20:00.664
Solomon Horowitz: The moment the partisans sensed that the woods are being raided, they were recalled. They left us. The radio remained, and they created only a little Jewish partisan group. They organized fifteen young men, Jews. They gave them arms with which to defend themselves. And so we already had a little Jewish partisan group. They left, and the Jewish partisan group got ready to protect us at least against...against common bandits who went around robbing. When they had left and we remained in the woods, they were raiding the woods constantly. They had found already the radio.

00:20:00.664 --> 00:20:01.403
David Boder: Hm.

00:20:01.403 --> 00:20:11.609
Solomon Horowitz: They found the radio. And Jews were being killed. And some bunkers remained. The result was that out of the three hundred and fifty Jews, no more than fifteen remained.

00:20:11.609 --> 00:20:12.212
David Boder: Fifteen?

00:20:12.212 --> 00:20:20.081
Solomon Horowitz: Fifteen. Then it happened. During the whole summer...summer time we were able to hide in the forest, because the leaves were strewn over the bunkers.

00:20:20.081 --> 00:20:20.443
David Boder: Hm.

00:20:20.443 --> 00:20:25.413
Solomon Horowitz: The moment the snow fell, since we had to go out on the snow occasionally, we left a trail.

00:20:25.413 --> 00:20:25.910
David Boder: Oh!

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:26.604
Solomon Horowitz: Footprints.

00:20:26.604 --> 00:20:27.252
David Boder: Yes?

00:20:27.252 --> 00:20:31.986
Solomon Horowitz: When they attacked the forest in snow time, they saw by the...by the footprints. They tracked them down to each...

00:20:31.986 --> 00:20:32.423
David Boder: Hm.

00:20:32.423 --> 00:20:39.328
Solomon Horowitz: . . . bunker. And then began the tragedy in the forest. The few Jews came to be annihilated, the few remaining in the forest.

00:20:39.328 --> 00:20:39.705
David Boder: Hm.

00:20:39.705 --> 00:20:43.790
Solomon Horowitz: And out of the three hundred and fifty there remained no more than fifteen remained.

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:44.604
David Boder: Fifteen?

00:20:44.604 --> 00:20:45.087
Solomon Horowitz: Fifteen.

00:20:45.087 --> 00:20:49.414
David Boder: Hm. Might not some have run away to other places?

00:20:49.414 --> 00:20:57.208
Solomon Horowitz: No. We were constantly on the run. It was like this. When, for instance, this part of the forest was raided...we were in seventeen bunkers...

00:20:57.208 --> 00:20:57.525
David Boder: Hm.

00:20:57.525 --> 00:21:00.766
Solomon Horowitz: Each time we had to run away to another forest. As soon...as soon as we were discovered in this little piece of forest...

00:21:00.766 --> 00:21:01.038
David Boder: Hm.

00:21:01.038 --> 00:21:03.405
Solomon Horowitz: . . . we had to leave it and escape to another forest.

00:21:03.405 --> 00:21:05.259
David Boder: And each time you had to build new bunkers.

00:21:05.259 --> 00:21:09.450
Solomon Horowitz: Build new bunkers. And how these bunkers were built! This is extraordinarily interesting to describe [?].

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:09.661
David Boder: Hm.

00:21:09.661 --> 00:21:13.279
Solomon Horowitz: How was one able to build a bunker in the forest? One had to cut down trees.

00:21:13.279 --> 00:21:13.792
David Boder: Hm.

00:21:13.792 --> 00:21:16.099
Solomon Horowitz: The dug up earth had to be carried away.

00:21:16.099 --> 00:21:16.506
David Boder: Hm.

00:21:16.506 --> 00:21:18.134
Solomon Horowitz: And it [the structure] had to be propped up underground.

00:21:18.134 --> 00:21:18.466
David Boder: Hm.

00:21:18.466 --> 00:21:28.431
Solomon Horowitz: And this was made, for instance, in that...in that part where we were. If we wanted to build the bunker, trees had to be cut in an entirely other part, because if somebody should come, he shouldn’t be able to notice that trees had been cut here. You understand?

00:21:28.431 --> 00:21:28.898
David Boder: Oh! Oh!

00:21:28.898 --> 00:21:29.592
Solomon Horowitz: You understand?

00:21:29.592 --> 00:21:32.713
David Boder: You needed tree...trees for the bunkers.

00:21:32.713 --> 00:21:33.120
Solomon Horowitz: For the bunkers.

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.562
David Boder: What for did you need trees for bunkers?

00:21:35.562 --> 00:21:38.788
Solomon Horowitz: Materials, to prop up. If one digs a hole [a cave] it will cave in. It has to be propped up.

00:21:38.788 --> 00:21:39.271
David Boder: Hm.

00:21:39.271 --> 00:21:40.100
Solomon Horowitz: It has to be propped up.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:40.462
David Boder: Hm! Yes.

00:21:40.462 --> 00:21:41.080
Solomon Horowitz: With material.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:41.743
David Boder: Yes?

00:21:41.743 --> 00:21:48.648
Solomon Horowitz: Nu, and if we should up...up...uproot the trees here, cut here in the part where we are, if one should come to the forest it will be seen that there are trees missing here.

00:21:48.648 --> 00:21:48.904
David Boder: Yes?

00:21:48.904 --> 00:21:50.412
Solomon Horowitz: So it will be understood that someone is hidden here.

00:21:50.412 --> 00:21:50.668
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:50.668 --> 00:21:52.960
Solomon Horowitz: [so] we had to go two, three kilometers, some place else.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:53.397
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:53.397 --> 00:21:58.493
Solomon Horowitz: To another part of the forest, cut the trees there, carry them on the shoulders to this...to this part.

00:21:58.493 --> 00:21:58.930
David Boder: Hm.

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:03.724
Solomon Horowitz: And later on when the ground was dug up, the earth, too, had to be carried away a few kilometers. It should not be noticed...

00:22:03.724 --> 00:22:04.146
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:04.146 --> 00:22:11.714
Solomon Horowitz: . . . that the earth had been dug up here. That is how bunker was made! And the engineers made a bunker of...of...of five stories. It is interesting.

00:22:11.714 --> 00:22:12.347
David Boder: Deep?

00:22:12.347 --> 00:22:19.236
Solomon Horowitz: Deep, underground. And twigs were...were kind of braided. And so we slept, one on top of the other, like on plank beds, as it was called.

00:22:19.236 --> 00:22:20.231
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:20.231 --> 00:22:22.071
Solomon Horowitz: And when the Germans found that bunker!

00:22:22.071 --> 00:22:24.136
David Boder: You mean five levels of beds were made?

00:22:24.136 --> 00:22:25.553
Solomon Horowitz: Beds, underground.

00:22:25.553 --> 00:22:25.885
David Boder: Yes?

00:22:25.885 --> 00:22:31.584
Solomon Horowitz: And when that bunker was discovered, they brought down a photographer to photograph it.

00:22:31.584 --> 00:22:32.202
David Boder: Yes?

00:22:32.202 --> 00:22:37.418
Solomon Horowitz: And they said, ‘Look what the Jews can do! A subterranean little Paris.’ I heard the voices...

00:22:37.418 --> 00:22:38.142
David Boder: Subterranean what?

00:22:38.142 --> 00:22:39.634
Solomon Horowitz: Subterranean little Paris.

00:22:39.634 --> 00:22:40.840
David Boder: The Germans said that?

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:46.871
Solomon Horowitz: The Germans said [that]. When...when they discovered the bunker with Jews in it, they took...they brought a photographer to photograph it.

00:22:46.871 --> 00:22:47.218
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:47.218 --> 00:22:51.952
Solomon Horowitz: And they were astonished. They said, ‘Look what the Jews can do! A subterranean little Paris!’

00:22:51.952 --> 00:22:54.379
David Boder: Yes. What did they mean by a ‘little Paris’?

00:22:54.379 --> 00:22:55.857
Solomon Horowitz: Because it was so artistically...

00:22:55.857 --> 00:22:56.174
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:56.174 --> 00:22:57.576
Solomon Horowitz: . . . artistically constructed. It was such a masterpiece [Footnote: It is possible that the Germans referred to the famous subterranean structures in Old Paris.].

00:22:57.576 --> 00:22:57.787
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:57.787 --> 00:23:17.385
Solomon Horowitz: With so...with so much...with so much effort, with so much....And all that didn’t help. The end. The winter brought the catastrophe, and very few were left. We remained fifteen persons only, not in the forest either. If we would have been in the forest these few wouldn’t have remained either. We [then] escaped into the villages and persuaded a Gentile [that] he should make a bunker, a hole in a stable.

00:23:17.385 --> 00:23:17.687
David Boder: Hm.

00:23:17.687 --> 00:23:21.923
Solomon Horowitz: We laid there, four persons, for four months in a stable underneath the cattle.

00:23:21.923 --> 00:23:23.642
David Boder: Who was with you? Your boy?

00:23:23.642 --> 00:23:28.451
Solomon Horowitz: The boy and two other persons who...they had more money to give to that Gentile for my share.

00:23:28.451 --> 00:23:29.084
David Boder: Hm.

00:23:29.084 --> 00:23:35.808
Solomon Horowitz: The Gentile took exorbitant sums for every day, and I didn’t have it. So I led two more people to that Gentile, and they paid for me.

00:23:35.808 --> 00:23:36.004
David Boder: Hm.

00:23:36.004 --> 00:23:40.029
Solomon Horowitz: We were four persons in a stable where the animals stood on top.

00:23:40.029 --> 00:23:40.240
David Boder: Hm.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:44.371
Solomon Horowitz: And underneath, under the manure, I was lying in a hole for four months.

00:23:44.371 --> 00:23:45.472
David Boder: Nu?

00:23:45.472 --> 00:23:55.527
Solomon Horowitz: There we lay for four months until the Soviets entered. Before Pesach in the year ’44 the Soviets arrived in our parts.

00:23:55.527 --> 00:23:56.070
David Boder: Yes?

00:23:56.070 --> 00:24:01.181
Solomon Horowitz: So when we heard that the Soviets are here we left the bunkers.

00:24:01.181 --> 00:24:01.648
David Boder: Nu?

00:24:01.648 --> 00:24:03.789
Solomon Horowitz: And we drove into the town.

00:24:03.789 --> 00:24:06.080
David Boder: What does it mean, ‘drove into the town’?

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.256
Solomon Horowitz: We went [walked] into the town.

00:24:07.256 --> 00:24:08.251
David Boder: Hm.

00:24:08.251 --> 00:24:13.407
Solomon Horowitz: And then eight days later the Soviets executed a retreat again.

00:24:13.407 --> 00:24:14.131
David Boder: A retreat?

00:24:14.131 --> 00:24:15.473
Solomon Horowitz: A retreat.

00:24:15.473 --> 00:24:15.759
David Boder: Nu?

00:24:15.759 --> 00:24:21.790
Solomon Horowitz: They executed a retreat, and we remained. When...when we left for the woods, I took a count of those who came back...

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:22.107
David Boder: Oh!

00:24:22.107 --> 00:24:23.660
Solomon Horowitz: . . . and I had forty-nine people.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.213
David Boder: From your two hundred and fifty.

00:24:25.213 --> 00:24:30.128
Solomon Horowitz: Yes, from my three hundred and fifty only fifteen were left, but in other forests, where I didn’t know, there were also hidden a few groups.

00:24:30.128 --> 00:24:30.278
David Boder: Nu?

00:24:30.278 --> 00:24:33.399
Solomon Horowitz: And these came together in my own town. Forty-nine people.

00:24:33.399 --> 00:24:33.927
David Boder: People. Nu?

00:24:33.927 --> 00:24:44.284
Solomon Horowitz: I took count. I know I had forty-nine people. These were out of a region of hundreds of thousands of people. These few people remained. And when I saw that a retreat is in process, I knew that we are again in mortal danger.

00:24:44.284 --> 00:24:46.892
David Boder: Was this already in the Russian region that you...

00:24:46.892 --> 00:24:50.510
Solomon Horowitz: Yes. We were already....The Russians had already control, had occupied that region, our region.

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:50.902
David Boder: Aha.

00:24:50.902 --> 00:24:53.073
Solomon Horowitz: Yes, so I...They came out from the woods.

00:24:53.073 --> 00:24:53.450
David Boder: Yes?

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:56.028
Solomon Horowitz: I saw that we are forty-nine persons in our little town.

00:24:56.028 --> 00:24:56.405
David Boder: Nu?

00:24:56.405 --> 00:25:00.053
Solomon Horowitz: I gathered the forty-nine people and thought of starting anew a bit of life.

00:25:00.053 --> 00:25:00.385
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:00.385 --> 00:25:01.260
Solomon Horowitz: To begin to rebuild [?].

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:01.455
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:25:01.455 --> 00:00:00.000
Solomon Horowitz: In the meantime, in eight days, I perceived a...a tumult.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:25:04.848
David Boder: Hm.

00:25:04.848 --> 00:25:05.882
Solomon Horowitz: A retreat.

00:25:05.882 --> 00:25:06.515
David Boder: Hm.

00:25:06.515 --> 00:25:09.219
Solomon Horowitz: I got in touch with a Jewish captain of the Russian army...

00:25:09.219 --> 00:25:09.702
David Boder: Hm.

00:25:09.702 --> 00:25:19.124
Solomon Horowitz: . . . who had...I asked what is going on. He said, ‘There have broken through...we had besieged, surrounded a city with sixteen divisions of German forces...’

00:25:19.124 --> 00:25:19.395
David Boder: Yes?

00:25:19.395 --> 00:25:21.385
Solomon Horowitz: ‘...and our main army went on.’

00:25:21.385 --> 00:25:22.230
David Boder: Hm.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:27.069
Solomon Horowitz: And so as the main army went on, they have broken out and will gain control again of the entire region of Galicia.’

00:25:27.069 --> 00:25:27.702
David Boder: Oh.

00:25:27.702 --> 00:25:29.843
Solomon Horowitz: ‘You are again in danger. We are retreating.’

00:25:29.843 --> 00:25:30.506
David Boder: Hm.

00:25:30.506 --> 00:25:40.516
Solomon Horowitz: So I begged him, ‘Take back these forty-nine.’ I explained to him that, since out of the many thousands of Jews only forty-nine have remained, I plead with him to take us along with the army.

00:25:40.516 --> 00:25:40.969
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:40.969 --> 00:25:51.688
Solomon Horowitz: We should be with the army. He granted me this favor and took us along with the army. We ran with the army to the Dniester, twenty-two kilometers, at night. It was something terrible. We couldn’t escape [by] ourselves, so we ran with the army.

00:25:51.688 --> 00:25:53.753
David Boder: Didn’t they have any carts, automobiles? Any [word not clear]?

00:25:53.753 --> 00:26:16.925
Solomon Horowitz: There...there were, but there was chaos in the retreat. It was said...At the beginning he had promised us that he will put the women and children on the vehicles, but when the moment of the retreat came there was such a tumult that we couldn’t do it. Each...each soldier [?] packed his own...his own and ran. And we civilians had to walk. And we ran until the Dniester, and then we crossed over to Horodenka, and we went as far as Czernowitz.

00:26:16.925 --> 00:26:17.422
David Boder: Hm.

00:26:17.422 --> 00:26:22.578
Solomon Horowitz: As far as Czernowitz. In Czernowitz we saw already...At first we thought that we are surrounded, we are caught in Czernowitz. We...

00:26:22.578 --> 00:26:23.392
David Boder: By the Germans?

00:26:23.392 --> 00:26:30.478
Solomon Horowitz: Yes. We thought that we are again surrounded by the Germans. Arriving in Czernowitz, we saw that we are saved, we are in Soviet hands.

00:26:30.478 --> 00:26:31.217
David Boder: Hm.

00:26:31.217 --> 00:26:40.579
Solomon Horowitz: The Germans are already...they won’t come here any more. In Czernowitz I...I distributed the forty-nine people...distributed them there among the Jews. In Czernowitz we found twenty-three thousand Jews...

00:26:40.579 --> 00:26:41.197
David Boder: Oh!

00:26:41.197 --> 00:26:43.519
Solomon Horowitz: . . . who received us very nicely, very well.

00:26:43.519 --> 00:26:47.152
David Boder: The Germans...had the Germans ever been in Czernowitz?

00:26:47.152 --> 00:26:48.207
Solomon Horowitz: They had been.

00:26:48.207 --> 00:26:48.569
David Boder: Nu?

00:26:48.569 --> 00:26:50.499
Solomon Horowitz: And there they did not do what they have done in Galicia

00:26:50.499 --> 00:26:51.177
David Boder: Hm.

00:26:51.177 --> 00:26:56.695
Solomon Horowitz: There in Czernowitz had been eighty thousand Jews. They deported sixty, lead them away, but the twenty [thousand] that had remained, remained.

00:26:56.695 --> 00:26:56.921
David Boder: Hm.

00:26:56.921 --> 00:27:05.424
Solomon Horowitz: Nothing happened to them. I found about twenty-three thousand Jews in Czernowitz, and we got settled, these forty-nine people. And I gained Czernowitz Rabbinat.

00:27:05.424 --> 00:27:05.771
David Boder: Hm.

00:27:05.771 --> 00:27:07.414
Solomon Horowitz: And I was a year in Czernowitz.

00:27:07.414 --> 00:27:08.801
David Boder: Hm.

00:27:08.801 --> 00:27:09.826
Solomon Horowitz: Now.

00:27:09.826 --> 00:27:10.882
David Boder: Yes?

00:27:10.882 --> 00:27:15.359
Solomon Horowitz: In ’45 when there started the repa-...repatriation to Poland...

00:27:15.359 --> 00:27:15.721
David Boder: Yes?

00:27:15.721 --> 00:27:20.214
Solomon Horowitz: I as a Polish citizen. I had documents made out in Czernowitz and went to Poland.

00:27:20.214 --> 00:27:20.802
David Boder: Hm.

00:27:20.802 --> 00:27:23.712
Solomon Horowitz: I was in Warsaw for six months as Rabbi of Warsaw.

00:27:23.712 --> 00:27:24.059
David Boder: Hm.

00:27:24.059 --> 00:00:00.000
Solomon Horowitz: Rabbi of Warsaw.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:27:25.280
David Boder: Hm.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:30.828
Solomon Horowitz: In Warsaw I began organizing a Jewish life. It cost me a lot of effort.

00:27:30.828 --> 00:27:31.838
David Boder: It cost you what?

00:27:31.838 --> 00:27:32.381
Solomon Horowitz: Effort.

00:27:32.381 --> 00:27:32.698
David Boder: Effort.

00:27:32.698 --> 00:27:37.688
Solomon Horowitz: Much effort. I saw that I am again in great danger, that danger lurks at every pace and step.

00:27:37.688 --> 00:27:39.361
David Boder: What does it mean, ‘danger’?

00:27:39.361 --> 00:27:44.698
Solomon Horowitz: Danger means...in Warsaw a Jew couldn’t show up on the street. Should he be recognized that he is a Jew...

00:27:44.698 --> 00:27:46.175
David Boder: After the Poles had retaken Warsaw?

00:27:46.175 --> 00:27:46.567
Solomon Horowitz: After Poland...

00:27:46.567 --> 00:27:46.929
David Boder: After the liberation of Poland?

00:27:46.929 --> 00:27:48.678
Solomon Horowitz: After the liberation of Poland.

00:27:48.678 --> 00:27:49.899
David Boder: What are they...why are they...

00:27:49.899 --> 00:27:52.432
Solomon Horowitz: There are pogroms. Don’t you know that today there are in Poland...

00:27:52.432 --> 00:27:54.105
David Boder: Yes, I know [words not clear].

00:27:54.105 --> 00:28:53.000
Solomon Horowitz: I will tell you why. It is...it is really this way. There has remained the...the poison of Hitlerism. There it did more damage than any place else. There Hitlerism took such deep roots that Hitlerism exists there today like an epidemic. It is not possible to notice that anything has changed there, whether Hitlerism has fallen. It is not possible to observe in the Polish regions that anything had happened. It looks like Hitlerism. The...the extermination of Jews is still advocated, and they are doing....It is true, the government is still very well disposed. The government wants to control the situation. The government in Poland is very good, but they are unable to control this situation. I saw how in Warsaw with every step I take outside I am in danger. I caught slaps. I was beaten. And I had to walk. Every step I had to walk. I couldn’t ride on a streetcar. I had to shave. I shaved off the beard, concealed it with the kerchief. Thus I saw that it is impossible for me to carry out my Jewish life. I began to try, look for ways. I got out of Poland and came to France.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.623
David Boder: You got out with...from Poland with whom?

00:28:55.623 --> 00:28:59.633
Solomon Horowitz: With a transport with other Jews. Two hundred of the Agudah Israel.

00:28:59.633 --> 00:29:04.276
David Boder: Tell me something about the Agudah Israel. What kind of an organization is that?

00:29:04.276 --> 00:29:12.257
Solomon Horowitz: Agudah Israel is an organization which endeavors to mold life according to the letter of Torah.

00:29:12.257 --> 00:29:12.890
David Boder: Hm.

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:20.609
Solomon Horowitz: That means it endeavors that the whole everyday life, that all that a man has to deal with in life, should proceed in the spirit of the Torah.

00:29:20.609 --> 00:29:21.061
David Boder: Aha.

00:29:21.061 --> 00:29:24.890
Solomon Horowitz: It endeavors to bring in the Torah spirit into every problem of life.

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:25.674
David Boder: Aha.

00:29:25.674 --> 00:29:28.991
Solomon Horowitz: Now Agudah Israel is endeavoring to build the Land of Israel.

00:29:28.991 --> 00:29:29.549
David Boder: Hm.

00:29:29.549 --> 00:29:33.454
Solomon Horowitz: Because they see that there is no more a place for us in Europe. For those remaining people there is no place.

00:29:33.454 --> 00:29:38.293
David Boder: Were they al-...were they always Zionists, the Agudah Israel?

00:29:38.293 --> 00:30:07.941
Solomon Horowitz: They were once...they were for Zion, but not as actively as today. Once they believed that the important thing is to stand guard over the Torah. And it can even be in the Diaspora, but the important thing is to see that the Jewish...that the Jewish life be according to the Torah. But today, since they see that in Europe there is no place for a Jew, they endeavor to rebuild the Land of Israel in the spirit of Torah. This is Agudah Israel. Agudah Israel endeavors to create and build a Jewish Home in the Land of Israel, but only in the spirit of the Jewish Torah.

00:30:07.941 --> 00:30:08.318
David Boder: Nu?

00:30:08.318 --> 00:30:10.022
Solomon Horowitz: This is the Agudah Israel.

00:30:10.022 --> 00:30:17.394
David Boder: And so? How did the Agudah Israel gather the two hundred people, and how did you get in touch with them?

00:30:17.394 --> 00:30:35.500
Solomon Horowitz: Agudah Israel is like this. When there...when it came to be after the catastrophe, after the liberation of Poland, there got together five, six people, no more, who had remained Jewish religious comrades. They went out in the street and they searched, simply searched for children. In Christian homes many [Jewish]children were hidden.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:35.756
David Boder: Hm.

00:30:35.756 --> 00:30:56.048
Solomon Horowitz: And they took each child and clothed it and fed it. And they said, ‘You should know you don’t have your parents. You have no family. But you are a child of Jews, and you have to be a Jewish child. And you should believe in God.’ They began raising these children. Six, seven people had gathered gradually and assembled hundreds of children. They bought them back from Gentiles. A lot of money was paid.

00:30:56.048 --> 00:30:58.113
David Boder: Why did they have to be bought back?

00:30:58.113 --> 00:31:09.510
Solomon Horowitz: Bought back? Because the Gentile woman didn’t want to surrender them. The Gentile woman knew that it was a deal. If she has saved a Jewish child she demands money. People got in touch with the Joint, with the Americans and it was paid, up to thirty thousand for a child, and even up to fifty thousand.

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:10.686
David Boder: Thirty thousand Zlotys?

00:31:10.686 --> 00:31:12.616
Solomon Horowitz: Zlotys. And up to fifty thousand Zlotys.

00:31:12.616 --> 00:31:15.797
David Boder: How much was a Zloty worth against the dollar?

00:31:15.797 --> 00:00:00.000
Solomon Horowitz: Hm. Against the dollar perhaps...about thirty thousand Zlotys was about...I don’t know exactly, but anyway it is quite a sum, hundreds of dollars. One used to give for a child three, four hundred dollars.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:31:33.842
David Boder: And?

00:31:33.842 --> 00:31:41.122
Solomon Horowitz: That much was given for a child. And these children were bought back, and people began bringing them up in a Jewish was of life. And then a ‘Benoss’ was created, separately for woman.

00:31:41.122 --> 00:31:41.861
David Boder: What is a ‘Benoss’?

00:31:41.861 --> 00:31:43.565
Solomon Horowitz: ‘Benoss’ means separate quarters for woman.

00:31:43.565 --> 00:31:43.912
David Boder: Yes.

00:31:43.912 --> 00:00:00.000
Solomon Horowitz: Since they are to lead a life [in the spirit] of the Torah, there should be...there cannot be a mixing of men and women.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:31:48.088
David Boder: Hm.

00:31:48.088 --> 00:31:52.475
Solomon Horowitz: In one Kibbutz there was created a Kibbutz for men separate and a Kibbutz separately for women.

00:31:52.475 --> 00:31:52.972
David Boder: Hm.

00:31:52.972 --> 00:31:57.555
Solomon Horowitz: And then the older women instructed the younger women. And lectures were always given about the spirit of the Torah.

00:31:57.555 --> 00:31:57.797
David Boder: Hm.

00:31:57.797 --> 00:32:01.038
Solomon Horowitz: And nowadays there exist in Poland forty-odd Kibbutzim...

00:32:01.038 --> 00:32:01.159
David Boder: Hm.

00:32:01.159 --> 00:32:03.466
Solomon Horowitz: Created by Agudah and...

00:32:03.466 --> 00:32:08.094
David Boder: There are other Kibbutzim, too, which were not created by the Agudah?

00:32:08.094 --> 00:32:10.627
Solomon Horowitz: There are all kinds, Mizrachi Kibbutzim.

00:32:10.627 --> 00:32:10.853
David Boder: Yes.

00:32:10.853 --> 00:32:13.325
Solomon Horowitz: But I am talking about the Agudah.

00:32:13.325 --> 00:32:13.537
David Boder: Yes, yes.

00:32:13.537 --> 00:00:00.000
Solomon Horowitz: The program of the Agudah...there is of the Mizrachi...Mizrachi has other Kibbutzim yet.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: Yes.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:32:16.658
Solomon Horowitz: And then there are just ordinary Zionists, and there are leftist parties. There are all kind of parties.

00:32:16.658 --> 00:32:18.723
David Boder: Yes. All of them have Kibbutzim?

00:32:18.723 --> 00:32:20.563
Solomon Horowitz: Yes, all have Kibbutzim. All have Kibbutzim. and all...

00:32:20.563 --> 00:32:24.196
David Boder: You have to excuse me, but in America...I am in another...

00:32:24.196 --> 00:32:24.648
Solomon Horowitz: Yes, yes, yes.

00:32:24.648 --> 00:32:25.342
David Boder: . . . field.

00:32:25.342 --> 00:32:25.538
Solomon Horowitz: Yes.

00:32:25.538 --> 00:32:26.608
David Boder: And I want to know. You understand?

00:32:26.608 --> 00:32:27.543
Solomon Horowitz: Of course, of course.

00:32:27.543 --> 00:32:27.724
David Boder: Yes.

00:32:27.724 --> 00:32:28.613
Solomon Horowitz: I will tell you all I know.

00:32:28.613 --> 00:32:28.825
David Boder: Yes?

00:32:28.825 --> 00:32:32.458
Solomon Horowitz: All have Kibbutzim, but this I have to bring to your attention. Everybody endeavors to get out of Poland.

00:32:32.458 --> 00:32:32.669
David Boder: Yes.

00:32:32.669 --> 00:32:45.272
Solomon Horowitz: The leftists even more than the Agudah. All endeavor to get out of Poland, because in this all parties are agreed, that there is no more room for a Jew in Poland. Such doesn’t exist! All agree on that.

00:32:45.272 --> 00:32:45.574
David Boder: And?

00:32:45.574 --> 00:32:51.800
Solomon Horowitz: And we were brought over. I...I came with a transport of the Agudah to Prague, to Czechoslovakia. And from Prague...

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.850
David Boder: How did you cross the border?

00:32:53.850 --> 00:33:00.423
Solomon Horowitz: The border we crossed somewhat legally. It was said the border guards had been bribed a little. A whole that...It was quite an undertaking.

00:33:00.423 --> 00:33:00.785
David Boder: Yes.

00:33:00.785 --> 00:33:02.926
Solomon Horowitz: It was successful. That transport left almost legally.

00:33:02.926 --> 00:33:05.896
David Boder: That transport went how? On foot, or in a...a...

00:33:05.896 --> 00:33:06.333
Solomon Horowitz: No, no, no.

00:33:06.333 --> 00:33:07.177
David Boder: In busses?

00:33:07.177 --> 00:33:11.399
Solomon Horowitz: No. We rode...we embarked in Warsaw, and we rode as far as Prague. We rode...

00:33:11.399 --> 00:33:12.500
David Boder: In what? In [word not clear]?

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:13.088
Solomon Horowitz: In...in a train.

00:33:13.088 --> 00:33:13.465
David Boder: In a train.

00:33:13.465 --> 00:33:14.475
Solomon Horowitz: By railroad, by railroad.

00:33:14.475 --> 00:33:17.158
David Boder: Did you buy your tickets or were they free? Or...

00:33:17.158 --> 00:33:23.701
Solomon Horowitz: The tickets were bought till...till the...till the border, and then we bought tickets again. Our transport was as if a bit legal.

00:33:23.701 --> 00:33:24.033
David Boder: Yes.

00:33:24.033 --> 00:33:27.395
Solomon Horowitz: Because it was somehow worked through with...with an understanding with the authorities...

00:33:27.395 --> 00:33:27.531
David Boder: Yes.

00:33:27.531 --> 00:33:38.099
Solomon Horowitz: . . . who gave a permit. And there were some kind of passports. It was illegal and legal, but in any case somewhat legally. And we arrived in good order. However the transports that are leaving now walk already about twenty-odd kilometers.

00:33:38.099 --> 00:33:38.566
David Boder: Hm.

00:33:38.566 --> 00:33:40.104
Solomon Horowitz: Troubles are already happening at the borders.

00:33:40.104 --> 00:33:40.647
David Boder: Hm.

00:33:40.647 --> 00:33:49.421
Solomon Horowitz: They are arriving naked and barefoot. And still thousands of Jews are leaving Poland. People are breaking out by any means in their power, because there had been already burned offerings, because there are pogroms in Poland.

00:33:49.421 --> 00:33:50.823
David Boder: Hm.

00:33:50.823 --> 00:33:54.607
Solomon Horowitz: Arriving in France, as you know, we arrived in Hénonville, and here...

00:33:54.607 --> 00:33:57.366
David Boder: How did you cross? For Prague you went where to?

00:33:57.366 --> 00:33:58.165
Solomon Horowitz: To Paris, to Paris.

00:33:58.165 --> 00:34:00.441
David Boder: How did you travel, by train or how?

00:34:00.441 --> 00:34:01.768
Solomon Horowitz: By train, by train, by train from Prague to Paris.

00:34:01.768 --> 00:34:04.210
David Boder: And who provided the food? Who provided the...

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:07.527
Solomon Horowitz: And who provided all the things? There is an Agudah in Prague.

00:34:07.527 --> 00:34:07.964
David Boder: Hm.

00:34:07.964 --> 00:34:09.773
Solomon Horowitz: And there is an Agudah in France.

00:34:09.773 --> 00:34:10.105
David Boder: Yes.

00:34:10.105 --> 00:34:12.381
Solomon Horowitz: And there is the Vaad Hatzala [words not clear — interrupted].

00:34:12.381 --> 00:34:12.623
David Boder: The what?

00:34:12.623 --> 00:34:14.507
Solomon Horowitz: The Vaad Hatzala from America.

00:34:14.507 --> 00:34:14.899
David Boder: Hm.

00:34:14.899 --> 00:34:17.131
Solomon Horowitz: In America there exists such a rescue movement...

00:34:17.131 --> 00:34:17.387
David Boder: Yes.

00:34:17.387 --> 00:34:18.925
Solomon Horowitz: . . . rescue movement, Vaad Hatzala.

00:34:18.925 --> 00:34:19.572
David Boder: Vaad Hatzala?

00:34:19.572 --> 00:34:20.604
Solomon Horowitz: Vaad Hatzala.

00:34:20.604 --> 00:34:21.296
David Boder: Vaad Hatzala.

00:34:21.296 --> 00:34:23.192
Solomon Horowitz: Vaad Hatzala. That means Committee for Rescue.

00:34:23.192 --> 00:34:23.622
David Boder: Yes.

00:34:23.622 --> 00:34:32.619
Solomon Horowitz: Rescue committee. The Vaad Hatzala is now spread over the whole...the whole of Europe. And they rescue the Shaarith Haplatim. Their mission is to rescue the Shaarith Haplatim.

00:34:32.619 --> 00:34:35.658
David Boder: What does it mean, Shaarith Haplatim? The survivors?

00:34:35.658 --> 00:34:37.103
Solomon Horowitz: [Words not clear] don’t help the killed, the survivors.

00:34:37.103 --> 00:34:39.218
David Boder: But what do the two words mean?

00:34:39.218 --> 00:34:43.341
Solomon Horowitz: Shaaro [?] is survived. Haplatim, who had escaped.

00:34:43.341 --> 00:34:44.072
David Boder: Escaped...

00:34:44.072 --> 00:34:44.674
Solomon Horowitz: Escaped.

00:34:44.674 --> 00:34:46.368
David Boder: The survivors of those who had escaped.

00:34:46.368 --> 00:34:48.354
Solomon Horowitz: Of...yes. The survivors of those who escaped...

00:34:48.354 --> 00:34:48.565
David Boder: Yes.

00:34:48.565 --> 00:34:50.440
Solomon Horowitz: . . . who had succeeded in saving their lives...

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:50.599
David Boder: Yes.

00:34:50.599 --> 00:34:52.224
Solomon Horowitz: . . . in the forests. Shaarith Haplatim means that.

00:34:52.224 --> 00:34:52.525
David Boder: Yes.

00:34:52.525 --> 00:34:59.326
Solomon Horowitz: And the Vaad Hatzala, it has the mission to rescue the Shaarith Haplatim, and to take them out from the dangerous countries...

00:34:59.326 --> 00:34:59.726
David Boder: Hm.

00:34:59.726 --> 00:35:07.851
Solomon Horowitz: . . . and bring them, for the time being, into such a country where a Jew can more or less move freely. He is still na vanat [roaming and wandering], but he is able to move freely.

00:35:07.851 --> 00:35:08.973
David Boder: He is still what?

00:35:08.973 --> 00:35:11.350
Solomon Horowitz: Na vanat [roaming and wandering]. He is not in his own home.

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:11.832
David Boder: Yes.

00:35:11.832 --> 00:35:20.447
Solomon Horowitz: He has no place. He has no place to sleep. He is still in...in bad circumstances as to food and...and so forth. For instance, we here are...We live under hard conditions. Here, indeed, in Hénonville

00:35:20.447 --> 00:35:20.937
David Boder: Yes.

00:35:20.937 --> 00:36:28.884
Solomon Horowitz: But still we are in a country where we can move about freely. The Jew is a man equal to all men in France. I can go out in France as a Jew with a beard. As a religious Jew. And I can ride on all those...on...on the Metros, on the Busses, the same as all...as all...as all people. This we have. In this [respect] we are saved. And furthermore, you should know that all the Jews have an aim, to go to Israel. All of them from Agudah Israel and from other parties have the aim, simply to have as their own a little piece of home, a little piece of country [?]. Some people who have relatives in America are struggling to get to America, because, for the time being, the road to the Land of Israel is complicated. But the majority consists of [us] idealists who, in spite of the situation there being difficult, we want solely to come to Eretz Israel. And this, the hope of the...this is...of the...of the...this is the...the expectation of all the Kibbutzim, that people are waiting, that any moment they will be able to tear themselves through into Eretz Israel, whether legally or illegally. To us Eretz Israel is always legal. Our journey to Eretz Israel is legal because it is our country, and we are going there as to our own. This is our hope.

00:36:28.884 --> 00:36:39.635
David Boder: Rabbi Horowitz, would you please tell me something, a little about Hénonville. How many people are here? What does one do here, and how did they come, and...and so forth?

00:36:39.635 --> 00:36:43.186
Solomon Horowitz: Here...here in Hénonville we are a kind of Hachshara.

00:36:43.186 --> 00:36:44.068
David Boder: Hm, here is a Hachshara?

00:36:44.068 --> 00:36:54.639
Solomon Horowitz: Hachshara. What does Hachshara mean? It means that it is a preparation for Eretz Israel. We want to come to Eretz Israel as active people.

00:36:54.639 --> 00:36:56.574
David Boder: What does the word Hachshara mean?

00:36:56.574 --> 00:36:59.652
Solomon Horowitz: Hachshara means...means...means preparation.

00:36:59.652 --> 00:37:00.043
David Boder: Preparation.

00:37:00.043 --> 00:37:00.886
Solomon Horowitz: Preparation.

00:37:00.886 --> 00:37:01.316
David Boder: Hm.

00:37:01.316 --> 00:37:25.238
Solomon Horowitz: We want to prepare ourselves, build our bodily conditions, so that we should be able to act-...actively to build the land, not come there as people who have to be assured an existence, but capable of building and creating. Here in Hénonville exists a Kibbutz. People work at gardening. People work on the field. People work at carpentry. People work at tailoring.

00:37:25.238 --> 00:37:25.720
David Boder: Hm.

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:39.871
Solomon Horowitz: People work as painters, at shoe making. And all these...everyone learns according to his trade, for which he is capable, [so] he should come to Eretz Israel as a tradesman, so he should be able with his trade to help in building the land. We should be able by ourselves to conduct all the branches of life.

00:37:39.871 --> 00:37:40.172
David Boder: Hm.

00:37:40.172 --> 00:37:42.429
Solomon Horowitz: We shouldn’t need any protectorate over us.

00:37:42.429 --> 00:37:47.153
David Boder: And how is this...how...how many people are there here in Hénonville?

00:37:47.153 --> 00:37:53.071
Solomon Horowitz: Now there are arriving more. Here there were already over two hundred. Now there could be assembled about three hundred.

00:37:53.071 --> 00:37:53.643
David Boder: Hm.

00:37:53.643 --> 00:37:55.388
Solomon Horowitz: There will be installed a seminary, too.

00:37:55.388 --> 00:37:56.291
David Boder: A...a Yeshiva?

00:37:56.291 --> 00:37:59.580
Solomon Horowitz: A Yeshiva, yes. I as a spiritual leader...

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:00.401
David Boder: Hm.

00:38:00.401 --> 00:38:05.878
Solomon Horowitz: I, Horowitz, as the spiritual leader see to it that all these labors should be carried out in the spirit of the Torah.

00:38:05.878 --> 00:38:06.308
David Boder: Hm.

00:38:06.308 --> 00:38:09.708
Solomon Horowitz: That means, for instance, in the morning when we get up...

00:38:09.708 --> 00:38:09.919
David Boder: Hm.

00:38:09.919 --> 00:00:00.000
Solomon Horowitz: Everything is punctual. At six o’clock there is a bell. It rings. Everybody has to stand on the square. Up and about.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:38:16.750
David Boder: Hm.

00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:33.489
Solomon Horowitz: The people are taught punctuality. He should know punctually. He should do everything punctually. Until eight o’clock there is a prayer and breakfast. Prayer first. After breakfast I give a lecture studying the Torah. I give a lecture to the men. They are taught for an hour or two. Then people go to work.

00:38:33.489 --> 00:38:34.482
David Boder: Hm.

00:38:34.482 --> 00:38:35.927
Solomon Horowitz: People go to work until dinner.

00:38:35.927 --> 00:38:37.441
David Boder: And at what time do people go to work?

00:38:37.441 --> 00:38:39.707
Solomon Horowitz: People go to work at nine. At nine everybody has to be at work.

00:38:39.707 --> 00:38:39.897
David Boder: Hm.

00:38:39.897 --> 00:38:41.260
Solomon Horowitz: People work eight hours a day.

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:41.441
David Boder: Hm.

00:38:41.441 --> 00:38:51.049
Solomon Horowitz: Eight...eight hours one works. At nine people go to work...twelve...until twelve or half past. The bell rings. People know it is dinner. Everybody leaves the work and goes to eat dinner.

00:38:51.049 --> 00:38:51.810
David Boder: Hm.

00:38:51.810 --> 00:00:00.000
Solomon Horowitz: After dinner, at two...two o’clock the bell rings again. People know and go to work again, and until six people work.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:38:57.958
David Boder: Hm.

00:38:57.958 --> 00:38:59.682
Solomon Horowitz: At six people come home.

00:38:59.682 --> 00:39:10.846
David Boder: [In English] This concludes Spool number 120. [End of Spool 120.]

00:39:10.846 --> 00:39:16.407
David Boder: [In English] This is Spool 121. I continue with the Rabbi Solomon Horowitz.

00:39:16.407 --> 00:39:23.613
David Boder: [In Yiddish] And so, Rabbi, would you tell me...you have described to me a little of Hénonville. Now I should like to ask you a question.

00:39:23.613 --> 00:39:24.757
Solomon Horowitz: Yes. I...I want to add [word not clear]...

00:39:24.757 --> 00:39:27.384
David Boder: Yes, go ahead. Say anything you want. The microphone is yours.

00:39:27.384 --> 00:40:00.634
Solomon Horowitz: Yes. I want to add something about the life, how here, really, people strive that there be a brotherly life. One for another would walk into fire. The love of one for another becomes here forged together. All of us are constantly together. One treasury, one food, one treatment. When one gets married here, it is a joyful event for everyone. Everyone joins in the happiness. A joy the same as if his own brother would...would get married. And his life creates in the people a great love of one for another. This is almost the...the most important asset of the life in a kibbutz.

00:40:00.634 --> 00:40:01.576
David Boder: Hm.

00:40:01.576 --> 00:40:20.422
Solomon Horowitz: That it creates a bond of one another. Everyone is taken by love of one for another, with loyalty because one...one loses the individual [personal] problems, the individual endeavors, and everything ties into one collective endeavor. We all have one aim and one endeavor.

00:40:20.422 --> 00:40:23.810
David Boder: Eh...I would like to ask you...

00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:23.991
Solomon Horowitz: Yes.

00:40:23.991 --> 00:40:24.692
David Boder: . . . a question.

00:40:24.692 --> 00:40:25.805
Solomon Horowitz: Yes.

00:40:25.805 --> 00:40:27.821
David Boder: The old Jewish life...

00:40:27.821 --> 00:40:28.814
Solomon Horowitz: Yes.

00:40:28.814 --> 00:40:35.645
David Boder: . . . was that planned as a collective life and not as a family life and an individual life?

00:40:35.645 --> 00:40:36.286
Solomon Horowitz: Yes.

00:40:36.286 --> 00:40:39.695
David Boder: I would like to know how...how do you understand the...

00:40:39.695 --> 00:40:40.357
Solomon Horowitz: In the Torah?

00:40:40.357 --> 00:40:42.464
David Boder: In the Torah, yes.

00:40:42.464 --> 00:40:47.498
Solomon Horowitz: [In] our Torah, as you know, there is a main tenet: ‘L’haftu le rayachu komochu.’

00:40:47.498 --> 00:40:48.521
David Boder: What does it mean?

00:40:48.521 --> 00:40:52.403
Solomon Horowitz: That means to love your...your comrade the same as yourself.

00:40:52.403 --> 00:40:56.233
David Boder: Where is that in the Torah? Where is it written?

00:40:56.233 --> 00:40:58.099
Solomon Horowitz: The Torah is to us...us...

00:40:58.099 --> 00:41:00.506
David Boder: No, I mean what you just said, that...that...

00:41:00.506 --> 00:41:02.011
Solomon Horowitz: ‘L’haftu le rayachu komochu.’

00:41:02.011 --> 00:41:02.562
David Boder: Yes.

00:41:02.562 --> 00:41:05.851
Solomon Horowitz: That was said by God, and Moses wrote it down.

00:41:05.851 --> 00:41:09.170
David Boder: Can you give me the verse? Where is it?

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:10.052
Solomon Horowitz: Yes!

00:41:10.052 --> 00:41:11.144
David Boder: Where is it?

00:41:11.144 --> 00:41:13.431
Solomon Horowitz: ‘L’haftu l’rayachu w’komoch. Annee Adoshem’ [Love thy neighbor as thyself. I am God].

00:41:13.431 --> 00:41:14.213
David Boder: Yes?

00:41:14.213 --> 00:41:17.614
Solomon Horowitz: That must be in Ki Tetzay [see Note 3 at end of chapter].

00:41:17.614 --> 00:41:22.437
David Boder: I would like to know it, you understand. The...the Christians are always claiming that this is their...[i.e., was first proclaimed by the New Testament — see same Note 3]...

00:41:22.437 --> 00:41:24.273
Solomon Horowitz: They took it from us.

00:41:24.273 --> 00:41:24.824
David Boder: Yes?

00:41:24.824 --> 00:41:28.775
Solomon Horowitz: They took it from Torah. This is written clearly in the Torah. When I look it up I shall tell you the exact place.

00:41:28.775 --> 00:41:29.145
David Boder: Yes.

00:41:29.145 --> 00:41:30.680
Solomon Horowitz: But this...I shall look it up and...

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:30.960
David Boder: Yes.

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:31.481
Solomon Horowitz: [Words not clear.]

00:41:31.481 --> 00:41:31.610
David Boder: Yes.

00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:32.904
Solomon Horowitz: I will tell you the exact place.

00:41:32.904 --> 00:41:33.175
David Boder: Hm.

00:41:33.175 --> 00:41:34.288
Solomon Horowitz: The verse and everything. [See same Note 3 at end of chapter.]

00:41:34.288 --> 00:41:34.349
David Boder: Hm.

00:41:34.349 --> 00:41:36.434
Solomon Horowitz: But that it is in the Torah, that is for sure. Sure.

00:41:36.434 --> 00:41:36.705
David Boder: Yes.

00:41:36.705 --> 00:41:37.939
Solomon Horowitz: I can soon tell you...

00:41:37.939 --> 00:41:38.369
David Boder: Yes.

00:41:38.369 --> 00:41:38.730
Solomon Horowitz: . . . the location of the place.

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:39.031
David Boder: Nu?

00:41:39.031 --> 00:41:43.485
Solomon Horowitz: [Words not clear.] If not more...[chuckle] the important thing is to carry it out exactly.

00:41:43.485 --> 00:41:44.457
David Boder: Yes.

00:41:44.457 --> 00:41:57.435
Solomon Horowitz: All right. This is the main concept. The main concept of our Torah is that one man should love another and in dealing with another not to deceive another, live a decent life, and in every...everyone...

00:41:57.435 --> 00:42:02.277
David Boder: One moment. [Testing the microphone.] Live a decent life, you said. Nu, go on.

00:42:02.277 --> 00:42:04.714
Solomon Horowitz: And...[pause]...

00:42:04.714 --> 00:42:06.080
David Boder: Yes?

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:12.808
Solomon Horowitz: And...and endeavor to do such things that should bring usefulness to the whole community, not only to oneself.

00:42:12.808 --> 00:42:16.058
David Boder: Hm. Nu, I want to ask you another question.

00:42:16.058 --> 00:42:16.368
Solomon Horowitz: Yes.

00:42:16.368 --> 00:42:18.875
David Boder: I understand that there are here...

00:42:18.875 --> 00:42:19.275
Solomon Horowitz: Yes.

00:42:19.275 --> 00:42:24.992
David Boder: . . . Russian women...eh...who became Jews.

00:42:24.992 --> 00:42:26.798
Solomon Horowitz: Who became converted?

00:42:26.798 --> 00:42:27.379
David Boder: Yes.

00:42:27.379 --> 00:42:28.592
Solomon Horowitz: Where? Here in the Kibbutz?

00:42:28.592 --> 00:42:35.883
David Boder: No, no, no. I was told that there are here, here in Hénonville. Women who were Christians before [Footnote: For some information on this topic see interview with Mrs. Clara Neuman, Spool 121B.].

00:42:35.883 --> 00:42:37.156
Solomon Horowitz: Hm. Geirim, geirim, geirim [strangers].

00:42:37.156 --> 00:42:39.602
David Boder: Would you tell me something about them?

00:42:39.602 --> 00:42:45.500
Solomon Horowitz: I don’t know the story. Why they became converted I don’t know. I know only that they are extremely religious Jews. That only, I know.

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:49.171
David Boder: Yes. You don’t know their story, how they have come? What...

00:42:49.171 --> 00:42:51.217
Solomon Horowitz: No. I met them in the group...

00:42:51.217 --> 00:42:51.518
David Boder: Yes?

00:42:51.518 --> 00:42:53.053
Solomon Horowitz: . . . leaving Poland for here.

00:42:53.053 --> 00:42:53.273
David Boder: Yes?

00:42:53.273 --> 00:42:58.367
Solomon Horowitz: I met them in the group, and seeing that the Torah says thirty-six times, ‘L’haftu mes’hagayra’ [Love the stranger within the gates]...

00:42:58.367 --> 00:42:58.728
David Boder: What does it mean?

00:42:58.728 --> 00:43:01.948
Solomon Horowitz: In the Torah it says thirty-six times to love a stranger, to give assistance to a stranger...

00:43:01.948 --> 00:43:02.249
David Boder: Yes.

00:43:02.249 --> 00:43:09.540
Solomon Horowitz: . . . who comes over to our religion. He has to be treated even better because he feels so...so lonesome, so...so not...not...not wanted.

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:09.699
David Boder: Yes.

00:43:09.699 --> 00:43:12.257
Solomon Horowitz: It is self-understood that we are very friendly towards these strangers [Geirim].

00:43:12.257 --> 00:43:12.408
David Boder: Hm.

00:43:12.408 --> 00:43:17.683
Solomon Horowitz: And we...we give them very much attention. And they are feeling very well, and they are highly religious.

00:43:17.683 --> 00:43:17.842
David Boder: Hm.

00:43:17.842 --> 00:43:20.430
Solomon Horowitz: They take part in all the Jewish things. They study.

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:20.671
David Boder: Hm.

00:43:20.671 --> 00:43:26.548
Solomon Horowitz: And they are highly religious. And I only know that...that they are very satisfied. But their history, how they came to it, that I don’t know.

00:43:26.548 --> 00:43:26.647
David Boder: Hm.

00:43:26.647 --> 00:43:27.520
Solomon Horowitz: It is unknown to me.

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:36.466
David Boder: Hm. Nu, when do you think this Kibbutz will leave for Eretz Israel?

00:43:36.466 --> 00:43:43.516
Solomon Horowitz: There has left already a transport from...from...from Hénonville for Eretz Israel about two months ago. A hundred and forty people...

00:43:43.516 --> 00:43:44.479
David Boder: Illegally?

00:43:44.479 --> 00:43:45.111
Solomon Horowitz: Illegally...

00:43:45.111 --> 00:43:45.421
David Boder: Yes?

00:43:45.421 --> 00:43:47.115
Solomon Horowitz: . . . who are writing very good letters...

00:43:47.115 --> 00:43:47.416
David Boder: Hm.

00:43:47.416 --> 00:43:49.197
Solomon Horowitz: . . . and are happily in Eretz Israel...

00:43:49.197 --> 00:43:49.468
David Boder: Hm.

00:43:49.468 --> 00:43:55.459
Solomon Horowitz: . . . in spite of the situation still being so...so...We are hoping any day...But Hénonville a transit [place] for thousands of more Jews.

00:43:55.459 --> 00:43:55.817
David Boder: Hm.

00:43:55.817 --> 00:43:58.593
Solomon Horowitz: France is an important point now.

00:43:58.593 --> 00:43:59.144
David Boder: Hm.

00:43:59.144 --> 00:44:20.367
Solomon Horowitz: Thousands of Jews are still endeavoring to come here. And Hénonville is a point that when these two hundred Jews leave, a place is made for a new two hundred Jews. As long as the repatriation will last in...in Europe, so long, I think, Hénonville will exist, until there will be created a real Jewish Home and life will become normal. Hénonville is a point that is not for a day or two.

00:44:20.367 --> 00:44:20.587
David Boder: Hm.

00:44:20.587 --> 00:44:30.827
Solomon Horowitz: It is transit point. And every Saturday strangers come to us. Even those who are not from Hénonville, who are living in Paris. They come here for every Saturday, thirty, forty guests, to take part in our Sabbath...[See interview with Mr. Pinkhus Rosenfeld in forthcoming volumes, Spools 130B and 131.]

00:44:30.827 --> 00:44:30.926
David Boder: Hm.

00:44:30.926 --> 00:44:40.856
Solomon Horowitz: . . . which is most interesting. We spend a Sabbath from beginning to end full of Godliness, with diffidence, with lectures, with study. The whole Sabbath is to us a spiritual day, free of labor.

00:44:40.856 --> 00:44:40.946
David Boder: Hm.

00:44:40.946 --> 00:00:00.000
Solomon Horowitz: Here there are such religious people. Saturday no work is done, but the whole day, Saturday, is spent in songs with...with dances. People are dancing together. [he refers to ritual dances of the Khassidic sect].

00:00:00.000 --> 00:44:46.002
David Boder: Hm.

00:44:46.002 --> 00:45:02.862
Solomon Horowitz: We sing together, and we eat together, and lectures about the Torah are given. And every week according to the Sedra[ a weekly portion of the Pentateuch]...the spirit of the Sedra is explained, the devine meanings. And all these thing and the good customs are taught. I teach Perak every Saturday. I teach Perak. Perak, that means about the customs.

00:45:02.862 --> 00:45:03.232
David Boder: Yes.

00:45:03.232 --> 00:45:12.831
Solomon Horowitz: How a man should be. He should...should...should find for himself the customs. And that is how Sabbath is spent. For every Sabbath there are thirty, forty guests here who come simply to see how Jews are living together spiritually.

00:45:12.831 --> 00:45:15.428
David Boder: What kind of guests are they, also from Kibbutzim or...?

00:45:15.428 --> 00:45:32.438
Solomon Horowitz: No, no, no, not from Kibbutzim. Just from Paris. People who...who are going...are waiting for visas to go to America, to Chicago, to Canada. But they have heard about Heno so they come out here for the Sabbath. And we, from our food, we share with [them] no matter who, as many guests as there come. We eat collectively together. And Sunday they take leave and depart.

00:45:32.438 --> 00:45:32.619
David Boder: Hm.

00:45:32.619 --> 00:45:35.306
Solomon Horowitz: They simply come to partake [?] and see how a day is spent here.

00:45:35.306 --> 00:45:35.547
David Boder: Hm.

00:45:35.547 --> 00:45:40.671
Solomon Horowitz: We have organized all the things pertaining to Jewishness. For instance, now I am planning to make a Mikvah [ritual bath].

00:45:40.671 --> 00:45:41.153
David Boder: Hm.

00:45:41.153 --> 00:45:48.685
Solomon Horowitz: That is needed for a family cleanliness, family life. It plays a great role in the Torah. It is one of the most important commands of the Torah: To lead a clean family...family life.

00:45:48.685 --> 00:45:49.446
David Boder: Hm.

00:45:49.446 --> 00:46:01.272
Solomon Horowitz: And we are hoping to build now a Mikvah. The Sabbath is very much observed here with all the finest details. And here is being led, as one says, a socially constructive life, and a religious, Godly life. That is how it is led here in the Kibbutz.

00:46:01.272 --> 00:46:05.464
David Boder: Tell me, will you allow me to use the machine on Saturday?

00:46:05.464 --> 00:46:09.325
Solomon Horowitz: Saturday? Here? [In an apologetic whisper apparently to avoid the recording of his words] No. Not here.

00:46:09.325 --> 00:46:10.959
David Boder: I am not writing...

00:46:10.959 --> 00:46:11.901
Solomon Horowitz: [Whisper] But it is an apparatus...

00:46:11.901 --> 00:46:12.542
David Boder: [Chuckle. Words not clear.]

00:46:12.542 --> 00:46:14.838
Solomon Horowitz: . . . an apparatus. It is not [word not clear].

00:46:14.838 --> 00:46:15.088
David Boder: Nu?

00:46:15.088 --> 00:46:17.474
Solomon Horowitz: What for? You want to come out for Saturday? You are very welcome.

00:46:17.474 --> 00:46:22.569
David Boder: I want to stay here for...I am leaving already for America on Tuesday.

00:46:22.569 --> 00:46:25.166
David Boder: But I still want to talk with many people here.

00:46:25.166 --> 00:46:26.680
Solomon Horowitz: Will you stay over Saturday?

00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:34.874
David Boder: Well, I can’t remain over...I want to stay here Friday and maybe Saturday till...but only if I could use the machine.

00:46:34.874 --> 00:46:35.485
Solomon Horowitz: No, no.

00:46:35.485 --> 00:46:35.795
David Boder: No.

00:46:35.795 --> 00:46:42.183
Solomon Horowitz: Saturday it is not allowed. But you could on Saturday night. You could...we sit at...we have organized now. Saturday night is the termination of Sabbath.

00:46:42.183 --> 00:46:42.304
David Boder: Yes.

00:46:42.304 --> 00:46:43.487
Solomon Horowitz: It is also spent in a Sabbath manner.

00:46:43.487 --> 00:46:43.677
David Boder: Yes.

00:46:43.677 --> 00:46:51.088
Solomon Horowitz: Sabbath night is spent by Khassidim...’Melava malka’ [the exit of the queen] it is called by us. Saturday night you could record as it...Saturday, more or less.

00:46:51.088 --> 00:46:51.449
David Boder: Yes.

00:46:51.449 --> 00:46:54.127
Solomon Horowitz: But on Saturday proper, it is Sabbath with us.

00:46:54.127 --> 00:46:54.428
David Boder: Yes.

00:46:54.428 --> 00:00:00.000
Solomon Horowitz: It is not permitted [words not clear].

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: And so, as you say.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:46:55.933
Solomon Horowitz: But on Saturday proper...

00:46:55.933 --> 00:47:02.171
David Boder: Nu? Is there anything more that you might want to say to the American Jews?

00:47:02.171 --> 00:00:00.000
Solomon Horowitz: To the American Jews. In the first place I am sending over my great gratitude for their initiative, for their help to all our brothers of the Shaarith Haplatim. To tell the truth, if not helped by America the Shaarith Haplatim would not be able to exist, and the surviving Jews would have simply fallen apart. Thanks to their initiative, their help in every sphere, that really strengthened the broken up, surviving Jews of the Shaarith Haplatim, and this gives them the possibility of existing anew and to begin living anew. But I want to tell our American brothers, they should know that the aid that they are giving is really very big. The aid is very important. But an adjustment we have not achieved yet. We wander from one country to another, whether we...we are sitting here in Kibbutz, or others in other places. But we lead a na vanat [roaming and wandering] life.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:48:11.041
David Boder: What does it mean?

00:48:11.041 --> 00:49:00.281
Solomon Horowitz: A hard life, and we don’t see the morning before us yet. We don’t see the salvation before us yet. The aim of all of us is Eretz Israel. And at present Eretz Israel is still so complicated. The entry to Eretz Israel is still to complicated with various frustration, with various obstacles. They should know, the American Jews, that indeed they are the only brothers who can save us, who can help us. And they should remember always to be in contact with all the Jews that find themselves in Europe, and to send messengers to every point to become acquainted with the conditions and with what they have to be helped. And to help with something really important, that means, to lead [us] out from Galuth [Diaspora] and to bring [us] into a little safe harbor.

00:49:00.281 --> 00:49:21.241
