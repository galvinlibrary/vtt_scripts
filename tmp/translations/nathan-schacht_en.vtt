00:03:19.131 --> 00:03:19.403
David Boder: Oh!

00:03:19.403 --> 00:03:19.961

00:03:20.187 --> 00:03:21.137
Nathan Schacht: On another truck.

00:03:21.137 --> 00:03:22.358
David Boder: Yes? Nu?

00:03:22.358 --> 00:03:30.484
Nathan Schacht: And I remained with the brothers and sister. I told them to escape, too. They did not want to. They were afraid. So I escaped by myself.

00:03:30.484 --> 00:03:32.368
David Boder: Who told you to escape?

00:03:32.368 --> 00:03:33.574
Nathan Schacht: I escaped by myself.

00:03:33.574 --> 00:03:34.690
David Boder: Oh, by yourself.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.097
Nathan Schacht: Yes.

00:03:35.097 --> 00:03:37.976

Nathan Schacht: Yes.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.982

00:03:39.982 --> 00:03:40.570
Nathan Schacht: Yes.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.967
David Boder: All right. And where did you go?

00:03:42.967 --> 00:03:50.610
Nathan Schacht: So I went to a gentile. I did not have anywhere to stay there, so I went to a gentile, to work. The gentile...

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.677
David Boder: Wait a moment. [Adjusting the equipment.] And so what kind of work did you do with this gentile?

00:03:55.677 --> 00:04:08.295
Nathan Schacht: I worked in the field. I worked everywhere, whatever he asked me to do. I worked in the forest. And then the gentile did not want to hide me. I had nothing to give him. He wanted me to give him something for hiding me.

00:04:08.295 --> 00:04:08.597
David Boder: Oh.

00:04:08.597 --> 00:04:13.285
Nathan Schacht: I had nothing. I had no papers to show whether I am a Pole or a Russian.

00:04:13.285 --> 00:04:13.798
David Boder: Nu?

00:04:13.798 --> 00:04:19.421
Nathan Schacht: He did not want to keep me, so I left. So I ran away into the forest. I went to the partisans.

00:04:19.421 --> 00:04:23.069
David Boder: Well, tell me, did the gentle know that you were a Jew?

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:23.883
Nathan Schacht: No.

00:04:23.883 --> 00:04:24.306
David Boder: No?

00:04:24.306 --> 00:04:29.628
Nathan Schacht: He did not know. If I had told him that I am a Jew he would have handed me over to the police.

00:04:29.628 --> 00:04:32.236
David Boder: Yes? But you had no papers.

00:04:32.236 --> 00:04:33.035
Nathan Schacht: No.

00:04:33.035 --> 00:04:35.432
David Boder: So the gentile told you that he cannot keep you without any papers.

00:04:35.432 --> 00:04:36.261
Nathan Schacht: Of course.

00:04:36.261 --> 00:04:36.427
David Boder: Nu?

00:04:36.427 --> 00:04:46.060
Nathan Schacht: He told me that if I had no papers he would not keep me. I had no papers. I must leave. He did not want to keep me. He was afraid.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.960
David Boder: Nu?

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:58.347
Nathan Schacht: Nu, so I ran away to the partisans. When I came there I did not see anybody, but one night I saw that there...partisans were there.

00:04:58.347 --> 00:04:58.935
David Boder: In the forest.

00:04:58.935 --> 00:05:08.538
Nathan Schacht: Yes, I saw them there. Afterwards I went there, but I did not see anyone. I walked towards the river, about two kilometers. I noticed a Russian partisan. I saw him.

00:05:08.538 --> 00:05:08.870
David Boder: Yes?

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:19.197
Nathan Schacht: He asked me where I was going. So I said, ‘I am going to earn something. I have no place to go.’ He asked me who I was and what...He questioned me about everything.

00:05:19.197 --> 00:05:19.680
David Boder: Yes?

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.559
Nathan Schacht: And then he took me to the captain.

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:22.801
David Boder: Yes?

00:05:22.801 --> 00:05:29.298
Nathan Schacht: He introduced me. He accepted me. He gave me food, everything he gave me. I was there eighteen months.

00:05:29.298 --> 00:05:29.690
David Boder: What?

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.635
Nathan Schacht: Over a year and a half I was there.

00:05:31.635 --> 00:05:32.555
David Boder: A year.

00:05:32.555 --> 00:05:33.384
Nathan Schacht: A year and a half.

00:05:33.384 --> 00:05:34.243
David Boder: Half a year?

00:05:34.243 --> 00:05:34.982
Nathan Schacht: A year and a half.

00:05:34.982 --> 00:05:37.017
David Boder: A year and a half. And how old were you?

00:05:37.017 --> 00:05:39.701
Nathan Schacht: I was then ten...eleven years old.

00:05:39.701 --> 00:05:40.289
David Boder: Eleven years.

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:41.178
Nathan Schacht: Yes.

00:05:41.178 --> 00:05:43.424
David Boder: What did you do there with the partisans?

00:05:43.424 --> 00:05:45.851
Nathan Schacht: I went scouting. I went...

00:05:45.851 --> 00:05:46.680
David Boder: Alone?

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:54.384
Nathan Schacht: No. With...with the Russians. I went scouting. I went for food to the gentiles.

00:05:54.384 --> 00:05:56.148
David Boder: Yes? What does it mean, ‘you went for food’?

00:05:56.148 --> 00:05:56.615
Nathan Schacht: What?

00:05:56.615 --> 00:05:59.223
David Boder: What does it mean, ‘you went for food to the gentiles’?

00:05:59.223 --> 00:06:02.434
Nathan Schacht: For all...for all Russians I brought food.

00:06:02.434 --> 00:06:03.384
David Boder: You brought food.

00:06:03.384 --> 00:06:03.912
Nathan Schacht: Food, yes.

00:06:03.912 --> 00:06:05.163
David Boder: How did you get it?

00:06:05.163 --> 00:06:08.434
Nathan Schacht: I went to the gentiles. I went with other Russians, not by myself.

00:06:08.434 --> 00:06:09.806
David Boder: Did you pay for the food?

00:06:09.806 --> 00:06:10.364
Nathan Schacht: No.

00:06:10.364 --> 00:06:11.796
David Boder: What did you do, take it away?

00:06:11.796 --> 00:06:14.600
Nathan Schacht: Of course. We had nothing to eat, so we went and took.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.756
David Boder: Aha. So you took [it] and ran away.

00:06:16.756 --> 00:06:17.073
Nathan Schacht: Yes.

00:06:17.073 --> 00:06:17.962
David Boder: And the gentile, what would he do?

00:06:17.962 --> 00:06:23.917
Nathan Schacht: They would do nothing. We would take everything. But it was reported [?]. One day the Germans made an offensive...

00:06:23.917 --> 00:06:24.264
David Boder: Yes?

00:06:24.264 --> 00:06:27.174
Nathan Schacht: They made an offensive on the Russians there in the forest.

00:06:27.174 --> 00:06:27.611
David Boder: Hm.

00:06:27.611 --> 00:06:35.993
Nathan Schacht: They started shooting. They mined the whole forest with mines. But...we had...had nothing to eat any more.

00:06:35.993 --> 00:06:36.265
David Boder: Hm.

00:06:36.265 --> 00:06:37.727
Nathan Schacht: So I went for food.

00:06:37.727 --> 00:06:38.134
David Boder: Nu?

00:06:38.134 --> 00:06:42.702
Nathan Schacht: We went there for food. I went and two other Russians.

00:06:42.702 --> 00:06:43.712
David Boder: Yes?

00:06:43.712 --> 00:06:47.014
Nathan Schacht: We went near the German trenches.

00:06:47.014 --> 00:06:47.511
David Boder: Yes?

00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:56.360
Nathan Schacht: We jumped over the trenches. We were going to a gentile for food. There were mines there. I was wounded. The other two were killed. [The spool here is very weak.]

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.556
David Boder: Aha.

00:06:56.556 --> 00:06:57.385

00:06:57.385 --> 00:06:59.224

00:06:59.224 --> 00:06:59.948

Nathan Schacht: Huh?

00:07:03.294 --> 00:07:06.204

00:07:06.204 --> 00:07:09.204
Nathan Schacht: All over. In the legs, in the arms, all over.

00:07:09.204 --> 00:07:09.626

00:07:20.464 --> 00:07:20.660
Nathan Schacht: Burst.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:21.519
David Boder: . . . had exploded, burst.

00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:21.911
Nathan Schacht: Yes.

00:07:21.911 --> 00:07:26.298
David Boder: And when was part of your ear torn off? At the same time?

00:07:26.298 --> 00:07:27.007
Nathan Schacht: Yes.

00:07:27.007 --> 00:07:44.510
David Boder: [In English] He is all rather mutilated. One half ear is missing, and he has shrapnel wounds, or wounds of...eh...shrapnel, or pieces of mines all over his body.

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:48.835
David Boder: [In Yiddish] Well, go on. Tell me, how many partisans were you...

00:07:48.835 --> 00:07:49.001
Nathan Schacht: What?

00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:49.423
David Boder: . . . in that forest?

00:07:49.423 --> 00:07:52.725
Nathan Schacht: In the forest? There were a thousand men, an entire company.

00:07:52.725 --> 00:07:55.484
David Boder: Thousand partisans? An entire company.

00:07:55.484 --> 00:07:56.042
Nathan Schacht: Yes.

00:07:56.042 --> 00:07:57.504
David Boder: What did one do there all day?

00:07:57.504 --> 00:08:03.926
Nathan Schacht: We made mines. Put mines under trains. Put mines under...

00:08:03.926 --> 00:08:04.137
David Boder: Yes?

00:08:04.137 --> 00:08:09.368
Nathan Schacht: . . . the...everything, whatever we could. The front [lines] were not far from our forest.

00:08:09.368 --> 00:08:10.273
David Boder: Which front?

00:08:10.273 --> 00:08:11.404
Nathan Schacht: The German.

00:08:11.404 --> 00:08:12.444
David Boder: The German front.

00:08:12.444 --> 00:08:12.685
Nathan Schacht: Yes.

00:08:12.685 --> 00:08:14.268
David Boder: And the Russian front?

00:08:14.268 --> 00:08:15.459
Nathan Schacht: On the other side.

00:08:15.459 --> 00:08:16.409
David Boder: On the other side.

00:08:16.409 --> 00:08:16.726
Nathan Schacht: Yes.

00:08:16.726 --> 00:08:18.188
David Boder: And you were in the middle?

00:08:18.188 --> 00:08:19.907
Nathan Schacht: Yes, we were in the middle.

00:08:19.907 --> 00:08:21.008
David Boder: You were in the middle.

00:08:21.008 --> 00:08:23.526
Nathan Schacht: Yes. Here are the Germans.

00:08:23.526 --> 00:08:23.812
David Boder: Yes?

00:08:23.812 --> 00:08:25.093
Nathan Schacht: Here are the Russians, and here we were.

00:08:25.093 --> 00:08:29.254
David Boder: Did it not happen that the Russians shot at you?

00:08:29.254 --> 00:08:30.762
Nathan Schacht: No. The Germans were shooting at us.

00:08:30.762 --> 00:08:32.224
David Boder: Yes. But the Russians did not shoot.

00:08:32.224 --> 00:08:34.878
Nathan Schacht: No. The Russians, of course, knew that we were there.

00:08:34.878 --> 00:08:35.496
David Boder: Aha.

00:08:35.496 --> 00:08:37.682
Nathan Schacht: Afterwards, when I already was wounded...

00:08:37.682 --> 00:08:38.089
David Boder: Yes?

00:08:38.089 --> 00:08:42.174
Nathan Schacht: . . . the Russians came and took me away to a hospital.

00:08:42.174 --> 00:08:43.471
David Boder: To a Russian hospital.

00:08:43.471 --> 00:08:48.310
Nathan Schacht: Yes. I lay there about two days, and then the whole army came.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:49.004
David Boder: The Russian army.

00:08:49.004 --> 00:08:51.491
Nathan Schacht: Yes. They came and handed me over to a doctor.

00:08:51.491 --> 00:08:52.079
David Boder: Hm.

00:08:52.079 --> 00:08:56.044
Nathan Schacht: [Words not clear.] I lay in a hospital eight months.

00:08:56.044 --> 00:08:56.813
David Boder: Eight months?

00:08:56.813 --> 00:08:58.637
Nathan Schacht: Eight months I lay in the hospital.

00:08:58.637 --> 00:08:59.150
David Boder: Nu?

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.994
Nathan Schacht: I was supposed to be operated on. I still have a piece of shrapnel.

00:09:02.994 --> 00:09:04.622
David Boder: Do you still have a piece of shrapnel? Where?

00:09:04.622 --> 00:09:06.145
Nathan Schacht: Here in the side.

00:09:06.145 --> 00:09:06.974
David Boder: In the left side?

00:09:06.974 --> 00:09:07.276
Nathan Schacht: Yes.

00:09:07.276 --> 00:09:12.036
David Boder: [In English] He has a shrapnel wound and a piece of shrapnel right near the heart.

00:09:12.036 --> 00:09:14.105
David Boder: [In Yiddish] Nu, were you operated on?

00:09:14.105 --> 00:09:14.874
Nathan Schacht: No.

00:09:14.874 --> 00:09:15.191
David Boder: Why not?

00:09:15.191 --> 00:09:22.352
Nathan Schacht: I could not be operated on, because there were no...no...there was no...

00:09:22.352 --> 00:09:23.061
David Boder: Facilities.

00:09:23.061 --> 00:09:23.311
Nathan Schacht: Yes.

00:09:23.311 --> 00:09:23.507
David Boder: Yes?

00:09:23.507 --> 00:09:33.532
Nathan Schacht: They could not. It was in the front lines. I had to go farther, so I lay in the hospital. I lay there eight months. Then I was healed already.

00:09:33.532 --> 00:09:33.803
David Boder: Hm.

00:09:33.803 --> 00:09:37.195
Nathan Schacht: Except this shrapnel wound. Then I left the hospital.

00:09:37.195 --> 00:09:37.662
David Boder: Where to?

00:09:37.662 --> 00:09:40.330
Nathan Schacht: To a home in Cracow.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:41.853
David Boder: The Russians let you go?

00:09:41.853 --> 00:09:42.501
Nathan Schacht: Huh?

00:09:42.501 --> 00:09:42.787
David Boder: They left...

00:09:42.787 --> 00:09:44.551
Nathan Schacht: They did not let me. They did not want to let me.

00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:44.717
David Boder: Nu?

00:09:44.717 --> 00:09:55.436
Nathan Schacht: But there came Jews, and they took me away. [They said,] ‘Oh yes, you will go back there. Do you need more shrapnel fragments?’ So I went to Poland. So I was in Poland...[ Here the recording greatly improves.]

00:09:55.436 --> 00:09:59.823
David Boder: So you went to Poland. What happened there? To which city in Poland did you go?

00:09:59.823 --> 00:10:00.742
Nathan Schacht: To Cracow.

00:10:00.742 --> 00:10:03.139
David Boder: Yes. Speak slowly and loud. You understand?

00:10:03.139 --> 00:10:14.129
Nathan Schacht: Yes. I was in Cracow in a children’s home. Then I went to Zakopane. There we were in a children’s home, too. We could not stay there.

00:10:14.129 --> 00:10:14.838
David Boder: Why not?

00:10:14.838 --> 00:10:17.657
Nathan Schacht: Bandits came at night, and we could not remain there.

00:10:17.657 --> 00:10:19.918
David Boder: Tell me, where was that, in Zakopane?

00:10:19.918 --> 00:10:20.461
Nathan Schacht: Yes.

00:10:20.461 --> 00:10:23.823
David Boder: Tell me, how did you get to Zakopane? Did you go there by train?

00:10:23.823 --> 00:10:26.642
Nathan Schacht: Yes. I came there by...by auto.

00:10:26.642 --> 00:10:29.597
David Boder: By auto. With many other children?

00:10:29.597 --> 00:10:30.185
Nathan Schacht: Yes.

00:10:30.185 --> 00:10:31.557
David Boder: Who brought you there?

00:10:31.557 --> 00:10:32.266
Nathan Schacht: What?

00:10:32.266 --> 00:10:33.517
David Boder: Who brought you there?

00:10:33.517 --> 00:10:35.145
Nathan Schacht: The woman director who is here.

00:10:35.145 --> 00:10:39.080
David Boder: Oh! The woman teacher from here! Mrs. Kuechler...Kuechler? [See Mrs. Kuechler, Chapter 58.]

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.060
Nathan Schacht: Kuechler, yes, yes.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:42.668
David Boder: She...she found you where?

00:10:42.668 --> 00:10:45.653
Nathan Schacht: In Cracow. And she brought me to Zakopane to the children’s home.

00:10:45.653 --> 00:10:48.321
David Boder: Were you in Cracow with her in the children’s home?

00:10:48.321 --> 00:10:50.537
Nathan Schacht: No. I don’t know. She just came for the children. [Words not clear.]

00:10:50.537 --> 00:10:52.210
David Boder: Oh! She came to Cra-...

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:52.663
Nathan Schacht: Yes. And took away...

00:10:52.663 --> 00:10:54.005
David Boder: . . . and took away the children’s home.

00:10:54.005 --> 00:10:54.352
Nathan Schacht: Yes.

00:10:54.352 --> 00:10:55.151
David Boder: To Zakopane.

00:10:55.151 --> 00:10:55.407
Nathan Schacht: Yes.

00:10:55.407 --> 00:10:57.774
David Boder: Well, tell me, what happened in Zakopane?

00:10:57.774 --> 00:11:00.472
Nathan Schacht: It was all right there, but we could not stay there any more.

00:11:00.472 --> 00:11:01.256
David Boder: Why not?

00:11:01.256 --> 00:11:08.990
Nathan Schacht: They threw...on the house...The house had to be guarded by soldiers. We could not stay there any more.

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.789
David Boder: Why not?

00:11:09.789 --> 00:11:14.055
Nathan Schacht: Because there...eh...eh...because in Zakopane...

00:11:14.055 --> 00:11:14.387
David Boder: Yes?

00:11:14.387 --> 00:11:16.060
Nathan Schacht: there were bandits.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:16.965
David Boder: Who? Polish?

00:11:16.965 --> 00:11:17.704
Nathan Schacht: Polish

00:11:17.704 --> 00:11:19.257
David Boder: Nu, what did they do to you. They...

00:11:19.257 --> 00:11:20.870
Nathan Schacht: They killed Jews there.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:21.835
David Boder: Oh! They were killing Jews.

00:11:21.835 --> 00:11:24.232
Nathan Schacht: Yes. So we could not stay there.

00:11:24.232 --> 00:11:24.971
David Boder: Yes?

00:11:24.971 --> 00:11:28.906

00:11:28.906 --> 00:11:34.167

00:11:34.167 --> 00:11:35.072
Nathan Schacht: Yes.

00:11:35.072 --> 00:11:35.660

David Boder: Aha.

00:12:10.771 --> 00:12:15.188

00:12:15.429 --> 00:12:17.253

Nathan Schacht: They all were taken away.

00:12:58.304 --> 00:13:01.515
