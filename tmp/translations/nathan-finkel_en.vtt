David Boder: [In English] Munich, September the 24th, 193—, 1946, at the UNRRA University for displaced persons at the Deutsches Museum. The interviewee is now Nathan Finkel from Rovno, a Jewish student at the university. He will speak Russian.

00:00:21.128 --> 00:00:23.625
David Boder: [In Russian] Ah, how...How old are you?

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:25.414
Nathan Finkel: I am 26 years old.

00:00:25.414 --> 00:00:37.641
David Boder: So. Well, [sit down and?] [unintelligible] and speak like so, that [unintelligible]. Tell me please where you were when the war began.

00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:39.747
Nathan Finkel: When the war began, I was in Rovno.

00:00:39.747 --> 00:00:43.702
David Boder: So. And were the Russians in Rovno before the war?

00:00:43.702 --> 00:00:46.628
Nathan Finkel: [unintelligible]

00:00:46.628 --> 00:00:51.370
David Boder: No, no, no. I am thinking [unintelligible] when Rovno was in Poland.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.355
Nathan Finkel: Yes. It was in Poland.

00:00:52.355 --> 00:01:03.308
David Boder: Well, so. When the Germans entered [stutters] western Poland. Did the Russians enter, ah, did the Germans enter Rovno or did the Russians enter Rovno?

00:01:03.308 --> 00:01:05.751
Nathan Finkel: The Germans entered western Poland in 1939.

00:01:05.751 --> 00:01:11.583
David Boder: No, they got...they got to eastern Poland.

00:01:11.583 --> 00:01:12.952
Nathan Finkel: To eastern [unintelligible].

00:01:12.952 --> 00:01:24.196
David Boder: So, therefore, I am also saying: The Russians entered eastern Poland. Well, okay. You [unintelligible] of this time and continue then, tell me what happened to you?

00:01:24.196 --> 00:01:29.559
Nathan Finkel: I was working in Rovno from 1939, then I left in 1940 for [unintelligible].

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:34.276
David Boder: Well, wait a bit. When did the Russians enter Rovno?

00:01:34.276 --> 00:01:35.962
Nathan Finkel: In September 1939.

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:40.132
David Boder: Stop! What happened then?

00:01:40.132 --> 00:01:46.149
Nathan Finkel: Then I [unintelligible] from [my] family. We all stayed put.

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:47.130
David Boder: So.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:55.845
Nathan Finkel: I got work again. I left for L’vov to get a job. I studied at the Polytechnical in L’vov.

00:01:55.845 --> 00:01:57.928
David Boder: And did the Russian also capture L’vov?

00:01:57.928 --> 00:02:00.077
Nathan Finkel: Also. And also western Ukraine.

00:02:00.077 --> 00:02:02.894
David Boder: So. [both talking at once] Western Ukraine and...

00:02:02.894 --> 00:02:04.660
Nathan Finkel: [interrupting] Western Ukraine and eastern Poland.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.971
David Boder: So.

00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:05.956
Nathan Finkel: [unintelligible]

00:02:05.956 --> 00:02:07.576
David Boder: So.

00:02:07.576 --> 00:02:30.527
Nathan Finkel: In 1941, in June when the war had begun between Germany and Russian, I [unintelligible] after the start of the war, I went to Rovno. I was in Rovno three months in all, because very great persecutions had begun [unintelligible] by the Germans...By the Germans.

00:02:30.527 --> 00:02:31.922
David Boder: So.

00:02:31.922 --> 00:02:46.495
Nathan Finkel: Everyone was taken for work as soon as six months after the start of the war. Ah. In the month of December they already had killed seventeen thousand Jews in [about one week?].

00:02:46.495 --> 00:02:48.274
David Boder: How did they kill them?

00:02:48.274 --> 00:02:57.043
Nathan Finkel: They [divided?] from the morning all to gather in the square with [unintelligible] and it was forbidden to bring anything larger with themselves.

00:02:57.043 --> 00:02:57.645
David Boder: So.

00:02:57.645 --> 00:03:01.833
Nathan Finkel: And after everyone [unintelligible] [he only left?], it was those who didn’t work.

00:03:01.833 --> 00:03:02.494
David Boder: So.

00:03:02.494 --> 00:03:09.400
Nathan Finkel: And [unintelligible] to leave, that is from the SS, the SS [they got off?]

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.081
David Boder: So.

00:03:10.081 --> 00:03:23.642
Nathan Finkel: They were taken six kilometers outside of town. A place was already prepared there for them and they shot [them] for three days and they threw them already [into a hole?], into holes there and buried [them].

00:03:23.642 --> 00:03:25.432
David Boder: So.

00:03:25.432 --> 00:03:25.739
Nathan Finkel: I...

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.865
David Boder: [interrupting] Who dug these holes and who...

00:03:27.865 --> 00:03:29.536
Nathan Finkel: [interrupting] It is evident the Ukrainians did the digging.

00:03:29.536 --> 00:03:30.891
David Boder: So...Well, go on.

00:03:30.891 --> 00:03:39.714
Nathan Finkel: Only the Ukrainians were involved [with them?], and the Germans only [did the shooting?]. [That it, the Germans?] gave the orders. The Germans had [unintelligible].

00:03:39.714 --> 00:03:40.024
David Boder: So.

00:03:40.024 --> 00:03:43.266
Nathan Finkel: The only gave the orders. The Germans [so?].

00:03:43.266 --> 00:03:44.755
David Boder: So. Well, go on.

00:03:44.755 --> 00:03:46.505
Nathan Finkel: Well, I was no longer in Rovno then.

00:03:46.505 --> 00:03:47.257
David Boder: And where were you?

00:03:47.257 --> 00:03:52.725
Nathan Finkel: I had fled them and again a month after this I fled to western Poland.

00:03:52.725 --> 00:03:53.091
David Boder: So.

00:03:53.091 --> 00:03:56.127
Nathan Finkel: There it was a little better with the Jews, that...

00:03:56.127 --> 00:03:57.186
David Boder: [interrupting] To western Poland [unintelligible]?

00:03:57.186 --> 00:04:01.230
Nathan Finkel: To western Poland. I fled to the city of Sosnowiec.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.328
David Boder: [unintelligible]. So.

00:04:02.328 --> 00:04:13.225
Nathan Finkel: Yes, to Silesia. There was already a ghetto there, and I was in the ghetto a year and a half. I was working in [Skopje?], this is how they called it in German.

00:04:13.225 --> 00:04:14.164
David Boder: Yes.

00:04:14.164 --> 00:04:20.067
Nathan Finkel: It was very hard from morning to evening and it was especially bad for us with the food.

00:04:20.067 --> 00:04:21.006
David Boder: Well...

00:04:21.006 --> 00:05:24.563
Nathan Finkel: So. Because the Germans left very little for the ghettos. As early as [stammers] at this time they began [to take us?] to concentration camps. They [were bringing?] these places arbeitslagers [forced labor camps], that means we worked there. [For me?] my brother and I gathered and I was in the Gross-Rosen camp in Silesia. I worked all the time. I worked very hard. Of course [in the village?] [unintelligible] [we already had gotten bad?] only perhaps two men. We live in barracks. The food was very bad, we got ill and hundreds died there. A hundred men can be located in one room, and at the plant, at the factory, where we work there were such squares [we formed anxiety?]. It was very hard. The Germans treated us very badly.

00:05:24.563 --> 00:05:49.559
Nathan Finkel: I was working [of everything I didn’t have?] The last two months before the end of the war, I already was thinking that it would be my end, because I got sick several times, only [because of their?] [unintelligible] from too difficult work. I worked in the square.

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:50.261
David Boder: What does it mean, “in the square”?

00:05:50.261 --> 00:06:12.217
Nathan Finkel: In the square of this construction area. A military plant construction area. Several comrades were with me and they all died because I was somewhat [unintelligible], I managed to survive. We supplied kava. there was a lot of kava there, it was [camp?] kava. I got considerably ill [unintelligible] from it...

00:06:12.217 --> 00:06:12.524
David Boder: [interrupting] [unintelligible] you think?

00:06:12.524 --> 00:06:14.245
Nathan Finkel: Coffee, coffee. Yes.

00:06:14.245 --> 00:06:14.828
David Boder: So.

00:06:14.828 --> 00:06:26.047
Nathan Finkel: And very many died before it. [And hemorrhoids interfered?], and after the operation they did not [do?] and they died. At the other, in Silesia there were very many camps.

00:06:26.047 --> 00:06:28.766
David Boder: So.

00:06:28.766 --> 00:06:34.214
Nathan Finkel: The girls worked there. The majority, they worked in the factories...

00:06:34.214 --> 00:06:41.205
David Boder: [unintelligible]

00:06:41.205 --> 00:06:53.492
Nathan Finkel: I was in this camp in Gross-Rosen until March 1945. The Germans started to [unintelligible] us in March.

00:06:53.492 --> 00:06:55.598
David Boder: [How long?] were you in Gross-Rosen this time?

00:06:55.598 --> 00:06:57.922
Nathan Finkel: This time I was in Rosen a year and a half.

00:06:57.922 --> 00:06:59.316
David Boder: So.

00:06:59.316 --> 00:07:04.843
Nathan Finkel: [They evacuated?] us to the west. I ended up in Buchenwald.

00:07:04.843 --> 00:07:05.585
David Boder: So.

00:07:05.585 --> 00:08:07.273
Nathan Finkel: It was horrible in Buchenwald. There were hundreds, thousands of people, and all were in horrible conditions there because then there were being transferred and no one in the camp was healthy, the other [was] because the Germans were running before the Russians. Everyone was afraid. We were under [the fire of the sky?] in Buchenwald almost day and night, because there were no facilities for us. So I myself [successfully?] [unintelligible] worse. [Had to wait to the time?] until March 1945, many were spared [their lives?]. So, the final month, especially in the final days, [thousands?] died [a day], because [unintelligible] they didn’t take us [we went with it?], and we walked. So, on the road, who only showed weakness [unintelligible], they killed immediately. They killed [them]. So, there were fewer and fewer left on the road...

00:08:07.273 --> 00:08:10.606
David Boder: So, well, ah, ah, you were in Buchenwald.

00:08:10.606 --> 00:08:12.376
Nathan Finkel: Yes. I was there only a month and a half.

00:08:12.376 --> 00:08:12.742
David Boder: So.

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:21.187
Nathan Finkel: [I was there at the end of the war?]. [Quality of recording suddenly gets much worse here.] Well, then they liberated us and I of course was here in the American zone.

00:08:21.187 --> 00:08:33.468
David Boder: So. Well right now [weak and unintelligible] in the American zone [too weak and unintelligible], tell [me] in detail [weak and unintelligible].

00:08:33.468 --> 00:08:53.271
Nathan Finkel: From the very beginning of liberation I was in the Feldafing camp. It was a special camp for Jews. There were [six thousand?] [unintelligible]. Conditions were [unintelligible] [poor?]. [Unintelligible]. The American endeavored [in any?] [unintelligible] [with me?].

00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:55.278
David Boder: Who founded Feldafing?

00:08:55.278 --> 00:08:57.819
Nathan Finkel: The Americans founded Feldafing.

00:08:57.819 --> 00:09:00.459
David Boder: You know [unintelligible].

00:09:00.459 --> 00:09:01.467
Nathan Finkel: No, I don’t.

00:09:01.467 --> 00:09:04.720
David Boder: So, [unintelligible].

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:10.386
Nathan Finkel: [unintelligible]. Well, because I arrived [later?], I [did not avoid the very beginning?] and [also?] then it wasn’t.

00:09:10.386 --> 00:09:10.851
David Boder: So. Yes.

00:09:10.851 --> 00:09:36.857
Nathan Finkel: I was in this very camp until January 1946. In January 1946, I found out that [unintelligible] university here. I decided to come here to Munich to get involved. I got an apartment and in March [both talking at once]. I got a private apartment.

00:09:36.857 --> 00:09:38.034
David Boder: Did the German assign [it] to you?

00:09:38.034 --> 00:09:42.058
Nathan Finkel: Yes, the Germans assigned [it] to me, a private apartment. A good room.

00:09:42.058 --> 00:09:43.571
David Boder: You are what, a bachelor?

00:09:43.571 --> 00:09:47.734
Nathan Finkel: I’m a bachelor. I have a brother here. I have no one else from the family.

00:09:47.734 --> 00:09:49.682
David Boder: From where did [he take?] [your] brother?

00:09:49.682 --> 00:09:57.127
Nathan Finkel: My brother has been with me all the time, in the camp, too. We have been together since Szczecin. And here [unintelligible] all the time...

00:09:57.127 --> 00:09:58.472
David Boder: [interrupting]What does your brother do?

00:09:58.472 --> 00:10:02.538
Nathan Finkel: My brother is also here at the university [unintelligible] [on the second?]...

00:10:02.538 --> 00:10:04.011
David Boder: [interrupting] Ah, what are you studying?

00:10:04.011 --> 00:10:05.659
Nathan Finkel: I am studying architecture.

00:10:05.659 --> 00:10:13.966
David Boder: So...okay...That means your brother [unintelligible] [you went after?]?

00:10:13.966 --> 00:10:18.261
Nathan Finkel: To be involved.

00:10:18.261 --> 00:10:23.267
David Boder: So...Well, and how are [these?] conditions at the university, you, ah, what...

00:10:23.267 --> 00:10:50.420
Nathan Finkel: Conditions at the university are not so very good, now [unintelligible], but earlier it wasn’t so good [with the food?]. What touches on the lessons, that’s the main thing. We have a total of about seventy students in architecture. Only several professors are good, the rest do not [teach us very much?] to the exclusion of several.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.409
David Boder: And how is the relationship between the students?

00:10:53.409 --> 00:11:02.492
Nathan Finkel: The relationship is rather correct between the students. Although I am a Jew, [and I feel?]

00:11:02.492 --> 00:11:04.907
David Boder: [unintelligible].

00:11:04.907 --> 00:11:15.939
Nathan Finkel: And I feel that here are very many of my worst ah, enemies, very [inspired?] enemies, well, nonetheless, I never feel it.

00:11:15.939 --> 00:11:17.490
David Boder: You how? Do you feel it or not feel it?

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:25.410
Nathan Finkel: I feel it because I know that they [unintelligible], nor this [they do not show?] relationship toward me. [Outwardly?] it isn’t seen.

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:28.317
David Boder: So...Perhaps this is just your suspiciousness?

00:11:28.317 --> 00:11:39.016
Nathan Finkel: It is...Maybe all my suspiciousness, but since I know that there are Ukrainians here, that there are Lithuanians here. They were our killers, because the Germans didn’t kill us, but only the Ukrainians and the Lithuanians, and all.

00:11:39.016 --> 00:11:43.342
David Boder: But the Lithuanians are also refugees?

00:11:43.342 --> 00:11:47.297
Nathan Finkel: Not all of them are refugees.

00:11:47.297 --> 00:11:49.799
David Boder: Well, I understand...go on.

00:11:49.799 --> 00:11:54.080
David Boder: Well, and what do you expect from this university? Don you have any relatives in America?

00:11:54.080 --> 00:12:07.370
Nathan Finkel: I have relatives, but I know very little about them. And how [corrects himself] I still haven’t gotten in touch with them. I think being involved, for the time being the conditions are better here than [those somewhere in the country?], so I want to study here.

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:10.099
David Boder: Aha, and why won’t you go [to a local?] university?

00:12:10.099 --> 00:12:11.572
Nathan Finkel: I am dealing with that now.

00:12:11.572 --> 00:12:12.393
David Boder: Which one?

00:12:12.393 --> 00:12:15.147
Nathan Finkel: With the Germans [now Munich?] after the second semester.

00:12:15.147 --> 00:12:16.007
David Boder: In architecture?

00:12:16.007 --> 00:12:16.749
Nathan Finkel: In architecture, yes.

00:12:16.749 --> 00:12:18.519
David Boder: And who will pay this for you?

00:12:18.519 --> 00:12:20.835
Nathan Finkel: [We?] have been exempted [of payment for us?]

00:12:20.835 --> 00:12:21.102
David Boder: And...

00:12:21.102 --> 00:12:24.187
Nathan Finkel: [interrupting] All Jewish students [are exempt from?] payment.

00:12:24.187 --> 00:12:25.364
David Boder: Who exempted you from it?

00:12:25.364 --> 00:12:29.401
Nathan Finkel: Our student alliance that is here exempted us.

00:12:29.401 --> 00:12:30.874
David Boder: [This alliance?] is Jewish?

00:12:30.874 --> 00:12:46.075
Nathan Finkel: It is a special Jewish alliance located here of two hundred and ten Jewish students. Earlier almost everyone was here at the UNRRA University. Now the majority [will transfer?] to a German university. Since oneself and the conditions at [stops], the conditions are better.

00:12:46.075 --> 00:12:48.058
David Boder: So.

00:12:48.058 --> 00:12:51.725
Nathan Finkel: Not all the devices are needed here because this university [is forming the rest here?]...

00:12:51.725 --> 00:12:52.180
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:57.126
Nathan Finkel: . . . they will swap. And there already [everyone?] for the local professors [firstly is better?]

00:12:57.126 --> 00:12:57.445
David Boder: So.

00:12:57.445 --> 00:13:03.330
Nathan Finkel: On the other hand, there [unintelligible] [to study?] since we [are located in contact?] the Germans.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:09.372
David Boder: And do you think that the German students are just as bad as they were during Hitler’s time?

00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:18.342
Nathan Finkel: They have been left nonetheless [these sour things?] , because [they?] clearly don’t address it, but it is felt their [unintelligible].

00:13:18.342 --> 00:13:22.147
David Boder: [Who?] expresses [this?]? Perhaps you are simply suspicious people.

00:13:22.147 --> 00:13:32.642
Nathan Finkel: It is expressed [in the fact?] that very often it is even noted as one indicates to the other that there are too many [living?] Jews here.

00:13:32.642 --> 00:13:38.281
David Boder: And by the way, this exemption from payment that the [student alliance?] to pay or the Germans exempted the payment?

00:13:38.281 --> 00:13:40.801
Nathan Finkel: The Germans, the Bavarian government...

00:13:40.801 --> 00:13:41.339
David Boder: So.

00:13:41.339 --> 00:13:45.891
Nathan Finkel: . . . it exempted us. It is [unintelligible] [Bundes-?] minister exempted...

00:13:45.891 --> 00:13:49.121
David Boder: [interrupting] And the Ukrainians have not been exempted from payment?

00:13:49.121 --> 00:13:51.375
Nathan Finkel: Not all. [Not how?] we [unintelligible].

00:13:51.375 --> 00:13:52.643
David Boder: Or the Poles?

00:13:52.643 --> 00:13:56.077
Nathan Finkel: Also [they, but not all?], but the Jewish exempted.
