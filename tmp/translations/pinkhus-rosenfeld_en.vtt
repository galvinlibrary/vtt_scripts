00:01:32.144 --> 00:01:35.132
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Pinkhus Rosenfeld, born in Lodz.

00:01:35.132 --> 00:01:36.630
David Boder: How old are you, Mr. Rosenfeld?

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.040
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: On the second [day] of the first [month, January], 1903.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.785
David Boder: Then you are now forty-three years old, isn’t that so?

00:01:41.785 --> 00:01:42.463
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes.

00:01:42.463 --> 00:01:46.910
David Boder: And so tell me, you are living in Paris now?

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.229
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: I have been living in Paris now for three weeks.

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.217
David Boder: Aha, and what are you doing there?

00:01:52.217 --> 00:01:58.275
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: What...I am looking for possibilities of going to Palestine where I have my own home...

00:01:58.275 --> 00:01:58.618
David Boder: Yes.

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:00.876
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . and also a house that my father has there.

00:02:00.876 --> 00:02:01.888
David Boder: Yes?

00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:07.915
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And, alas, I cannot go there. I am [words not clear]. I am navanat...

00:02:07.915 --> 00:02:08.836
David Boder: Hm.

00:02:08.836 --> 00:02:09.939
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . all the time.

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:15.358
David Boder: And...and what beziehung [connection] do you have here with this kibbutz in Hénonville?

00:02:15.358 --> 00:02:16.613
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: What does beziehung mean?

00:02:16.613 --> 00:02:19.175
David Boder: I mean, I see you here, you are here.

00:02:19.175 --> 00:02:22.862
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: I have here two children who were also with me all the time.

00:02:22.862 --> 00:02:23.713
David Boder: Aha.

00:02:23.713 --> 00:02:29.853
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: I am not able to maintain them in Paris. I cannot afford to live in Paris, so that...

00:02:29.853 --> 00:02:30.440
David Boder: Hm.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.787
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . I have placed them in the kibbutz, and they have a very happy life.

00:02:31.787 --> 00:02:34.380
David Boder: And your wife is where?

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.368
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: My wife, alas, perished in Auschwitz.

00:02:37.368 --> 00:02:40.633
David Boder: Hm. So who looks after the children here?

00:02:40.633 --> 00:02:42.061
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: They themselves.

00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:42.374
David Boder: What?

00:02:42.374 --> 00:02:43.019
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Themselves. They are...

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:43.272
David Boder: How old are they?

00:02:43.272 --> 00:02:44.338
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . grown up children.

00:02:44.338 --> 00:02:44.772
David Boder: Oh.

00:02:44.772 --> 00:02:45.748
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Nineteen and twenty-one years.

00:02:45.748 --> 00:02:47.477
David Boder: What are they, boys, girls?

00:02:47.477 --> 00:02:48.814
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Two boys. Two...

00:02:48.814 --> 00:02:49.007
David Boder: Two...

00:02:49.007 --> 00:02:52.634
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: I had girls. They perished in the Warsaw Ghetto.

00:02:52.634 --> 00:02:53.851
David Boder: In the Warsaw Ghetto.

00:02:53.851 --> 00:02:55.008
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes. [Words not clear.]

00:02:55.008 --> 00:03:10.575
David Boder: And so, Mr. Rosenfeld, will you please tell me where you were when the war started and the main events that happened to you? Take your time. You can talk as much as you want. Go on.

00:03:10.575 --> 00:03:14.051
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: [When] the war started, I was in Lodz.

00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:17.075
David Boder: Hm.

00:03:17.075 --> 00:03:23.864
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And then it happened. On the night of the 5th and 6th of September...

00:03:23.864 --> 00:03:24.840
David Boder: Yes?

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.412
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . we were running.

00:03:27.412 --> 00:03:28.779
David Boder: Why were people running?

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:56.077
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Because we had heard that the German is arriving, and the fear immediately brought great panic [?] so that at once we were running. We did not know where, what, or when. We did not take under consideration that the German army with its mechanization, with all its technique, that it will run faster than we, but the fear moved us to run. Thus, we are running until today. It is already seven years. Today is exactly seven years since the war started, and we are still running.

00:03:56.077 --> 00:04:03.860
David Boder: And so, Mr. Rosenfeld, give it to me one thing at a time, in details. Where did you go from Lodz? What was your occupation in Lodz?

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.661
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: In Lodz I was a textile manufacturer. We had our own factory in Zdunska Wola.

00:04:08.661 --> 00:04:19.516
David Boder: Aha. Tell me...[you had] a textile business. Did you know the Sigmunds [mispronounced Sigman] in Lodz, from Chicago? They had a big textile factory. [Pause.] Sigmund [Sigman].

00:04:19.516 --> 00:04:21.787
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Sigmund in the texti-...no.

00:04:21.787 --> 00:04:26.498
David Boder: No, and so, nu, you had what sort of business, a factory?

00:04:26.498 --> 00:04:27.534
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: We had a factory.

00:04:27.534 --> 00:04:28.600
David Boder: Who is the we?

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.504
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Rosenfeld and Patovski was [the name of] the firm.

00:04:31.504 --> 00:04:32.932
David Boder: Aha.

00:04:32.932 --> 00:04:34.691
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And we had the factory...

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:39.281
David Boder: Is it not the Patovski of whom one is in New York?

00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:41.673
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: I would not know.

00:04:41.673 --> 00:04:48.884
David Boder: You would not know. And so, go on. [Pause.] Now, where did you run? What did you take along?

00:04:48.884 --> 00:05:01.878
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: We took along a little money in the pocket. The rest we left, everything unguarded, and we ran. Finally we saw on the road that the Germans have come ahead of us.

00:05:01.878 --> 00:05:03.667
David Boder: Nu?

00:05:03.667 --> 00:05:13.016
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And we began to reflect that our running was totally useless, so we turned around and we came back to Lodz.

00:05:13.016 --> 00:05:13.962
David Boder: Back to Lodz?

00:05:13.962 --> 00:05:15.631
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Back to Lodz.

00:05:15.631 --> 00:05:17.932
David Boder: Yes, nu?

00:05:17.932 --> 00:05:26.438
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Nu, naturally in Lodz we were already met at certain points by the Germans, and the local folk-Germans [Poles who claimed German ancestry]...

00:05:26.438 --> 00:05:26.932
David Boder: Hm.

00:05:26.932 --> 00:05:37.245
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . the so-called Poles, and we were at once cleaned up. They took away everything we had, the little money. Now we were already completely without anything.

00:05:37.245 --> 00:05:40.058
David Boder: Hm.

00:05:40.058 --> 00:05:46.546
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Afterwards happened the story that Lodz was incorporated by the German into the Reich.

00:05:46.546 --> 00:05:48.998
David Boder: Oh.

00:05:48.998 --> 00:00:00.000
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And there began to happen all the calamaties, with dragging for labor and with going to work, and the summons to the Gestapo, so that my father, as an elderly man, decided that he will leave Lodz. Where should he go? There is no where or what or when, but still, seeing that Warsaw was [made a] protectorate at that time, there began an exodus [to Warsaw]. It was assumed that being a protectorate, it will have some sort of independence, there he will have, so to speak, some kind of a chance.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: Yes?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:07:10.041
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: There it will be possible to save ourselves. So that by father and my mother and a brother...and I also sent along my two children there, and we journeyed to Warsaw. I myself had also gone a couple of weeks before to Warsaw. Upon so, seeing that in Warsaw there is no chance of living, the money is coming to an end, and in Lodz we still had buried a little Polish money, we went back to Lodz to save...

00:07:10.041 --> 00:07:10.776
David Boder: The whole family?

00:07:10.776 --> 00:07:12.927
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: No, I and the mother.

00:07:12.927 --> 00:07:13.632
David Boder: Hm.

00:07:13.632 --> 00:07:17.168
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: In order to take out the money and get back to Warsaw.

00:07:17.168 --> 00:07:22.873
David Boder: What sort of money was it, gold, silver, paper money, Polish money?

00:07:22.873 --> 00:07:24.361
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: We had all sorts of currency...

00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:25.367
David Boder: Aha.

00:07:25.367 --> 00:07:30.108
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . buried for the time in the Ghetto.

00:07:30.108 --> 00:07:31.867
David Boder: Yes?

00:07:31.867 --> 00:07:42.240
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And so, returning, we came back before Pesach, the first Pesach that the German was in Lodz, and we have...

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.240
David Boder: Was there already a ghetto?

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.222
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes, there was already established a ghetto, already with all the trappings.

00:07:49.222 --> 00:07:49.897
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:49.897 --> 00:07:58.704
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And on the thirtieth [day] of the fourth [month] the ghetto was to be closed, and we tried about five days before Pesach to get out.

00:07:58.704 --> 00:08:00.343
David Boder: From the ghetto.

00:08:00.343 --> 00:08:05.837
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: From the ghetto. People were then still smuggling across the Beth Hechaim at night.

00:08:05.837 --> 00:08:07.717
David Boder: Beth Hechaim is the cemetery?

00:08:07.717 --> 00:08:08.211
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes.

00:08:08.211 --> 00:08:10.663
David Boder: Yes?

00:08:10.663 --> 00:08:10.663
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And we did not succeed. We were shot after a few times. We did not succeed. I had sent before yet to Warsaw my two girls. The two boys had remained in Lodz.

00:08:10.663 --> 00:08:27.223
David Boder: And your wife?

00:08:27.223 --> 00:08:29.193
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: My wife had also remained.

00:08:29.193 --> 00:08:30.350
David Boder: In Warsaw?

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:31.296
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: In Lo-...in Lodz.

00:08:31.296 --> 00:08:31.760
David Boder: Yes.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:44.573
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: She did not go along then. And my mother had also returned with me to Warsaw. During this time the situation in Warsaw became very bad. I am telling it very briefly, as the saying goes, if not...

00:08:44.573 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: Yes.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:08:52.446
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . it would not suffice to write up a whole room of papers. If one would sit for years it would not suffice, but I am making [it] very brief.

00:08:52.446 --> 00:08:52.970
David Boder: Nu?

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:59.247
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: During that time my father had passed away in Warsaw.

00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:01.940
David Boder: Just by himself [from natural causes]?

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:07.464
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Just by himself. He got sick. His blood was sick.

00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:08.560
David Boder: Hm. Was he an old man?

00:09:08.560 --> 00:00:00.000
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: He was sixty-two years old.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: Hm.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:09:10.560
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: In general, since he had possessions in Eretz Yisroeil [Land of Israel] and having decided that any day...if the war had broken out four weeks later...

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.626
David Boder: Hm.

00:09:11.626 --> 00:09:36.575
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . he would have already been in Eretz Yisroeil, and now having seen that he had no chance for it, he cannot get over, this brought him his sickness. His blood became bad, and he died.

00:09:36.575 --> 00:09:37.099
David Boder: Nu?

00:09:37.099 --> 00:10:01.694
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: The rest of my family later took pains, through various tricks, having given away the last...they brought the mother out to Warsaw. And during the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto I lost all my family, my mother, my two children.

00:10:01.694 --> 00:10:02.971
David Boder: Which ghetto, the Warsaw Ghetto?

00:10:02.971 --> 00:10:04.067
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: The Warsaw Ghetto, yes.

00:10:04.067 --> 00:10:05.103
David Boder: Yes?

00:10:05.103 --> 00:10:14.211
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Whether they perished in the ghetto or they were sent to Majdanek, Treblinka I do not know. I know only one thing, that they are no more.

00:10:14.211 --> 00:10:15.338
David Boder: Who, your mother?

00:10:15.338 --> 00:00:00.000
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: My mother, my two chil-...children, my two brothers, a sister-in-law of mine with two children, and my sister with two children.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:10:35.637
David Boder: Where were the other two children...of yours? You had four children.

00:10:35.637 --> 00:10:39.685
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Two were in Warsaw. Two I had send. They had come along right with me.

00:10:39.685 --> 00:10:40.089
David Boder: Aha.

00:10:40.089 --> 00:10:44.107
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And after, when I was supposed to have come to save ourselves from the last catastrophe in Warsaw...

00:10:44.107 --> 00:10:44.782
David Boder: Yes, so you have...yes?

00:10:44.782 --> 00:10:48.409
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . I left the two girls there.

00:10:48.409 --> 00:10:48.752
David Boder: Yes.

00:10:48.752 --> 00:10:51.927
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And with the two boys whom I had not taken there yet, we remained until [words not clear].

00:10:51.927 --> 00:10:54.228
David Boder: Oh, the two boys were in Lodz and have remained...

00:10:54.228 --> 00:10:54.933
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Have remained in Lodz.

00:10:54.933 --> 00:10:56.331
David Boder: Aha. Nu, and so?

00:10:56.331 --> 00:11:02.819
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And so in Lodz we got then into the ghetto.

00:11:02.819 --> 00:11:09.066
David Boder: Where did you live in Lodz before? Was your house where the ghetto was later made, or not?

00:11:09.066 --> 00:11:16.909
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: No, it was not inside the ghetto. Where I had lived was Polodniowa 25, and the father had lived on Ceglana number 14.

00:11:16.909 --> 00:11:17.614
David Boder: Yes?

00:11:17.614 --> 00:11:43.708
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Then we were quartered in the ghetto, not quartered, but we heard...the German thought that the Jews were moving somehow too slowly. He wanted that it should go with more tempo, and they simply attacked the streets and the houses and shot out everybody in the neighboring [non-ghetto] streets. Then we did not wait any more for the plan...we did not wait for the plan any more which was supposed to be that we go according to a plan, everyday should go a certain street. But afterwards we just ran by ourselves into the ghetto.

00:11:43.708 --> 00:11:45.106
David Boder: And where did you live there?

00:11:45.106 --> 00:11:53.913
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: In the ghetto we were pushed into...we were twenty-odd people in a room which was about, let us say, four meters by four meters.

00:11:53.913 --> 00:11:56.666
David Boder: Nu?

00:11:56.666 --> 00:12:25.440
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Nu, in the ghetto later, as it is already known from the descriptions of the ghetto, was created some sort of self-government with [its] own currency with some sort of self-sufficiency, that we were working for the Germans in all the shops and in every trade. And for that the Germans sent in for us the most meager [?], that means the minium, food supplies and certain rations. On that we lived in the ghetto.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.163
David Boder: Who was the Elder of the ghetto there?

00:12:28.163 --> 00:12:31.699
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: The Elder of the Jews was Mordechai Chaim Rumkowski.

00:12:31.699 --> 00:12:32.554
David Boder: Rumkowski.

00:12:32.554 --> 00:12:32.988
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes.

00:12:32.988 --> 00:12:34.115
David Boder: Nu?

00:12:34.115 --> 00:12:37.531
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: He was the Elder of the Jews.

00:12:37.531 --> 00:12:45.013
David Boder: What had he been before? What sort of a man was he? What was his status before in Lodz? Did people know him there?

00:12:45.013 --> 00:12:50.176
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: In Lodz he was known. The man was a Jewish community worker.

00:12:50.176 --> 00:12:50.640
David Boder: A what?

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.459
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: A community worker.

00:12:52.459 --> 00:12:53.865
David Boder: Worker, yes.

00:12:53.865 --> 00:13:12.600
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes. One of the...I can say, alas with regret, also a Zionist worker. He took part in the Zionist Congresses. A man who was childless. A man who had done much for orphans. He had founded an orphanage together with the greatest citizens. He got together money and erected...

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.674
David Boder: Before [the advent of the Germans]?

00:13:13.674 --> 00:13:14.990
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Before, naturally.

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:16.185
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:16.185 --> 00:13:28.319
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And because he...and because he was...at the time when the German marched in to Lodz, he was one of the Jewish civic leaders, that means, of the Community Council officials.

00:13:28.319 --> 00:13:28.679
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:28.679 --> 00:13:40.513
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And he...because of his patriarchal appearance he [the Germans] made him remain. The rest, all the civic leaders, he sent away to Dachau where they perished. And in this way he took over the complete leadership.

00:13:40.513 --> 00:13:42.433
David Boder: Who sent away the people to Dachau?

00:13:42.433 --> 00:13:43.357
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: The Germans.

00:13:43.357 --> 00:13:43.918
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:43.918 --> 00:13:48.765
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And he alone remained out of the fifty...eh...

00:13:48.765 --> 00:13:49.779
David Boder: From the Community Council.

00:13:49.779 --> 00:13:50.612
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: From the Community Council...

00:13:50.612 --> 00:13:51.354
David Boder: He alone [?]?

00:13:51.354 --> 00:13:52.821
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . he remained.

00:13:52.821 --> 00:14:31.112
David Boder: [In English] This concludes Spool 130 with Mr. Pinkhus Rosenfeld reporting, and we are going over to Spool 131. Hénonville, fifty kilometers from Paris, in a home of displaced Jews which is occupied by a Kibbutz and a migrating, so to speak, Yeshiva from Lithuania. September 13, 1946. Hénonville. Illinois Institute of Technology recording.

00:14:31.112 --> 00:15:04.382
David Boder: France, September the 13th, 1946. At Hénonville, fifty kilometers from Paris. In a chateau, Hénonville, which is occupied by displaced people. An organization of Orthodox Jews, Hassidim [a sect], a Kibbutz, and a Yeshiva. The interviewee is Mr. Pinkhus Rosenfeld, from Lodz. We have started the [recording]...on Spool 130 at twenty minutes and we are continuing now.

00:15:04.382 --> 00:15:16.913
David Boder: [In Yiddish] And so, Mr. Rosenfeld, where were we? You were relating about Lodz. And so you had returned and...

00:15:16.913 --> 00:15:19.436
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And I remained in the Lodz
                        ghetto.

00:15:19.436 --> 00:15:22.502
David Boder: Yes?

00:15:22.502 --> 00:15:28.496
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Now, is not the place to relate all the experiences that we have lived through.

00:15:28.496 --> 00:15:39.379
David Boder: But do take some typical incidents which had happened to you and your family, not in general. [Pause.] Did you build a bunker? [Here reference is made not to air-raid shelters, but to hide-outs against raids for deportation.]

00:15:39.379 --> 00:15:40.303
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: No.

00:15:40.303 --> 00:15:47.595
David Boder: Why not?

00:15:47.595 --> 00:16:00.893
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Because as a rule it did not happen that people in the ghetto built bunkers. Perhaps in the last moments when the time was already very short. Our street they started to take among the first, so that we were not able to do it.

00:16:00.893 --> 00:16:12.135
David Boder: Hm. Nu, and so what happened then? You say that people began working for the Germans. What did you do?

00:16:12.135 --> 00:16:24.286
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: I was accidently, the head of a point for provision supply which served a certain area...

00:16:24.286 --> 00:16:25.904
David Boder: Yes.

00:16:25.904 --> 00:16:31.747
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . with...with provisions which were rationed, which were issued every two weeks.

00:16:31.747 --> 00:16:32.761
David Boder: Yes.

00:16:32.761 --> 00:16:45.214
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: It is altogether [?] unbelievable that when the rations were issued for two weeks it included a ration which consisted of three dekas of turnips for two weeks.

00:16:45.214 --> 00:16:46.439
David Boder: Three what?

00:16:46.439 --> 00:16:51.497
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Three dekas...thirty grams of turnips.

00:16:51.497 --> 00:16:52.722
David Boder: Turnips.

00:16:52.722 --> 00:16:53.344
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Turnips.

00:16:53.344 --> 00:16:55.535
David Boder: Thirty grams of turnips for two weeks.

00:16:55.535 --> 00:16:56.187
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: For two weeks. I won’t...

00:16:56.187 --> 00:16:59.676
David Boder: And what else? How much bread?

00:16:59.676 --> 00:17:03.829
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Bread was given, two kilos for eight days.

00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:07.348
David Boder: Two kilos. Nu.

00:17:07.348 --> 00:17:12.769
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: That was it. There was another little, what else...

00:17:12.769 --> 00:17:14.115
David Boder: Butter?

00:17:14.115 --> 00:17:16.699
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Nothing whatsoever. No fats were given.

00:17:16.699 --> 00:17:25.077
David Boder: Hm. Go on. And you were working where the rations were issued.

00:17:25.077 --> 00:17:27.208
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: I was working where the rations were issued.

00:17:27.208 --> 00:17:29.128
David Boder: Yes?

00:17:29.128 --> 00:17:45.836
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: So that I must say [admit] that this [stroke of] luck brought me [the chance] that I had somehow a little...that I could eat something watching at night in the store somehow...that it was possible to eat something.

00:17:45.836 --> 00:17:46.096
David Boder: Hm.

00:17:46.096 --> 00:17:49.132
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: That gave me the possibilities to live through.

00:17:49.132 --> 00:17:56.243
David Boder: Yes? [Pause.] Nu?

00:17:56.243 --> 00:18:21.163
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And so thus we went on suffering. Four years we were in the ghetto, no clothing, no heating, and wearing wooden shoes. We were [there] until the end of August. The children were working very hard.

00:18:21.163 --> 00:18:22.569
David Boder: How old were the children?

00:18:22.569 --> 00:18:28.140
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: The children were then about...when they got in the ghetto one was thirteen and one was in the fifteenth year.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:32.021
David Boder: Aha. And such [children] the Germans already considered as workers?

00:18:32.021 --> 00:18:48.307
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Such...and how...such the Germans considered workers already. To the contrary this was fortunate. In the beginning there was the slogan [the belief]. Seeing that whoever will work will not be deported, and we already knew the odor of the deportation, so that even eight year old children were sent [by the parents?] to work.

00:18:48.307 --> 00:18:48.597
David Boder: Hm.

00:18:48.597 --> 00:18:54.350
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: I can say that my children who weighed as much as about sixty kilos when they came in the ghetto...

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:57.096
David Boder: Hm.

00:18:57.096 --> 00:19:09.500
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Later when they were four years older—these are the best years in which a child must have the most nourishment and to gain most strength —they still lost fifteen kilos each.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:10.574
David Boder: When, in the ghetto?

00:19:10.574 --> 00:19:11.377
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: In the ghetto.

00:19:11.377 --> 00:19:12.421
David Boder: Aha, nu?

00:19:12.421 --> 00:19:27.349
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Still as youngsters. Before the war I weighed 96 kilos, and then, in the last days of the ghetto, I weighed 62 kilos. We had virtually become skeletons.

00:19:27.349 --> 00:19:29.993
David Boder: Hm.

00:19:29.993 --> 00:19:32.727
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: [Pause.] Nu, is there anything else you would like to ask me about ghetto life?

00:19:32.727 --> 00:19:33.560
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:33.789
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: For instance?

00:19:33.789 --> 00:19:41.383
David Boder: And so, I would like to know...And what did you do during the entire four years? Did you work in the administration during the entire four years?

00:19:41.383 --> 00:19:45.747
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: In the administration of the...of the supply point.

00:19:45.747 --> 00:19:46.339
David Boder: Aha.

00:19:46.339 --> 00:19:46.931
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: I worked there.

00:19:46.931 --> 00:19:49.816
David Boder: Did that help you so that you were not sent away from Lodz?

00:19:49.816 --> 00:19:52.943
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: That helped me so that I was not sent away.

00:19:52.943 --> 00:19:54.229
David Boder: And you were left to remain with your children.

00:19:54.229 --> 00:19:55.183
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes.

00:19:55.183 --> 00:20:07.577
David Boder: Nu, and then how was the ghetto gradually reduced? How did it come to the end? Describe to me, let us say, the last six months of the ghetto.

00:20:07.577 --> 00:20:33.932
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: When the Germans saw that the Russians were approaching and they were not far from Warsaw, Warsaw from Lodz being, so to speak, only about one hundred twenty kilometers, they began step by step to liquidate the ghetto. And so, first of all...[pause]...

00:20:33.932 --> 00:20:36.184
David Boder: Yes?

00:20:36.184 --> 00:20:44.924
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . were sent out those who had at one time sinned [against the Germans]. What does it mean had sinned? There being no fuel, I am only pointing at an...

00:20:44.924 --> 00:20:45.395
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:45.395 --> 00:20:45.896
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . example.

00:20:45.896 --> 00:20:46.246
David Boder: Yes?

00:20:46.246 --> 00:21:00.147
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: If one had stolen once a piece of wood from an old fence, or if a cart with potatoes passed on the street and a child of five years ran after it and grabbed a raw potato...

00:21:00.147 --> 00:21:01.010
David Boder: Hm.

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:09.630
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . this constituted already one of the worst crimes, for which they were in the first line, and these were sent away.

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:12.515
David Boder: What does it mean? The parents of the child, or what?

00:21:12.515 --> 00:21:14.585
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: The parents together with the whole family were sent away.

00:21:14.585 --> 00:21:15.177
David Boder: Hm.

00:21:15.177 --> 00:21:17.127
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Then for the German there were...

00:21:17.127 --> 00:21:21.370
David Boder: Nu, who, for instance, reported it, that a child grabbed a potato?

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:27.666
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: For that there were, alas, Jewish police who also had to cling to life...

00:21:27.666 --> 00:21:28.288
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:28.288 --> 00:21:31.988
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . who [the police] had also been appointed by the Germans, who [the police] watched over that.

00:21:31.988 --> 00:21:33.696
David Boder: Aha.

00:21:33.696 --> 00:21:36.461
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: If,, by chance, he [the Jewish policeman] would let pass such a thing...

00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:36.932
David Boder: Hm.

00:21:36.932 --> 00:21:40.964
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . if he would have kept silent about it, he would be—there were at once over them such watchmen —

00:21:40.964 --> 00:21:41.857
David Boder: Hm.

00:21:41.857 --> 00:21:43.686
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . if not, they would all be deported.

00:21:43.686 --> 00:21:44.730
David Boder: Aha. So who made the list for the deportation?

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:48.159
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: At first the police made it.

00:21:48.159 --> 00:21:51.195
David Boder: The Jewish police.

00:21:51.195 --> 00:21:52.933
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: The Jewish police.

00:21:52.933 --> 00:21:53.525
David Boder: Nu?

00:21:53.525 --> 00:22:00.364
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Nu, and so, the so-called criminals having been already sent away, they took and sent away single people. That means...

00:22:00.364 --> 00:22:01.257
David Boder: What does it mean, single people?

00:22:01.257 --> 00:22:07.311
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Such people who had come from the provinces and had already been previously deported. They had already taken away their wives and their children.

00:22:07.311 --> 00:22:07.752
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:07.752 --> 00:22:09.853
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: So these single people were sent away.

00:22:09.853 --> 00:22:10.263
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:10.263 --> 00:22:13.963
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Because we [?] saw, as far as possible, that whole families should remain.

00:22:13.963 --> 00:22:14.766
David Boder: Oh.

00:22:14.766 --> 00:22:23.341
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Then, when this was already finished, they took people...there came out a decree to hand over all the children.

00:22:23.341 --> 00:22:31.538
David Boder: Yes, tell me about this case, about the children. How did it happen, and what role did Rumkowski play in it?

00:22:31.538 --> 00:22:37.049
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: The Germans said to hand over all the children up to the age of twelve.

00:22:37.049 --> 00:22:37.731
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:37.731 --> 00:22:44.208
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: To deliver them to a certain point, and they will be brought to Germany.

00:22:44.208 --> 00:22:45.826
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:45.826 --> 00:22:49.979
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: There they will be raised and fed.

00:22:49.979 --> 00:22:52.925
David Boder: Aha. Children. How small? From six months?

00:22:52.925 --> 00:23:01.877
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: No difference how old it was. From a day to twelve years. All these children had to be reported, and all of them had to be handed over for sending to Germany.

00:23:01.877 --> 00:23:05.004
David Boder: Aha.

00:23:05.004 --> 00:23:16.793
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Exceptions were made at that time for the Jewish police and for such so-called elite, those who were then in the service of Rumkowski’s kingdom.

00:23:16.793 --> 00:23:17.596
David Boder: Hm.

00:23:17.596 --> 00:23:35.693
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: So that one can say that there were sent away...eighteen thousand children [this number varies in different interviews] were sent away. This took place in the space of time from the 5th of September to the 12th of September, 1942 [?], and two thousand children...

00:23:35.693 --> 00:23:37.824
David Boder: From September the what? The 1st?

00:23:37.824 --> 00:23:39.170
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: From the 5th of September until...

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:40.275
David Boder: From the 5th until the 12th.

00:23:40.275 --> 00:23:41.017
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . the 12th.

00:23:41.017 --> 00:23:41.759
David Boder: One week.

00:23:41.759 --> 00:23:42.230
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: One week.

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:44.089
David Boder: Yes?

00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:49.117
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: The police went around grabbing, and the entire ghetto was locked up, and a blockade was installed.

00:23:49.117 --> 00:23:49.739
David Boder: Yes?

00:23:49.739 --> 00:23:58.057
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And nobody could go out, but they went around simply from house to house and all the children were taken out.

00:23:58.057 --> 00:23:59.977
David Boder: And where were they assembled?

00:23:59.977 --> 00:24:02.198
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: They were assembled on certain assembly points.

00:24:02.198 --> 00:24:03.091
David Boder: Did you see it?

00:24:03.091 --> 00:24:04.286
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes, indeed.

00:24:04.286 --> 00:24:04.878
David Boder: Yes.

00:24:04.878 --> 00:24:09.816
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Not only I, but thousands of people saw it, and then they were sent away.

00:24:09.816 --> 00:24:11.404
David Boder: How, in railroad cars?

00:24:11.404 --> 00:24:12.267
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: On trucks they were sent away.

00:24:12.267 --> 00:24:13.341
David Boder: In automobiles.

00:24:13.341 --> 00:24:16.588
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: We saw no trains, but saw them being sent away on trucks.

00:24:16.588 --> 00:24:21.978
David Boder: Now, where were they sent to?

00:24:21.978 --> 00:24:23.294
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Nu, there where all the Jews were sent.

00:24:23.294 --> 00:24:37.252
David Boder: No, no, no. [Words not clear.] This we have to have very clearly. Where were they sent to? Did people know...did anyone find out? Were they sent to Auschwitz? Were they sent to Majdanek? Where were they sent to?

00:24:37.252 --> 00:24:40.499
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: All the time we did not know where they were sent.

00:24:40.499 --> 00:24:50.085
David Boder: And so let us try to give the German, so to speak, every consideration.

00:24:50.085 --> 00:24:51.039
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes.

00:24:51.039 --> 00:24:56.067
David Boder: Let us say this. When children were taken, it was said they will be sent to [better] nourished?

00:24:56.067 --> 00:24:56.809
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes.

00:24:56.809 --> 00:24:59.845
David Boder: Did they make out a list? Did they write down their names?

00:24:59.845 --> 00:25:10.789
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Nothing at all. If there were still such optimists, especially among us who were still in the ghetto, who then did not know so much about Auschwitz, Majdanek and Treblinka...

00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:11.713
David Boder: Yes?

00:25:11.713 --> 00:25:25.162
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . we did think somehow that the children would perhaps be taken to Germany. It went under the pretext that the parents should be able to work. In order that they not be burdened with raising of children...

00:25:25.162 --> 00:25:25.693
David Boder: Hm.

00:25:25.693 --> 00:25:32.441
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . the children were taken away. Although it could have been arranged in the ghetto as well but we...we wanted to fool ourselves.

00:25:32.441 --> 00:25:32.912
David Boder: Aha. Tell me, were there...

00:25:32.912 --> 00:25:34.409
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: In closing, we had no choice.

00:25:34.409 --> 00:25:38.351
David Boder: . . . any placards, any announcements to bring the children? What...

00:25:38.351 --> 00:25:42.926
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: No. Rumkowski put out placards to come and assemble...

00:25:42.926 --> 00:25:44.121
David Boder: Yes.

00:25:44.121 --> 00:25:52.650
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . on the so-called square. It was once called...on the Goscinny Dwor [a market square usually surrounded by buildings containing stores].

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:54.992
David Boder: Oh. Goscinny Dwor, yes. Nu?

00:25:54.992 --> 00:25:56.217
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Outside.

00:25:56.217 --> 00:25:57.895
David Boder: Were the stores around?

00:25:57.895 --> 00:25:58.728
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes.

00:25:58.728 --> 00:25:58.957
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:25:58.957 --> 00:26:04.196
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And we already could fe-...feel that the air is somehow not clean, another edict against the Jews is coming.

00:26:04.196 --> 00:26:04.878
David Boder: Nu?

00:26:04.878 --> 00:26:15.520
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And so there Rumkowski came out seemingly with such a broken spirit. How much truth there lay in it we did not know, because we already knew that he has sold out to the Germans...

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:16.413
David Boder: Nu?

00:26:16.413 --> 00:26:26.481
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . because of the career [position] he was seeking. But it is not believable that he did want [covet] so much, that he did not foresee that he will have to serve the Germans with so much. But now he already had to.

00:26:26.481 --> 00:26:26.861
David Boder: Hm.

00:26:26.861 --> 00:26:34.286
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And so he issued the order for it to be known that all the children must be handed over.

00:26:34.286 --> 00:26:36.930
David Boder: Did you hear his speech?

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:37.884
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes.

00:26:37.884 --> 00:26:41.373
David Boder: Do you remember anything of it? [This speech was mentioned in other interviews, hence the question.]

00:26:41.373 --> 00:26:47.639
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: I remember that he gave us to understand that we must save ourselves, and that it is a decree...

00:26:47.639 --> 00:26:48.774
David Boder: Save yourselves.

00:26:48.774 --> 00:26:52.384
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Save ourselves, and with that, that we will hand over the small children,...

00:26:52.384 --> 00:26:53.308
David Boder: Yes?

00:26:53.308 --> 00:26:55.318
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . with that we will be saved.

00:26:55.318 --> 00:27:02.278
David Boder: Did he use the expression ‘Mothers, bring your burned offering’?

00:27:02.278 --> 00:27:04.318
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: [After a pause, animated by the recollection] Yes.

00:27:04.318 --> 00:27:05.211
David Boder: You heard that?

00:27:05.211 --> 00:27:05.712
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes.

00:27:05.712 --> 00:27:09.171
David Boder: ‘Mothers, bring your burned offerings,’ yes?

00:27:09.171 --> 00:27:11.905
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: ‘It is to be hoped that this is the last burned offering [sacrifice].’

00:27:11.905 --> 00:27:23.181
David Boder: Aha. Yes, because I want to tell you, I have...the same that you have told me, was told to me by a boy from Buchenwald.

00:27:23.181 --> 00:27:23.622
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes.

00:27:23.622 --> 00:27:24.032
David Boder: You understand?

00:27:24.032 --> 00:27:24.533
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes.

00:27:24.533 --> 00:27:31.915
David Boder: And it is important that we get it from various corners of the world, we get the same story.

00:27:31.915 --> 00:27:34.619
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes, yes, yes, it is correct.

00:27:34.619 --> 00:27:37.746
David Boder: Nu, go on.

00:27:37.746 --> 00:28:28.688
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And we were so desperate. It is not understood even by us how the Jewish mother could give away her child. There were cases where the children were taken and they were hidden in ovens, plastered over. And there were such cases about which I know. A friend of mine took a child and gave it narcotics, and he put it in, one might say, in a far corner of the courtyard, because he figured that the police would go through the house in two hours, and he put it in such a hole and on top he strewed a little sand, just so it should not be known. And thus he saved his child. The largest majority could not find counsel to help themselves. There were cases that mothers went with the children. They were taken along.

00:28:28.688 --> 00:28:29.672
David Boder: The mothers were taken along.

00:28:29.672 --> 00:28:31.622
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes, such favors the German would do.

00:28:31.622 --> 00:28:32.334
David Boder: Yes?

00:28:32.334 --> 00:28:34.284
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes.

00:28:34.284 --> 00:28:37.290
David Boder: And that was approximately when?

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:39.632
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Everything happened from the 5th to the 12th of September.

00:28:39.632 --> 00:28:40.646
David Boder: In what year, ’42?

00:28:40.646 --> 00:28:41.871
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: ’42.

00:28:41.871 --> 00:28:52.302
David Boder: ’42. Nu, what happened after that? [Pause.] Nu, there were saved children. Were they later seen on the street, or what?

00:28:52.302 --> 00:28:53.695
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Who? The saved children?

00:28:53.695 --> 00:28:54.306
David Boder: Yes.

00:28:54.306 --> 00:29:05.840
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: It looked as if, that generally [in fact], the German had not [given?] such [?] an order, but we were gripped by such horror that we thought that we must comply at once. Otherwise he threatened us with immediate death and he would deport the entire ghetto. [Note: Does he imply that the order about the surrender of the children was conceived by the local German authorities without orders from above?]

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:06.270
David Boder: Yes.

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:28.571
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: But eventually, when the calamity had passed, we saw that whoever had saved himself had saved himself. But it did not really matter much, because eventually everybody had to pass through Auschwitz and Majdanek, so that he who had saved himself saved himself only for a certain time. However, with the children it resulted at that time that these two thousand [were saved] until we were deported.

00:29:28.571 --> 00:29:29.994
David Boder: How many were taken, two thousand?

00:29:29.994 --> 00:29:31.688
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Eighteen thousand were taken.

00:29:31.688 --> 00:29:32.570
David Boder: Yes?

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:36.491
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And [the] two thousand who had remained, these ultimately perished in Auschwitz.

00:29:36.491 --> 00:29:43.812
David Boder: Oh, nu? And so, that...now, how long were you in the Lodz
                        Ghetto,- until the liberation?

00:29:43.812 --> 00:29:44.694
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: No.

00:29:44.694 --> 00:29:45.606
David Boder: Aha.

00:29:45.606 --> 00:29:49.677
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: I was until the 25th [day] of the 8th [month] in the Lodz
                        Ghetto.

00:29:49.677 --> 00:29:52.876
David Boder: Yes. Nu? Until when?

00:29:52.876 --> 00:29:54.570
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: ’44.

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:54.570
David Boder: Yes, and where did you go from the Lodz Ghetto?

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:58.862
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: From the Lodz
                        Ghetto we were sent away to Auschwitz.

00:29:58.862 --> 00:30:01.114
David Boder: You, and so, let us now...

00:30:01.114 --> 00:30:05.629
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Myself, with my wife, with two children, with my two cousins...

00:30:05.629 --> 00:30:06.251
David Boder: Yes?

00:30:06.251 --> 00:30:09.498
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . who had come as deportees from Zdunska Wola, and I had taken them in with me.

00:30:09.498 --> 00:30:10.391
David Boder: Yes?

00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:12.160
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Charash was their name.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.687
David Boder: Charash or Karash?

00:30:13.687 --> 00:30:14.399
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Charash.

00:30:14.399 --> 00:30:15.534
David Boder: How is it spelled?

00:30:15.534 --> 00:30:21.377
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: With a Ch...C...H. There was another Karash, a little baker in Lodz by the name of Karash. It was not the...

00:30:21.377 --> 00:30:23.478
David Boder: With a K...that was another one.

00:30:23.478 --> 00:30:23.888
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: That was another one.

00:30:23.888 --> 00:30:25.264
David Boder: Nu?

00:30:25.264 --> 00:30:39.045
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: So then we were together. I, my wife, and my two [sons] makes four, and my two cousins who were living with [us] make six. They were girls, so that the wife and the girls went separately, and I with my two children whom I had succeeded in...

00:30:39.045 --> 00:30:40.421
David Boder: Boys.

00:30:40.421 --> 00:30:43.699
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Boys, yes, with whom I am living now here in Hénonville.

00:30:43.699 --> 00:30:44.532
David Boder: Yes.

00:30:44.532 --> 00:30:47.689
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And we were there twelve days.

00:30:47.689 --> 00:30:48.582
David Boder: Where, in Auschwitz?

00:30:48.582 --> 00:30:52.735
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: In Auschwitz. What we had gone through in Auschwitz is indescribable

00:30:52.735 --> 00:31:01.946
David Boder: And so, let us have this. When the train arrived in Auschwitz you were still in the same railroad car with your wife and the...the...

00:31:01.946 --> 00:31:03.521
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: With the wife and with the...the...with the...

00:31:03.521 --> 00:31:04.173
David Boder: . . . with the relatives and the children.

00:31:04.173 --> 00:31:04.704
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . with the children.

00:31:04.704 --> 00:31:07.951
David Boder: Nu, what happened in Auschwitz at the station?

00:31:07.951 --> 00:31:14.609
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: In Auschwitz, the moment we...We did not know anything. That whole secret had been so well kept that when we arrived in Auschwitz...

00:31:14.609 --> 00:31:15.201
David Boder: Hm.

00:31:15.201 --> 00:31:22.976
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . until we saw already through the window of the cars the barracks from afar and we had conceded to ourselves that we are lost, we were still thinking that we are being sent to work.

00:31:22.976 --> 00:31:23.568
David Boder: Yes.

00:31:23.568 --> 00:31:27.178
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: The German had persuaded us that now...we have to work...

00:31:27.178 --> 00:31:27.739
David Boder: Yes?

00:31:27.739 --> 00:31:37.234
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . and seeing that the Russians are approaching...and furthermore, he carried out propaganda among us to know that fierce battles will rage and all of us might fall at Lodz.

00:31:37.234 --> 00:31:37.946
David Boder: Hm.

00:31:37.946 --> 00:31:47.260
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: We should know that...and with bombs and with the great aerial danger which is to come, so that it will be very desirable for us to go to Germany to work.

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:47.670
David Boder: Yes?

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:56.169
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: We took along with us everything, the best that can only be, the last that we still possessed of clothing with the couple of shirts, because more we did not possess.

00:31:56.169 --> 00:31:57.455
David Boder: Nu?

00:31:57.455 --> 00:32:08.882
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And the moment we came near Auschwitz we saw at once our ruin. We saw already the huge barracks, and we saw already men and women. We saw already the Polish guards [?], and we saw that we were already lost.

00:32:08.882 --> 00:32:09.594
David Boder: Nu?

00:32:09.594 --> 00:32:17.731
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: The moment we got off in Auschwitz there stood on the spot an SS man, and he at once carried out the selection.

00:32:17.731 --> 00:32:19.168
David Boder: Yes?

00:32:19.168 --> 00:32:28.754
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: First of all men separately and women separately, old ones separately and young ones separately, those who appeared sickly separately and those appeared healthier went separately.

00:32:28.754 --> 00:32:30.311
David Boder: Nu?

00:32:30.311 --> 00:32:33.136
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: My wife and the...and the two girls...

00:32:33.136 --> 00:32:33.788
David Boder: Yes?

00:32:33.788 --> 00:32:38.243
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . the cousins, were immediately taken away from me so that I did not see them any more.

00:32:38.243 --> 00:32:47.466
David Boder: They were not afterwards in the women’s quarter? Could one find out in Auschwitz...could a husband discover whether his wife is in a block there or not?

00:32:47.466 --> 00:32:49.627
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: No.

00:32:49.627 --> 00:32:50.762
David Boder: One could not.

00:32:50.762 --> 00:32:53.074
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: One could not find out.

00:32:53.074 --> 00:32:53.967
David Boder: Nu?

00:32:53.967 --> 00:32:57.335
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Possibly in a few counted cases, but [in general] one could not find out.

00:32:57.335 --> 00:33:01.760
David Boder: So then perhaps they were taken to the women’s block?

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:15.692
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Perhaps they were taken. I do not know whether they had perished in Auschwitz or were taken to the women’s block and later on they went to Stutthoff where people were being taken. I had some sort of regards from [through] one young girl who had been in the same railroad car with us.

00:33:15.692 --> 00:33:16.314
David Boder: Hm.

00:33:16.314 --> 00:33:29.914
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: So I figure that she had probably been deported together with my wife and the two cousins. She did come back. Then she told me that there in Stutthoff—that is near Danzig on the Baltic Sea—that the people had been taken there and drowned. From there...[?]

00:33:29.914 --> 00:33:30.626
David Boder: Drowned?

00:33:30.626 --> 00:33:35.865
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes. Admitting that my wife was perhaps weak and sick...

00:33:35.865 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: Hm.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:33:36.275
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . it is possible that she had perhaps perished in Auschwitz, but the two cousins that I had sent along, they were two strong, healthy girls.

00:33:36.275 --> 00:33:36.504
David Boder: Hm.

00:33:36.504 --> 00:33:43.916
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Seeing that they did not come back, it is highly probable, as much as I looked for information...

00:33:43.916 --> 00:33:44.417
David Boder: Yes.

00:33:44.417 --> 00:33:49.536
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . and as much as it was vital for me to find some news, that they perished there in Stutthoff.

00:33:49.536 --> 00:33:49.856
David Boder: Yes?

00:33:49.856 --> 00:33:58.446
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Quite simple—they had drowned them there in the sea.

00:33:58.446 --> 00:34:02.086
David Boder: Hm. What happened to you in Auschwitz?

00:34:02.086 --> 00:34:05.303
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: I was in Auschwitz twelve days.

00:34:05.303 --> 00:34:06.257
David Boder: Together with the two boys?

00:34:06.257 --> 00:34:28.398
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Always together with the two boys. I also took pains, with God’s, praised be His Name, help, that although we were in separate blocks, we still took pains just to keep together. And we were together. The life in Auschwitz is indescribable. I think that you are sufficiently informed and know already...

00:34:28.398 --> 00:34:30.559
David Boder: Were you tattooed?

00:34:30.559 --> 00:34:31.060
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: No.

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:31.802
David Boder: How do you explain that?

00:34:31.802 --> 00:34:32.514
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: We...[?]

00:34:32.514 --> 00:34:34.675
David Boder: In Auschwitz people were tattooed.

00:34:34.675 --> 00:34:36.836
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: But not all were tattooed.

00:34:36.836 --> 00:34:37.307
David Boder: Hm.

00:34:37.307 --> 00:34:47.496
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Those who worked in Birkenau were tattooed and even such who were sent away. Precisely the group with which we went to the vicinity of Chemitz, to a plant of Auto-Union, well, this group was not tattooed.

00:34:47.496 --> 00:34:50.140
David Boder: Hm. You went together with your two sons.

00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:51.426
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: I went together with my two sons.

00:34:51.426 --> 00:35:02.024
David Boder: Did it cost you there some efforts to remain together, or did it happen by itself?

00:35:02.024 --> 00:35:07.384
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: [Pause.] Not especially. It was more luck than trouble, I must tell you.

00:35:07.384 --> 00:35:09.424
David Boder: Yes. What does luck mean?

00:35:09.424 --> 00:35:21.303
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: That means luck played for me. I was together with the children, and they were already somewhat like grown-ups. We always saw to it...In Auschwitz there was such a work-detail.

00:35:21.303 --> 00:35:21.804
David Boder: Hm.

00:35:21.804 --> 00:35:24.086
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And there people registered who wanted to go to work.

00:35:24.086 --> 00:35:24.466
David Boder: Hm.

00:35:24.466 --> 00:35:32.301
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: So that we had made up that if something will happen, so that if we should have to go away, then we all should register together in order to be together again.

00:35:32.301 --> 00:35:32.591
David Boder: Nu?

00:35:32.591 --> 00:35:35.386
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And we succeeded in it, and we arrived...

00:35:35.386 --> 00:35:40.807
David Boder: Oh, they asked who wanted to go to work and you registered yourself.

00:35:40.807 --> 00:35:48.853
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: I had registered myself, and naturally there was a doctor, too. We were all checked, and thus we were all sent to the vicinity of Chemnitz, near [name not clear].

00:35:48.853 --> 00:35:49.777
David Boder: Hm.

00:35:49.777 --> 00:35:58.641
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And after that we were in...in...[pause].

00:35:58.641 --> 00:36:01.375
David Boder: Nu? It does not matter. In some other place.

00:36:01.375 --> 00:36:07.490
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: In another place. This factory was burned down by the bombing.

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:08.564
David Boder: Hm.

00:36:08.564 --> 00:36:13.773
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And there we worked until the 13th [day] of the 4th [month].

00:36:13.773 --> 00:36:15.361
David Boder: The 13th of April.

00:36:15.361 --> 00:36:16.315
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: 1945, yes.

00:36:16.315 --> 00:36:18.204
David Boder: 1945, nu?

00:36:18.204 --> 00:36:26.552
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: I have to say that until the 15th [day] of the 2nd [month] the conditions were not so bad yet...

00:36:26.552 --> 00:36:27.083
David Boder: Hm.

00:36:27.083 --> 00:36:28.308
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . in comparison with Auschwitz and the ghetto life.

00:36:28.308 --> 00:36:28.598
David Boder: Hm.

00:36:28.598 --> 00:36:37.731
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: We had comparatively [tolerable] conditions. We got a bread of a kilo and a half for eight persons, and a soup...

00:36:37.731 --> 00:36:38.504
David Boder: Every day?

00:36:38.504 --> 00:36:39.971
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Every day we got a soup.

00:36:39.971 --> 00:36:40.774
David Boder: Aha.

00:36:40.774 --> 00:36:52.740
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Thus, we received no underwear, except for the only shirt which we had received in Auschwitz. That we wore until liberation.

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.810
David Boder: And that was how long, six months?

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:58.118
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: That was from the 5th [day] of the 9th [month]...

00:36:58.118 --> 00:36:58.649
David Boder: Yes?

00:36:58.649 --> 00:37:06.122
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: until the 13th [day] of the 4th [month]. No...the 13th [day] of the 4th [month] we left Auschwitz, but then until the 7th of May we still wore that shirt.

00:37:06.122 --> 00:37:06.955
David Boder: The same shirt.

00:37:06.955 --> 00:37:07.547
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes.

00:37:07.547 --> 00:37:12.108
David Boder: Aha. Who come? Who liberated you? In...

00:37:12.108 --> 00:37:19.279
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Then it happened that the...the Americans began approaching and the factory was in danger...

00:37:19.279 --> 00:37:19.810
David Boder: Hm.

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:33.591
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: that means, so as not to be surrounded then it came that we started to march out. We were not able to march very far. This is a separate chapter by itself. Of all the periods that we went through...

00:37:33.591 --> 00:37:33.941
David Boder: Hm.

00:37:33.941 --> 00:37:39.885
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: then this chapter of the march from the 13th [day] of the 4th [month] until the liberation on the 7th of May presents something special [unique].

00:37:39.885 --> 00:37:40.416
David Boder: Yes?

00:37:40.416 --> 00:37:45.971
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: This is a separate...one must have special journalistic talents...

00:37:45.971 --> 00:37:46.502
David Boder: I do not want journalistic talents...

00:37:46.502 --> 00:37:46.912
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: to be able to describe it.

00:37:46.912 --> 00:37:52.242
David Boder: . . . journalistic talents. We want...let others be the journalists. I am not a journalist, and you are not a journalist.

00:37:52.242 --> 00:37:53.407
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Journalist, yes.

00:37:53.407 --> 00:38:01.483
David Boder: And so, in plain language, tell me what happened there. [Chuckle.] One does not need for that journalistic talents.

00:38:01.483 --> 00:38:01.863
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes.

00:38:01.863 --> 00:38:08.098
David Boder: Just the facts. I want to tell you, we just want to ‘accuse’ expose the deeds of the Germans. [It seems that within the context of this interview, as one of many, and considering the time it was taken, no apology should be required even from a scientist, for the last sentence. D.P.B.]

00:38:08.098 --> 00:38:08.659
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes.

00:38:08.659 --> 00:38:11.514
David Boder: And we want the facts. Nu?

00:38:11.514 --> 00:38:30.305
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And so, the facts were that we marched daily, the least, fifteen kilometers, and thirty kilometers we marched, too. We made a march from Chemnitz to the vicinity of Marienbad, Karlsbad.

00:38:30.305 --> 00:38:30.655
David Boder: Hm.

00:38:30.655 --> 00:38:31.126
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: We had marched...

00:38:31.126 --> 00:38:32.140
David Boder: That is Czechoslavakia.

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:32.822
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes.

00:38:32.822 --> 00:38:34.168
David Boder: Yes?

00:38:34.168 --> 00:38:38.381
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: We got six potatoes a day.

00:38:38.381 --> 00:38:39.123
David Boder: Hm.

00:38:39.123 --> 00:38:50.731
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: No [word not clear] potatoes, not always cooked. But if we would stop for a day, they would be boiled there...if we would stop for a day. If it would happen that we would march on, or stayed only for twelve hours...

00:38:50.731 --> 00:38:51.172
David Boder: How many people...

00:38:51.172 --> 00:38:51.552
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . they would not be cooked.

00:38:51.552 --> 00:38:52.626
David Boder: . . . were marching?

00:38:52.626 --> 00:38:57.956
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: We marched...This I want to explain to you. We were in the factory four hundred and fifty people.

00:38:57.956 --> 00:38:58.729
David Boder: Oh.

00:38:58.729 --> 00:39:10.276
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: We lived there from the beginning of 9th month [’44] to the 13th [day] of the 4th [month]. The mortality was, I must tell you...only eight persons [of our factory group] had died in the entire eight months.

00:39:10.276 --> 00:39:10.777
David Boder: Yes.

00:39:10.777 --> 00:39:11.912
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: But when we began...

00:39:11.912 --> 00:39:12.775
David Boder: That is not too many.

00:39:12.775 --> 00:39:14.574
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: No, rather not too many.

00:39:14.574 --> 00:39:15.558
David Boder: Nu.

00:39:15.558 --> 00:39:24.027
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: But afterwards when we marched from the 13th [day] of the 4th [month] until the 7th of May hundred and fifty persons had died.

00:39:24.027 --> 00:39:30.806
David Boder: Yes. How does one know these [exact] numbers? Whether a hundred and fifty, whether a hundred and thirty...

00:39:30.806 --> 00:39:31.911
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: I will explain it to you.

00:39:31.911 --> 00:39:32.291
David Boder: Yes.

00:39:32.291 --> 00:39:32.852
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Because there was...

00:39:32.852 --> 00:39:34.168
David Boder: You understand why I am asking?

00:39:34.168 --> 00:39:41.792
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes, yes, yes. Because there was a scribe there in the office as long as we were there in the factory.

00:39:41.792 --> 00:39:42.172
David Boder: Hm.

00:39:42.172 --> 00:39:52.723
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: We would enter the day shift and the night shift, and issuing the rations, naturally for everything there had to be entries [in the books]. His name is...a certain...his name was Szaja Spiegel.

00:39:52.723 --> 00:39:53.586
David Boder: Hm.

00:39:53.586 --> 00:40:17.719
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And he is now in Lodz. He kept [preserved?] all the files [card indexes]. We still figured if we should be soon liberated and the families will be, too, then everybody must be informed, ‘you should know your mother had died. Your brother had died.’ He kept [took care of] the files [card indexes] each day as to how large the mortality was, so that he knows about the mortality up to the last moment.

00:40:17.719 --> 00:40:26.294
David Boder: Aha. Nu. Good, that is a good answer. Nu, go on. What happened on the road?

00:40:26.294 --> 00:40:39.260
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: On the road happened just...we were just marching, and at night to sleep we were given a barn where we could go in...where normally could go in sixty, seventy people. So they would put us in there, all the four hundred and fifty persons.

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:39.942
David Boder: Hm.

00:40:39.942 --> 00:40:57.737
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And during the day we marched again, and through that marching people would drop like flies. Without food, just marching.

00:40:57.737 --> 00:41:00.502
David Boder: And what would be done with the people who fell?

00:41:00.502 --> 00:41:05.802
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: The fallen people...they took a ditch which had been dug and they were...and they were buried.

00:41:05.802 --> 00:41:11.766
David Boder: That means when they were dead. And when people remained behind from weakness?

00:41:11.766 --> 00:41:16.100
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: People who remained behind from weakness...there were cases that they were shot, too.

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:17.386
David Boder: Nu, and [words not clear]?

00:41:17.386 --> 00:41:19.275
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . who had lagged behind.

00:41:19.275 --> 00:41:20.229
David Boder: And in other cases?

00:41:20.229 --> 00:41:25.106
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: In other cases [it] would happen that they would tell us to lead [transport?] the people.

00:41:25.106 --> 00:41:26.180
David Boder: Lead [transport and lead, both translations could be correct].

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:42.285
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And besides, I must...there were carts, too. The SS man of our group was not yet the greatest enemy of Israel. So far the weak who had to be taken in carts [?] he somehow...he rented us carts. That means he requisitioned carts there and they were transported.

00:41:42.285 --> 00:41:43.209
David Boder: With horses?

00:41:43.209 --> 00:41:43.921
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: With horses.

00:41:43.921 --> 00:41:47.078
David Boder: Hm. So then he was a kind enough SS man.

00:41:47.078 --> 00:41:51.472
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Naturally one must admit [that] according to what we hear about others, that means to us already...

00:41:51.472 --> 00:41:52.486
David Boder: Yes.

00:41:52.486 --> 00:41:54.556
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . a kind one.

00:41:54.556 --> 00:41:57.079
David Boder: What was he, an officer, or a...

00:41:57.079 --> 00:41:58.093
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: A corporal.

00:41:58.093 --> 00:42:00.858
David Boder: A corporal with assistants.

00:42:00.858 --> 00:42:01.721
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: With assistants, yes.

00:42:01.721 --> 00:42:10.461
David Boder: Nu, and on the road, while walking or running, did one not talk with the SS men occasionally?

00:42:10.461 --> 00:42:20.801
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: There were such with whom we did talk, and they would say already ‘You should know that you will not suffer too much longer.’

00:42:20.801 --> 00:42:22.177
David Boder: Why?

00:42:22.177 --> 00:42:24.247
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: That means the war is coming to an end already.

00:42:24.247 --> 00:42:25.472
David Boder: Yes.

00:42:25.472 --> 00:42:28.780
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Those were the same who were also guarding us in the factory.

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:30.488
David Boder: Hm.

00:42:30.488 --> 00:42:37.478
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And they would explain to us, too...[in low voice] there were among them...[repeats aloud] there were among them such who were communists, such who were communists, but they were a very small percentage.

00:42:37.478 --> 00:42:43.563
David Boder: Yes. Nu? Then where did you arrive?

00:42:43.563 --> 00:42:48.621
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: We arrived in the vicinity of Marienbad.

00:42:48.621 --> 00:42:49.243
David Boder: Yes?

00:42:49.243 --> 00:42:50.770
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: About fifteen kilometers.

00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:52.327
David Boder: Yes?

00:42:52.327 --> 00:43:10.574
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And there we already saw that there is no more...we are already surrounded from all sides, so while walking...somehow we...we could feel that the skin is already burning on the SS men, so we sat down and we said we are not going any further. And he said too, ‘Well, I am setting you free...’

00:43:10.574 --> 00:43:11.558
David Boder: Yes?

00:43:11.558 --> 00:43:12.693
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: ‘...and go home.’

00:43:12.693 --> 00:43:15.790
David Boder: What did he say? He said you are free?

00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:19.158
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: ‘You are free.’ And they scattered and left us.

00:43:19.158 --> 00:43:20.051
David Boder: Yes?

00:43:20.051 --> 00:43:21.910
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And thus we were...

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:25.369
David Boder: Hm. They did not try to kill the people or...

00:43:25.369 --> 00:43:31.061
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: No. Because they themselves saw already that their blessings [?] are over.

00:43:31.061 --> 00:43:33.645
David Boder: And they took along their rifles and they scattered.

00:43:33.645 --> 00:43:34.810
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: They took along their rifles and they scattered.

00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:35.033
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: We remained hefker [abandoned] on the road.

00:43:35.033 --> 00:43:36.035
David Boder: What does it mean, ‘hefker’? [It also means on our own.]

00:43:36.035 --> 00:43:49.103
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: We went around the villages there and begged. We got there something to eat. There was no...we were in Czechoslavakia and the Czechs treated us very decently.

00:43:49.103 --> 00:43:50.558
David Boder: Oh, it was in Czechoslavakia.

00:43:50.558 --> 00:43:51.385
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: It was, yes.

00:43:51.385 --> 00:43:54.331
David Boder: Aha. And so, that was the end.

00:43:54.331 --> 00:43:54.832
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes.

00:43:54.832 --> 00:44:00.917
David Boder: And then where did you go when you were liberated? Did you go back to Lodz?

00:44:00.917 --> 00:44:03.501
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: All, the majority of us went back to Lodz.

00:44:03.501 --> 00:44:04.787
David Boder: I mean you yourself.

00:44:04.787 --> 00:44:07.220
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: I myself did not go back. Why not?

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:08.385
David Boder: And your two sons were with you...

00:44:08.385 --> 00:44:08.946
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes.

00:44:08.946 --> 00:44:09.224
David Boder: . . . all the time?

00:44:09.224 --> 00:44:10.715
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: My sons were together with me all the time.

00:44:10.715 --> 00:44:11.639
David Boder: So you did not go back.

00:44:11.639 --> 00:44:16.909
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: No. Why not? Seeing that we knew that we have property in Eretz Yisroeil.

00:44:16.909 --> 00:44:17.863
David Boder: Yes.

00:44:17.863 --> 00:44:25.336
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And we did not believe any more...we knew that the family is no more. We considered it purposeless. And to go and build in Poland we did not...

00:44:25.336 --> 00:44:26.109
David Boder: Hm.

00:44:26.109 --> 00:44:35.332
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . want any more. And we thought that we will be able to enter Eretz Yisroeil. And so, arriving in Prague, both of my children fell sick. They began to have fever.

00:44:35.332 --> 00:44:37.433
David Boder: Hm.

00:44:37.433 --> 00:44:40.318
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And they lay in the hospital three months.

00:44:40.318 --> 00:44:41.121
David Boder: Hm.

00:44:41.121 --> 00:44:57.287
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: With high fever. And so, with difficulties, I got [rescued] them out. At that time I saw to get in touch with an unofficial Aliyah [a society], that means that I should be able to black myself across [cross the border illegally] and go again on foot to Italy, and from there to get to Israel. I saw it was impossible.

00:44:57.287 --> 00:45:02.315
David Boder: Oh, with an unofficial Aliyah. Those who go secretly through Italy, yes.

00:45:02.315 --> 00:45:02.315
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Through Italy. So we realized that this is not for our strength. For the children neither because they were very run down. They were skin and bones.

00:45:02.315 --> 00:45:12.401
David Boder: Yes?

00:45:12.401 --> 00:45:19.451
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And I counted on that, too, seeing that I have a home of my own in...in Tel Aviv, and also a house from my father, so that we have had invested in Tel Aviv...

00:45:19.451 --> 00:45:23.604
David Boder: Why did you buy the houses? Was your father in Palestine?

00:45:23.604 --> 00:45:25.976
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes, and I too. I was there too, yes.

00:45:25.976 --> 00:45:27.443
David Boder: And you had brought there the houses...

00:45:27.443 --> 00:45:27.853
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes.

00:45:27.853 --> 00:45:28.445
David Boder: . . . in Tel Aviv.

00:45:28.445 --> 00:45:28.886
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes.

00:45:28.886 --> 00:45:30.051
David Boder: And what, rented out?

00:45:30.051 --> 00:45:37.584
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Rented out naturally, for rent. In 1936 we invested there ten thousand pounds. So that my children and I figured...

00:45:37.584 --> 00:45:38.296
David Boder: Yes.

00:45:38.296 --> 00:45:43.475
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . that we, because we have there our property and will not be a burden to anyone...

00:45:43.475 --> 00:45:43.855
David Boder: Yes.

00:45:43.855 --> 00:45:47.314
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . we will sure have the right and will not need to go with the Aliyah B...

00:45:47.314 --> 00:45:47.604
David Boder: Yes.

00:45:47.604 --> 00:45:54.844
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . and we will be able to enter Eretz Yisroeil, but at the end we see that...we were not able to enter Eretz Yisroeil.

00:45:54.844 --> 00:46:02.649
David Boder: Who is responsible for the certificates, that you are not getting them? Every month fifteen hundred certificates are available.

00:46:02.649 --> 00:46:39.686
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: What does it mean who is responsible? With fifteen hundred certificates, the capitalists...when the Aliyah stopped...only the so-called children were let in. I do not know at all who did go on the fifteen hundred certificates. I only know it is one great cry to heaven that I who have an estate which before the war was worth ten thousand pounds—today in Eretz Yisroeil it is valued at thirty thousand pounds—and [excitedly with tears in his voice] I am sitting here with my children, undernourished, and do not eat meat all week, and not wearing adequate clothing, and not having adequate shoes, and cannot enter Eretz Yisroeil. This is a crime which should awaken the conscience of the world!

00:46:39.686 --> 00:46:43.356
David Boder: And that which you had hidden in Lodz, did you find it?

00:46:43.356 --> 00:46:47.207
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: I have hidden it, but I am afraid to go to Lodz.

00:46:47.207 --> 00:46:48.734
David Boder: It is still hidden.

00:46:48.734 --> 00:47:03.143
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: It is still hidden. We have left a factory, too, in Zdunska Wola, which has been nationalized. I do not even have an interest to go and take it back. Because I am only...my only desire is to be able to go to Eretz Yisroeil, and there I will already live through my years.

00:47:03.143 --> 00:47:05.153
David Boder: Why don’t you eat meat all week?

00:47:05.153 --> 00:47:09.759
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: That is very simple, because there is none.

00:47:09.759 --> 00:47:11.407
David Boder: One has no means?

00:47:11.407 --> 00:47:15.681
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: One has no financial means. There are none. In the German lager there is still an UNRRA. There still is...

00:47:15.681 --> 00:47:22.128
David Boder: You say that you are getting rent in Palestine. Can’t they send the money from there? Pardon me for asking that.

00:47:22.128 --> 00:47:28.635
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: You have a perfect right and you are completely in order. I must explain to you this, that the English made a law...

00:47:28.635 --> 00:47:29.257
David Boder: Oh.

00:47:29.257 --> 00:47:38.360
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: . . . that all those who are there...that means, the property of enemy aliens, of people who are not there, all that reverted under the [control of] English government.

00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:39.827
David Boder: But it is deposited. It is being kept for you.

00:47:39.827 --> 00:47:43.225
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Everything is being kept there and deposited.

00:47:43.225 --> 00:47:45.658
David Boder: What sort of enemy alien are you?

00:47:45.658 --> 00:48:01.370
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: I do not know. That is how it was. It seems that Jews are enemies, because all that was...in the end it is not just for enemy aliens. Later it was done because all the heirs were not there, because there are huge estates to which there are no claimants, so the government took it all away [over].

00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:02.203
David Boder: In Palestine?

00:48:02.203 --> 00:48:09.223
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: In Palestine, yes. Up to now I was in Germany in a lager [DP] camp and had no chance whatsoever to communicate. It was very hard. They did not...all languages were...

00:48:09.223 --> 00:48:10.871
David Boder: Were you there in the [DP] camp with the children?

00:48:10.871 --> 00:48:11.855
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: I was, yes.

00:48:11.855 --> 00:48:12.899
David Boder: In which one?

00:48:12.899 --> 00:48:14.819
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: In Landsberg. A whole year.

00:48:14.819 --> 00:48:16.346
David Boder: Yes. After the liberation.

00:48:16.346 --> 00:48:19.201
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: After the liberation. Where we were maintained by the UNRRA.

00:48:19.201 --> 00:48:19.853
David Boder: Yes?

00:48:19.853 --> 00:48:25.907
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: I could not send mail to Eretz Yisroeil. I must mention that this is also an unheard of wrong.

00:48:25.907 --> 00:48:26.589
David Boder: Yes?

00:48:26.589 --> 00:48:33.730
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Letters can be sent in English, in French, in Russian, and in Polish, but Yiddish letters cannot be written [sent]. And so I had...

00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:34.322
David Boder: [Words not clear.]

00:48:34.322 --> 00:48:35.457
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: To Palestine.

00:48:35.457 --> 00:48:37.437
David Boder: From the American zone?

00:48:37.437 --> 00:48:38.693
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: From the American zone. [This seems incorrect. Refers possibly to telegrams.]

00:48:38.693 --> 00:48:40.431
David Boder: The Americans have no Jewish censors?

00:48:40.431 --> 00:48:44.222
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: That’s how it is. And so I am affirming it as a fact.

00:48:44.222 --> 00:48:45.810
David Boder: Yes? Nu?

00:48:45.810 --> 00:48:47.880
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: That one cannot write in Yiddish.

00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:48.260
David Boder: And this is still until today?

00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:53.017
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: This is still until today. I left...until three weks ago one could not write in Yiddish [??].

00:48:53.017 --> 00:48:53.941
David Boder: From Landsberg.

00:48:53.941 --> 00:49:01.263
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: From Landsberg. Just these four languages. English, French and German and Polish.

00:49:01.263 --> 00:49:04.178
David Boder: Polish. Nu?

00:49:04.178 --> 00:49:07.425
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Nu, I began to correspond.

00:49:07.425 --> 00:49:08.137
David Boder: With Palestine.

00:49:08.137 --> 00:49:10.932
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: With Palestine. So that I am...so that...

00:49:10.932 --> 00:49:12.882
David Boder: Did you enter France legally?

00:49:12.882 --> 00:49:16.492
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: I entered France legally. [Words not clear.]

00:49:16.492 --> 00:49:18.351
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:49:18.351 --> 00:49:29.838
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: But, unfortunately, I am sorry that I came too late. If I had come earlier I would have been able to enter with the Aliyah B. Today I hear people are going to Cyprus, but I must say that my...

00:49:29.838 --> 00:49:31.788
David Boder: The Aliyah B is the underground Aliyah.

00:49:31.788 --> 00:49:34.734
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes. The under...the so-called illegal Aliyah.

00:49:34.734 --> 00:49:37.559
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:49:37.559 --> 00:49:48.352
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: So that I myself, I cannot decide whether to go to Cyprus. The children do not want to stay here. They say even to Cyprus they want to go. And so, in any case, I want to return to your question.

00:49:48.352 --> 00:49:50.694
David Boder: Cyprus or no Cyprus, they want to go.

00:49:50.694 --> 00:49:51.225
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Yes.

00:49:51.225 --> 00:49:51.696
David Boder: Yes?

00:49:51.696 --> 00:50:07.474
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: In any case...because to suffer hunger here—it makes no difference to them. Let it be Cyprus as long as it is near Eretz Yisroeil. They think there they will be closer. In any case I want to return to your question. You asked that if having there such an estate which before the war brought in around seven hundred pounds per year, why I should suffer hunger here.

00:50:07.474 --> 00:50:07.867
David Boder: Yes.

00:50:07.867 --> 00:50:20.778
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: I am explaining to you that it is for the reason that it was frozen, my estate, and that is why I have no means. And I am not let in either, so that I am now in a completely desperate situation.

00:50:20.778 --> 00:50:24.991
David Boder: And so, you see then that everyone has a different story.

00:50:24.991 --> 00:50:33.943
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Naturally. Everyone has different troubles, and everyone has a different story.

00:50:33.943 --> 00:50:39.364
David Boder: And what do you now in Paris? Do you talk with the English? Do you try to do something?

00:50:39.364 --> 00:50:39.364
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: There are many people arriving from Eretz Yisroeil. I think that if someone will be able...I plead that perhaps my account may be opened. I want to do it through a notary, that I am here with two children, that something should be given to me to live on from my estate.

00:50:39.364 --> 00:50:54.551
David Boder: [Words not clear.]

00:50:54.551 --> 00:51:00.062
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And I do not have an answer yet. And then, it is only three weeks since I have come to Paris.

00:51:00.062 --> 00:51:02.646
David Boder: Hm. And you are staying in Paris and the children are staying here?

00:51:02.646 --> 00:51:02.646
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: And the children are here.

00:51:02.646 --> 00:51:06.123
David Boder: What is the name of the Kibbutz here?

00:51:06.123 --> 00:51:07.409
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Hénonville.

00:51:07.409 --> 00:51:11.139
David Boder: No, no, no, I mean the Kibbutz.

00:51:11.139 --> 00:51:12.183
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: What the name is?

00:51:12.183 --> 00:51:13.921
David Boder: The Kibbutz has a name.

00:51:13.921 --> 00:51:15.116
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Neizach Yisroeil.

00:51:15.116 --> 00:51:19.963
David Boder: Hm, the Neizach Yisroeil. And have you always been a Hassid?

00:51:19.963 --> 00:51:28.945
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: I always have been a Hassid. I come from Hassidic parents, and I remain a Hassidic Jew, and will go on bringing up my children as Hassidic Jewish children.

00:51:28.945 --> 00:51:42.333
David Boder: And so, Mr. Rosenfeld, I thank you very much. You have given me a very good report, and I am convinced it will do something for us all.

00:51:42.333 --> 00:51:44.373
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: But I want to ask you again...

00:51:44.373 --> 00:51:44.663
David Boder: Hm.

00:51:44.663 --> 00:52:01.121
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: I want to ask you to talk to the Jewish commonwealth [Klal Yisroeil], that they should all see...we are tormented here greatly. And we are suffering. We have no housing and we have no food. We have nothing. The situation has not improved much over the German times, but this, especially, I must...

00:52:01.121 --> 00:52:03.161
David Boder: Come, come...

00:52:03.161 --> 00:52:05.533
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Nu, naturally we are not under SS men.

00:52:05.533 --> 00:52:07.453
David Boder: You do not tremble for your life.

00:52:07.453 --> 00:52:29.895
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: We do not tremble for our lives, but we do not have the proper nourishment. We are undernourished. You have to know that five, six, seven years we were undernourished. Today we should be fed a little better, and we do not have it. Moreover, I am a man who has such a fortune in Eretz Yisroeil. I am sure I do not have to be a burden to anyone. Why must I have to suffer here?

00:52:29.895 --> 00:52:37.157
David Boder: Nu, you will pay it back someday [that is, what you receive from charity]. You will give it back. You don’t have to worry over it.

00:52:37.157 --> 00:52:41.150
Pinkhus Rosenfeld: Nu, but in the meantime...

00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:55.375
David Boder: Hm. And so, one has to view things from all sides. Maybe this little story will contribute a bit of truth to the whole situation. And so...

00:52:55.375 --> 00:52:56.751
David Boder: [In English] Hénonville, September the 13th, 1946, near Paris.
