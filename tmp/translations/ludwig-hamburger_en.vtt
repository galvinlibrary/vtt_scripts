Ludwig Hamburger: Born in Poland...Poland.

00:00:26.416 --> 00:00:27.292
David Boder: In what city?

00:00:27.292 --> 00:00:28.308
Ludwig Hamburger: In Katowice.

00:00:28.308 --> 00:00:29.120
David Boder: Oh.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.725
Ludwig Hamburger: Nineteen years old.

00:00:30.725 --> 00:00:32.009
David Boder: You are nineteen years old.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:32.621
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes.

00:00:32.621 --> 00:00:40.400
David Boder: Now tell us, Mr. Hamburger, where were you when the started and what happened to you then?

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.687
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes. It is a long story.

00:00:41.687 --> 00:00:43.967
David Boder: Yes. But tell us. We have time.

00:00:43.967 --> 00:00:47.119
Ludwig Hamburger: It is like this. In the beginning of the war everything was all right.

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:48.835
David Boder: You may speak Yiddish if you wish.

00:00:48.835 --> 00:00:56.521
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes. Everything was nice and right. I was in Katowice together with my parents and then [words not clear]...

00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:58.022
David Boder: Yes?

00:00:58.022 --> 00:01:00.041
Ludwig Hamburger: I was torn from my dear parents...

00:01:00.041 --> 00:01:00.472
David Boder: Yes.

00:01:00.472 --> 00:01:02.167
Ludwig Hamburger: ...and I was left alone.

00:01:02.167 --> 00:01:02.849
David Boder: yes.

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:14.866
Ludwig Hamburger: From there I was sent to concentration camp Auschwitz and then to Buchenwald. In Buchenwald I lived through the worst, but also the best. I was liberated there.

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:15.080
David Boder: Yes.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.868
Ludwig Hamburger: By the American Third Army.

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:17.229
David Boder: Yes.

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.677
Ludwig Hamburger: And then I came to Switzerland.

00:01:19.677 --> 00:01:22.027
David Boder: All right. Now then.

00:01:22.027 --> 00:01:23.752
Ludwig Hamburger: [ Sobs.]

00:01:23.752 --> 00:01:37.525
David Boder: And so, would you go back again. Tell me how and under what circumstances were you separated from your parents? Where was it? When was it? And so forth.

00:01:37.525 --> 00:01:43.275
Ludwig Hamburger: It was...[still in tears] in the nicest period of the summer

00:01:43.275 --> 00:01:44.208
David Boder: Well[?].

00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:59.704
Ludwig Hamburger: It was summer. The Nazis had it in their minds to exterminate all the Jews. We were assembled on a big...on a big square, together with my parents, with my only sister, and then were separated.

00:01:59.704 --> 00:02:00.076
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:00.076 --> 00:02:01.002
Ludwig Hamburger: Men separately...

00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:01.777
David Boder: Tell ,me... Yes.

00:02:01.777 --> 00:02:09.096
Ludwig Hamburger: Men separately, women separately, and children separately. The children...they experienced the worst.

00:02:09.096 --> 00:02:10.059
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:16.489
Ludwig Hamburger: They were simply murdered. They were exterminated. Not like human beings. They treated us worse than animals.

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.879
David Boder: How? Were you with the children?

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.705
Ludwig Hamburger: No, I was already with the young people.

00:02:20.705 --> 00:02:21.982
David Boder: You were with the young people. Have you...

00:02:21.982 --> 00:02:23.309
Ludwig Hamburger: I observed everything, and I...

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:26.191
David Boder: What did you see? Tell me everything that you have seen.

00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:33.255
Ludwig Hamburger: I saw an event I myself lived through, in Upper Silesia in the ghetto.

00:02:33.255 --> 00:02:36.562
David Boder: But I would like you to tell me how it was in Katowice.

00:02:36.562 --> 00:02:39.331
Ludwig Hamburger: In Katowice we were assembled on large...on a large square...

00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:39.836
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:39.836 --> 00:02:43.209
Ludwig Hamburger: ...and we were sorted out, men , children, young people, and women.

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.784
David Boder: And you were with...

00:02:44.784 --> 00:02:45.870
Ludwig Hamburger: I was with the young people.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.220
David Boder: Yes. Were there among the young people boys and girls?

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.397
Ludwig Hamburger: No, only boys.

00:02:51.397 --> 00:02:52.493
David Boder: Yes?

00:02:52.493 --> 00:02:59.304
Ludwig Hamburger: And then we were [?] taken to the work-lager, and the older ones were sent back to Auschwitz...burned.

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:02.607
David Boder: The older ones were sent...And so, where did your parents remain?

00:03:02.607 --> 00:03:07.545
Ludwig Hamburger: I never saw my parents again, since 1941. Since then.

00:03:07.545 --> 00:03:09.835
David Boder: Since the time when you were called out to the square?

00:03:09.835 --> 00:03:10.319
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes.

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.927
David Boder: Yes. Have you tried to find your parents?

00:03:12.927 --> 00:03:13.830
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes, surely.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.528
David Boder: Where did you look for them?

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:20.974
Ludwig Hamburger: I inquired with the OSE, in Switzerland, and the refugee aides and with the Red...with the International Red Cross.

00:03:20.974 --> 00:03:21.784
David Boder: You inquired.

00:03:21.784 --> 00:03:22.186
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes.

00:03:22.186 --> 00:03:22.500
David Boder: Yes, but...

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.687
Ludwig Hamburger: But no news.

00:03:23.687 --> 00:03:31.997
David Boder: And so, you were taken to the work-lager.

00:03:31.997 --> 00:03:36.133
Ludwig Hamburger: I came to the work-lager still as a child of only fourteen years.

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:38.737
David Boder: Yes. Did they know that you were fourteen years old?

00:03:38.737 --> 00:03:39.552
Ludwig Hamburger: No.

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:40.245
David Boder: What did they know?

00:03:40.245 --> 00:03:42.234
Ludwig Hamburger: We all told them we were older.

00:03:42.234 --> 00:03:43.120
David Boder: Why?

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.095
Ludwig Hamburger: Because as fourteen year old children we had no right to live under the Nazis.

00:03:47.095 --> 00:03:49.244
David Boder: Oh. So all of you told that you were older.

00:03:49.244 --> 00:03:50.438
Ludwig Hamburger: We told that we were older.

00:03:50.438 --> 00:03:52.494
David Boder: How old did you say you were?

00:03:52.494 --> 00:03:53.999
Ludwig Hamburger: I told them I was sixteen years old.

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:56.419
David Boder: Yes? And then?

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:01.883
Ludwig Hamburger: And then I was appointed to a work detail. Very hard for me.

00:04:01.883 --> 00:04:02.957
David Boder: What did you have to do?

00:04:02.957 --> 00:04:04.505
Ludwig Hamburger: I worked in a quarry.

00:04:04.505 --> 00:04:07.357
David Boder: Yes? How did you work in the quarry?

00:04:07.357 --> 00:04:09.346
Ludwig Hamburger: The stones were simply bigger than myself.

00:04:09.346 --> 00:04:10.864
David Boder: Yes?

00:04:10.864 --> 00:04:17.166
Ludwig Hamburger: And with clubs...with the beatings, with hollering all day long... We worked sixteen hours a day.

00:04:17.166 --> 00:04:22.515
David Boder: And what kind of tools did you use? [Pause.] What did you break the stones with?

00:04:22.515 --> 00:04:24.476
Ludwig Hamburger: With the hand. Oh, no. We carried them.

00:04:24.476 --> 00:04:24.958
David Boder: Oh, you carried the stones.

00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.694
Ludwig Hamburger: Carried...

00:04:26.694 --> 00:04:27.760
David Boder: Well.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:37.178
Ludwig Hamburger: And the SS, the guards, they always chased us like dogs, like animals with their rifles [?]. They beat us. That was their first [task?].... They had to...just so they could beat us.

00:04:37.178 --> 00:04:38.575
David Boder: Well...

00:04:38.575 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: And so we worked sixteen hours a day, one can say, without food.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:04:44.650
David Boder: Nu.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.257
Ludwig Hamburger: We received daily a piece of bread made of old flour, and one simply couldn’t stand it [digest it].

00:04:50.257 --> 00:04:50.528
David Boder: Yes.

00:04:50.528 --> 00:04:50.982
Ludwig Hamburger: Water...

00:04:50.982 --> 00:04:51.293
David Boder: Yes.

00:04:51.293 --> 00:04:52.888
Ludwig Hamburger: ...and a half litre of soup.

00:04:52.888 --> 00:04:54.513
David Boder: Yes, nu.

00:04:54.513 --> 00:04:55.740
Ludwig Hamburger: These were the rations.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.739
David Boder: Yes. And where was that?

00:04:57.739 --> 00:04:59.377
Ludwig Hamburger: This was in Auschwitz, at the beginning in Auschwitz.

00:04:59.377 --> 00:05:00.433
David Boder: This was in Auschwitz?

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:01.185
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes.

00:05:01.185 --> 00:05:05.097
David Boder: And did your parents go to Auschwitz together with you?

00:05:05.097 --> 00:05:07.615
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes, we went together in the car.

00:05:07.615 --> 00:05:09.062
David Boder: Railway...

00:05:09.062 --> 00:05:12.834
Ludwig Hamburger: In the railway car, and then in Auschwitz we were separated.

00:05:12.834 --> 00:05:18.915
David Boder: Oh, you were separated in Auschwitz? And what were you told when they separated you from your parents?

00:05:18.915 --> 00:05:22.359
Ludwig Hamburger: No, they didn’t tell anything. They were very much afraid...

00:05:22.359 --> 00:05:22.509
David Boder: Yes.

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:24.618
Ludwig Hamburger: ...to say anthing. We saw the men...

00:05:24.618 --> 00:05:24.904
David Boder: Yes.

00:05:24.904 --> 00:05:27.853
Ludwig Hamburger: ...with the clubs, with the dogs, everything, and...

00:05:27.853 --> 00:05:30.079
David Boder: What kind of dogs?

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:32.005
Ludwig Hamburger: Well, very big dogs they had...

00:05:32.005 --> 00:05:32.276
David Boder: Yes.

00:05:32.276 --> 00:05:32.887
Ludwig Hamburger: They are called shepherd dogs.

00:05:32.887 --> 00:05:37.465
David Boder: The shepherd dogs. Why did they have dogs?

00:05:37.465 --> 00:05:46.342
Ludwig Hamburger: They had...One can’t say. They were always so set against us. They simply didn’t want to soil their hands on us, so they needed special dogs.

00:05:46.342 --> 00:05:48.538
David Boder: Uh huh. And what did the dogs do?

00:05:48.538 --> 00:05:50.374
Ludwig Hamburger: They were specially trained dogs...

00:05:50.374 --> 00:05:51.547
David Boder: Yes.

00:05:51.547 --> 00:06:01.271
Ludwig Hamburger: ...against people. When they noticed a prisoner’s uniform or detected a Jew, [word not clear] they immediately jumped on him, ready to tear him apart.

00:06:01.271 --> 00:06:05.584
David Boder: Aha. Well, were not the dogs on chains? Were not the dogs...

00:06:05.584 --> 00:06:12.753
Ludwig Hamburger: They were on chains. But they released them at will when they saw that a Jew in some way...

00:06:12.753 --> 00:06:15.163
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:15.163 --> 00:06:15.644
Ludwig Hamburger: ...acted [?]...

00:06:15.644 --> 00:06:23.317
David Boder: Yes. And...you were separated from your parents...in Auschwitz. And you never saw them again?

00:06:23.317 --> 00:06:23.898
Ludwig Hamburger: No.

00:06:23.898 --> 00:06:26.396
David Boder: And how long were you in Auschwitz?

00:06:26.396 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: I was in Auschwitz two months. Then I was sent on a...to a lager, Blechhammer [Footnote: The correct name is Blechhammer, meaning sheet-metal works, but it was pronounced Blechame.]. It is not far from Auschwitz. Blechhammer.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:06:36.529
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:37.934
Ludwig Hamburger: It is a branch of Auschwitz.

00:06:37.934 --> 00:06:38.489
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:38.489 --> 00:06:39.515
Ludwig Hamburger: It also stood under Auschwitz.

00:06:39.515 --> 00:06:40.007
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:40.007 --> 00:06:43.681
Ludwig Hamburger: There I worked at [not clear].

00:06:43.681 --> 00:06:44.704
David Boder: What did you do?

00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:46.108
Ludwig Hamburger: We carried machinery.

00:06:46.108 --> 00:06:46.570
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:47.807
Ludwig Hamburger: [ Word not clear] machinery.

00:06:47.807 --> 00:06:48.251
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:48.251 --> 00:06:50.709
Ludwig Hamburger: Mostly youngsters, fourteen years old.

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:51.976
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:51.976 --> 00:06:53.463
Ludwig Hamburger: There I went ‘to naught’. [That was my doom.]

00:06:53.463 --> 00:06:54.065
David Boder: What do you mean ‘to naught’?

00:06:54.065 --> 00:06:56.362
Ludwig Hamburger: I came there with twenty boys...

00:06:56.362 --> 00:06:56.763
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:56.763 --> 00:06:57.636
Ludwig Hamburger: ...from my town.

00:06:57.636 --> 00:06:57.980
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:58.903
Ludwig Hamburger: And three remained.

00:06:58.903 --> 00:06:59.637
David Boder: And three remained?

00:06:59.637 --> 00:07:04.423
Ludwig Hamburger: After four months.

00:07:04.423 --> 00:07:03.458
David Boder: What happened to the others?

00:07:03.458 --> 00:07:04.496
Ludwig Hamburger: The work was too hard.

00:07:04.496 --> 00:07:06.091
David Boder: What happened then?

00:07:06.091 --> 00:07:10.176
Ludwig Hamburger: They simply collapsed...collapsed at work.

00:07:10.176 --> 00:07:11.793
David Boder: And what did they do with them?

00:07:11.793 --> 00:07:14.940
Ludwig Hamburger: Thrown away like a sack!

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:21.630
David Boder: Now...that does not make sense. Tell me the details. Tell me, for instance, what does it mean ‘everyone collapsed’?

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.471
Ludwig Hamburger: The work was so hard. He was beaten.

00:07:23.471 --> 00:07:24.688
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:24.688 --> 00:07:29.455
Ludwig Hamburger: We didn’t eat. We didn’t have anything to eat, and we worked sixteen hours daily.

00:07:29.455 --> 00:07:30.157
David Boder: Nu...

00:07:30.157 --> 00:07:33.084
Ludwig Hamburger: Even the young strength could not take it. All of us were...

00:07:33.084 --> 00:07:35.173
David Boder: Now what happened to them?

00:07:35.173 --> 00:07:36.086
Ludwig Hamburger: At work...

00:07:36.086 --> 00:07:43.564
David Boder: Take one boy, for example, whom you remember and tell me exactly what happened to him. Well?

00:07:43.564 --> 00:07:47.015
Ludwig Hamburger: The boy suddenly, while carrying machinery...

00:07:47.015 --> 00:07:47.249
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:47.249 --> 00:07:48.646
Ludwig Hamburger: ...he said he had a headache.

00:07:48.646 --> 00:07:49.890
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:57.264
Ludwig Hamburger: He bent down, and we thought he is searching for something, and he went on [?] searching....And we said to him, ‘You, why don’t you get up?

00:07:57.264 --> 00:07:57.956
David Boder: Yes.

00:07:57.956 --> 00:07:59.491
Ludwig Hamburger: So we didn’t receive an answer any more.

00:07:59.491 --> 00:08:00.123
David Boder: Nu.

00:08:00.123 --> 00:08:02.740
Ludwig Hamburger: We looked him over, and he remained lying [there].

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.088
David Boder: He remained lying? Tell me, what was done with him?

00:08:05.088 --> 00:08:21.060
Ludwig Hamburger: Then the SS men....They came running and [we] wanted to lay him aside and to take him to the lager. So they said, ‘Leave him alone, this boy. He could not stand [?] the work. The same will happen to you.’

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:26.147
David Boder: And so, did the boy die then, or what happened to him?

00:08:26.147 --> 00:08:27.145
Ludwig Hamburger: He died.

00:08:27.145 --> 00:08:31.066
David Boder: He died. And so let’s go on. Where was that?

00:08:31.066 --> 00:08:32.017
Ludwig Hamburger: That was in Blechhammer.

00:08:32.017 --> 00:08:33.251
David Boder: In Blechhammer.

00:08:33.251 --> 00:08:33.853
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes.

00:08:33.853 --> 00:08:35.908
David Boder: Nu. How long were you in Blechhammer.

00:08:35.908 --> 00:08:37.933
Ludwig Hamburger: I was in Blechhammer two years.

00:08:37.933 --> 00:08:39.408
David Boder: Yes.

00:08:39.408 --> 00:08:44.322
Ludwig Hamburger: Then came the evacuation [?].

00:08:44.322 --> 00:08:46.046
David Boder: You were in Blechhammer two years.

00:08:46.046 --> 00:08:46.859
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes.

00:08:46.859 --> 00:08:52.675
David Boder: Tell me how a day passed there. What time did you get up and so forth.

00:08:52.675 --> 00:08:58.663
Ludwig Hamburger: And so, every day we were awakened at four or three...

00:08:58.663 --> 00:08:59.927
David Boder: Yes.

00:08:59.927 --> 00:09:04.922
Ludwig Hamburger: ...by the block elder, and to appell.

00:09:04.922 --> 00:09:05.554
David Boder: Yes.

00:09:05.554 --> 00:09:20.263
Ludwig Hamburger: The appell lasted variously....If one came late it lasted longer. The lager-leader came and report-leader and the block leader [?], and they received the report whether everything is in order.

00:09:20.263 --> 00:09:20.985
David Boder: Yes.

00:09:20.985 --> 00:09:27.084
Ludwig Hamburger: After that we returned to the blocks again and we received a litter hot water. This they called coffee.

00:09:27.084 --> 00:09:29.499
David Boder: Yes.

00:09:29.499 --> 00:09:35.043
Ludwig Hamburger: We were given a little piece of bread.

00:09:35.043 --> 00:09:35.464
David Boder: Yes.

00:09:35.464 --> 00:09:36.939
Ludwig Hamburger: The dry bread...

00:09:36.939 --> 00:09:37.149
David Boder: Yes.

00:09:37.149 --> 00:09:38.119
Ludwig Hamburger: ...and immediately to work.

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:38.801
David Boder: Yes.

00:09:38.801 --> 00:09:59.877
Ludwig Hamburger: But in winter [word not clear] dressed, one may say, in nothing. We had the striped suits with wooden...wooden [shores?] without shirts. [Sobs.] I suffered there so much. I myself had to wash my shirt. I didn’t have another one.

00:09:59.877 --> 00:10:02.443
David Boder: Well, to wash a shirt, that one can do.

00:10:02.443 --> 00:10:03.216
Ludwig Hamburger: It was winter.

00:10:03.216 --> 00:10:04.502
David Boder: Oh. Yes.

00:10:04.502 --> 00:10:10.647
Ludwig Hamburger: So I washed my shirt and went to work without a shirt, only in a thin jacket.

00:10:10.647 --> 00:10:12.899
David Boder: Yes.

00:10:12.899 --> 00:10:17.082
Ludwig Hamburger: But the only lucky thing was that we didn’t lose our courage.

00:10:17.082 --> 00:10:19.557
David Boder: ‘We didnt lose courage.’ How did that come about?

00:10:19.557 --> 00:10:22.382
Ludwig Hamburger: I always had in mind my parents.

00:10:22.382 --> 00:10:23.788
David Boder: Yes.

00:10:23.788 --> 00:10:32.420
Ludwig Hamburger: Many times, when a child, my parents told me many stories from books. I also read them myself.

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.990
David Boder: What kind of stories?

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:39.924
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes. I read it myself that one should not lose courage, and I always heard my mother’s words near me [?].

00:10:39.924 --> 00:10:41.361
David Boder: Yes.

00:10:41.361 --> 00:10:51.218
Ludwig Hamburger: Many times I was tired of life. I couldn’t stand it any more. I received once twenty-five blows...for nothing. An SS man stopped me.

00:10:51.218 --> 00:10:51.671
David Boder: Yes.

00:10:51.671 --> 00:10:57.846
Ludwig Hamburger: He asked me, ‘How much is three times seven?’ I said, ‘Twenty one.’ He stretch me out and gave me twenty -one blows.

00:10:57.846 --> 00:11:00.170
David Boder: Why?

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:15.611
Ludwig Hamburger: That cannot be explained [?]. He simply came over to me and said ‘Boy, can you figure?’ So I said, ‘Sure.’ So he said, ‘Tell me how much is three times seven?’ I answered him. So he said, ‘Come here,’ and he gave me ‘twenty-one’ for nothing.

00:11:15.611 --> 00:11:17.289
David Boder: Nu.

00:11:17.289 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: We went out ot work. It reained. The SS men well dressed, warmly. Winter...and we, frozen, hungry. There...inside there was [rest of sentence not clear]...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:11:36.606
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:36.606 --> 00:12:21.272
Ludwig Hamburger: I had a friend in the lager, and we shook hands every day and said, ‘Aufwiedersehen.’ None of us knew whether we shall see each other again. The supervisors [?], the foremen , were all murderers. They were the scum [?] of Germany. They beat us at work...for every-thing. For the least...[Sobs.] They...they beat us. They said we were saboteurs. And many friends, many of our comrades have lost their lives [?]. If they lost a screw, if they dropped something...it was too heavy for them...it was called sabotage and...murdered!!

00:12:21.272 --> 00:12:25.256
David Boder: Where did you work then?

00:12:25.256 --> 00:12:30.435
Ludwig Hamburger: We prisoners did any kind of work. Um. It was....We were put to do the worst jobs.

00:12:30.435 --> 00:12:31.401
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:31.401 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: Digging bunkers.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:12:32.611
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:32.611 --> 00:12:33.936
Ludwig Hamburger: Trenches [?].

00:12:33.936 --> 00:12:34.719
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:34.719 --> 00:12:35.924
Ludwig Hamburger: Excavations [?].

00:12:35.924 --> 00:12:36.737
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:36.737 --> 00:12:37.762
Ludwig Hamburger: In mines...

00:12:37.762 --> 00:12:38.149
David Boder: Hm.

00:12:38.149 --> 00:12:41.500
Ludwig Hamburger: ...where...where we were under the greatest hazards.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.174
David Boder: Yes. And this lasted how long?

00:12:44.174 --> 00:12:47.766
Ludwig Hamburger: This lasted all time time until the evacuation.

00:12:47.766 --> 00:12:49.598
David Boder: Now tell about the evacuation.

00:12:49.598 --> 00:12:52.748
Ludwig Hamburger: The Russians approached [he mispronounces the word].

00:12:52.748 --> 00:12:54.283
David Boder: Approached.

00:12:54.283 --> 00:12:58.751
Ludwig Hamburger: And it came that all of us had to be evacuated. It was on the twenty-first of December.

00:12:58.751 --> 00:12:59.112
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:59.112 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: It was very cold. Snow. Suddenly comes the order...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:13:04.469
David Boder: Hm.

00:13:04.469 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: ...’Step forward.’

00:00:00.000 --> 00:13:06.443
David Boder: Hm.

00:13:06.443 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: We are going. Where? Nobody knows. We got up. Everybody took a blanket...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:13:13.033
David Boder: Hm.

00:13:13.033 --> 00:13:18.118
Ludwig Hamburger: ...a thin blanket, a bread, a piece of butter.

00:13:18.118 --> 00:13:18.810
David Boder: Butter?

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:21.106
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes. The only time! Margarine.

00:13:21.106 --> 00:13:22.060
David Boder: Margarine.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.730
Ludwig Hamburger: Ha ha... We said butter.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:24.242
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:24.242 --> 00:13:25.700
Ludwig Hamburger: We didn’t know any other expression.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:26.412
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:26.412 --> 00:13:28.465
Ludwig Hamburger: It tasted then better than butter for us.

00:13:28.465 --> 00:13:29.630
David Boder: Nu.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:40.248
Ludwig Hamburger: We went out. The snow was very deep [high]. Wind, frost...We left, four thousand people, from Blechhammer.

00:13:40.248 --> 00:13:42.421
David Boder: What do you call it? Blechhammer [mispronounced: Blechame]?

00:13:42.421 --> 00:13:44.142
Ludwig Hamburger: From Blechhammer.

00:13:44.142 --> 00:13:46.454
David Boder: Blechhammer. Yes. Nu.

00:13:46.454 --> 00:13:48.464
Ludwig Hamburger: Direction, Gleiwitz.

00:13:48.464 --> 00:13:49.618
David Boder: What? Gleiwitz?

00:13:49.618 --> 00:13:50.431
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes. In Upper Silesia.

00:13:50.431 --> 00:13:51.124
David Boder: Marching on foot all the time?

00:13:51.124 --> 00:13:52.660
Ludwig Hamburger: All the time on foot.

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:53.503
David Boder: Yes.

00:13:53.503 --> 00:14:05.955
Ludwig Hamburger: And so, the first hours were still tolerable. We ran. But farther on it became worse. We marched at night as well. Still it was lucky.

00:14:05.955 --> 00:14:08.191
David Boder: Your marched at night? Yes?

00:14:08.191 --> 00:14:16.417
Ludwig Hamburger: We marched at night. Many times, when they couldn’t any more, they chased us into a barn...in a barn, four thousand people.

00:14:16.417 --> 00:14:18.377
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:18.377 --> 00:14:34.946
Ludwig Hamburger: It was terrible, indeed. The SS men were around. They were strongly armed. We were chased inside. There was very little room, so that one climbed on top of the other. When we came out in the morning, many comrades remained behind.

00:14:34.946 --> 00:14:36.423
David Boder: What does it mean, ‘remained behind’?

00:14:36.423 --> 00:14:38.413
Ludwig Hamburger: We ourselves have trampled them to death.

00:14:38.413 --> 00:14:40.705
David Boder: Yes. In the barn.

00:14:40.705 --> 00:14:45.227
Ludwig Hamburger: With only...with our own feet have we trampled our brothers to death.

00:14:45.227 --> 00:14:46.946
David Boder: Hm.

00:14:46.946 --> 00:14:53.948
Ludwig Hamburger: Everyday it became worse. The bread had ended. No water. I wanted once to drink a little bit of water at a well. It was near Rabibor [Raciborz].

00:14:53.948 --> 00:14:55.712
David Boder: Yes.

00:14:55.712 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: So an SS man came over to me and hit me with the rifle over the [part of body not clear] that I simply doubled over [?].

00:00:00.000 --> 00:15:02.632
David Boder: Hm.

00:15:02.632 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: For a tiny little bit of water.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:15:06.175
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:06.175 --> 00:15:09.778
Ludwig Hamburger: We went farther till we all came to Grossrosen. The way...

00:15:09.778 --> 00:15:10.924
David Boder: Grossrosen?

00:15:10.924 --> 00:15:11.391
Ludwig Hamburger: Grossrosen

00:15:11.391 --> 00:15:12.718
David Boder: Where is Grossrosen?

00:15:12.718 --> 00:15:13.819
Ludwig Hamburger: Near Breslau.

00:15:13.819 --> 00:15:15.492
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:15.492 --> 00:15:30.493
Ludwig Hamburger: It is....The road, from Blachhammer to Grossrosen, that was a road of many deaths. We arrived in Grossrosen. From four thousand people, we arrived two hundred and eighty.

00:15:30.493 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: What does that mean?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: We were...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:15:33.372
David Boder: What has become of the others?

00:15:33.372 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: Shot...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:15:34.940
David Boder: But...

00:15:34.940 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: In the barn we...in the barn we ourselves have trumpled them to death.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:15:39.523
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:39.523 --> 00:15:42.779
Ludwig Hamburger: And so, the bread....We ran for seven days.

00:15:42.779 --> 00:15:43.443
David Boder: Yes.

00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:45.961
Ludwig Hamburger: The bread lasted...lasted for three days.

00:15:45.961 --> 00:15:47.363
David Boder: Hm, and then...you didn’t get...

00:15:47.363 --> 00:15:48.931
Ludwig Hamburger: And then we received nothing.

00:15:48.931 --> 00:15:51.177
David Boder: And?

00:15:51.177 --> 00:16:02.755
Ludwig Hamburger: [ Laughing.] It is indeed hard to believe. We ourselves don’t believe it any more. How can one survive seven days on one bread? Without water. It was lucky that we had snow. We had...we ate the snow.

00:16:02.755 --> 00:16:03.780
David Boder: Hm.

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:04.986
Ludwig Hamburger: Instead of water.

00:16:04.986 --> 00:16:05.891
David Boder: Yes.

00:16:05.891 --> 00:16:08.589
Ludwig Hamburger: We arrived...

00:16:08.589 --> 00:16:20.167
David Boder: And so, tell me more about the journey. Say the night you spent in a barn. Well, then you got up. What happened then?

00:16:20.167 --> 00:16:21.735
Ludwig Hamburger: Then we ran. Always on foot.

00:16:21.735 --> 00:16:24.027
David Boder: And the SS men also walked?

00:16:24.027 --> 00:16:27.238
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes. The SS men walked, but they rotated.

00:16:27.238 --> 00:16:28.761
David Boder: What do you mean? Where did the others remain?

00:16:28.761 --> 00:16:30.133
Ludwig Hamburger: They traveled in cars.

00:16:30.133 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: Oh. You mean some traveled in cars, others marched on foot.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:16:33.736
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes.

00:16:33.736 --> 00:16:39.766
David Boder: What happened during the march? Tell me about specific cases.

00:16:39.766 --> 00:16:45.193
Ludwig Hamburger: When we left we were still in a good mood [?]. We thought that the Russians were close.

00:16:45.193 --> 00:16:45.947
David Boder: Aha.

00:16:45.947 --> 00:16:47.424
Ludwig Hamburger: That the liberation has come.

00:16:47.424 --> 00:16:47.997
David Boder: Yes.

00:16:47.997 --> 00:16:51.465
Ludwig Hamburger: We heard the shooting and we said, ‘Thanks, God. We are already liberated.’

00:16:51.465 --> 00:16:52.445
David Boder: Hm.

00:16:52.445 --> 00:17:03.209
Ludwig Hamburger: But then, when we noticed that it was getting ever quieter, we continue marching, nothing in sight, then our will went totally kaputt. We became morally exhausted.

00:17:03.209 --> 00:17:03.842
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:03.842 --> 00:17:18.676
Ludwig Hamburger: We had no more faith in anything. Hope was lost. We lost every-thing. We said, ‘We were so near to...so near were we to the happy day of liberation, and again it has failed [?].’ We thought fate wants us to perish.

00:17:18.676 --> 00:17:20.395
David Boder: Yes, nun.

00:17:20.395 --> 00:17:29.636
Ludwig Hamburger: And with many the will....They said, ‘Now I’m not going through with it.’ They ate up their bread in the first day. They wanted at once to sated. They said, ‘To die...”

00:17:29.636 --> 00:17:30.360
David Boder: Yes.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.631
Ludwig Hamburger: Our only wish was to die sated.

00:17:33.631 --> 00:17:36.948
David Boder: Hm, nu.

00:17:36.948 --> 00:17:37.988
Ludwig Hamburger: And...

00:17:37.988 --> 00:17:39.043
David Boder: To die sated?

00:17:39.043 --> 00:17:39.556
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes.

00:17:39.556 --> 00:17:40.038
David Boder: Nu.

00:17:40.038 --> 00:17:53.214
Ludwig Hamburger: They ate it up, but they ran ahead. The cold was terrible. And they said, ‘We can’t any more.’ So they sat down, and the SS men asked...and asked, ‘why are you sitting down?’ So he says, ‘I can’t any more.’ He shot him.

00:17:53.214 --> 00:17:55.657
David Boder: He shot him. Did you see it yourself?

00:17:55.657 --> 00:18:03.391
Ludwig Hamburger: Everybody saw it themselves. The road from Blechhammer to Grossrosen was strewn with dead. Every ten or fifteen meters, a corpse.

00:18:03.391 --> 00:18:10.552
David Boder: Nu. And how then did you go? Tell about yourself. How did you...How did you get through?

00:18:10.552 --> 00:18:12.527
Ludwig Hamburger: I had a friend.

00:18:12.527 --> 00:18:12.994
David Boder: Yes.

00:18:12.994 --> 00:18:16.432
Ludwig Hamburger: We always marched together. We both...held on [to each other?].

00:18:16.432 --> 00:18:17.744
David Boder: Where is the friend now?

00:18:17.744 --> 00:18:18.814
Ludwig Hamburger: The friend is here.

00:18:18.814 --> 00:18:20.412
David Boder: He is here? Nu. And so?

00:18:20.412 --> 00:18:35.277
Ludwig Hamburger: We always maintained the will [?] to endure [?]... We said, ‘No. Now we shall endure it. We are already three years... We have already endured three year, so it will last another year. We shall endure it. If we have endured that, we shall endure this to the end.’

00:18:35.277 --> 00:18:35.744
David Boder: Hm.

00:18:35.744 --> 00:18:38.609
Ludwig Hamburger: Like one, so the other. We always cheered up one another.

00:18:38.609 --> 00:18:39.559
David Boder: Hm.

00:18:39.559 --> 00:18:43.373
Ludwig Hamburger: We rationed our bread. We washed ourselves with snow.

00:18:43.373 --> 00:18:44.428
David Boder: Hm.

00:18:44.428 --> 00:18:57.484
Ludwig Hamburger: Many of us had their hands frozen, the legs. We washed our hands and feet every day with snow. We knew it yet from home, that it is the only thing against frost and [word not clear].

00:18:57.484 --> 00:18:58.615
David Boder: Against what?

00:18:58.615 --> 00:18:59.414
Ludwig Hamburger: Against the frost.

00:18:59.414 --> 00:19:00.213
David Boder: And against what?

00:19:00.213 --> 00:19:01.193
Ludwig Hamburger: [ He repeats the second word, but it is still not clear on the wire.]

00:19:01.193 --> 00:19:02.655
David Boder: [ Repetition also not clear.] Nu.

00:19:02.655 --> 00:19:09.319
Ludwig Hamburger: We have.... We rejoiced together. We gave each other support and we...everything.... We told one another stories from home.

00:19:09.319 --> 00:19:10.118
David Boder: Hm.

00:19:10.118 --> 00:19:16.435
Ludwig Hamburger: So was the journey.... On the whole journey we talked to each other. We had memories of our parents. We had them so beautiful.

00:19:16.435 --> 00:19:17.445
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:17.445 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: We reminded ourselves of the hours when we were still at home and the school and everything. We said, ‘It is impossible that all this should have passed forever. It will surely come back again,’

00:00:00.000 --> 00:19:31.435
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:31.435 --> 00:19:32.912
Ludwig Hamburger: And so we marched until Grossrosen.

00:19:32.912 --> 00:19:33.576
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:33.576 --> 00:19:37.028
Ludwig Hamburger: In Grossrosen...we suffered the worst yet.

00:19:37.028 --> 00:19:37.661
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:37.661 --> 00:19:39.470
Ludwig Hamburger: It was.... It was not a KZ.

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:40.134
David Boder: What?

00:19:40.134 --> 00:19:42.893
Ludwig Hamburger: It was not a KZ. A KZ.looked too good.

00:19:42.893 --> 00:19:43.722
David Boder: What is a KZ [Ka-Zet]?

00:19:43.722 --> 00:19:44.566
Ludwig Hamburger: Concentration camp. [Konzentrazions lager.]

00:19:44.566 --> 00:19:47.792
David Boder: Yes, hm.

00:19:47.792 --> 00:19:50.868
Ludwig Hamburger: [ Pause - tearful voice:] It was simply not to endure. Worse yet than Auschwitz.

00:19:50.868 --> 00:19:52.421
David Boder: For instance?

00:19:52.421 --> 00:19:58.738
Ludwig Hamburger: We were chased, four thousand people into a house about a hundred and fifty meters square.

00:19:58.738 --> 00:19:59.808
David Boder: Yes.

00:19:59.808 --> 00:20:08.190
Ludwig Hamburger: One lay on top of the other, sat or stood and received nothing to eat. Absolutely nothing!

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:09.034
David Boder: Hm.

00:20:09.034 --> 00:20:18.532
Ludwig Hamburger: Mornings from four o’clock till ten in the evening we stood outdoors - - appell - without moving.

00:20:18.532 --> 00:20:22.316
David Boder: Yes. Why.... How come the appell lasted for so long?

00:20:22.316 --> 00:20:25.316
Ludwig Hamburger: It was an extermination camp, directly aimed [?] at extermination.

00:20:25.316 --> 00:20:29.839
David Boder: Now tell me, for instance, you came out. Where did you stand?

00:20:29.839 --> 00:20:32.085
Ludwig Hamburger: There were many SS men.

00:20:32.085 --> 00:20:32.628
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:32.628 --> 00:20:34.874
Ludwig Hamburger: The worst, one can say, that I lived through [met].

00:20:34.874 --> 00:20:35.477
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:35.477 --> 00:20:37.497
Ludwig Hamburger: All at once they rushed into the block...

00:20:37.497 --> 00:20:38.131
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:38.131 --> 00:20:41.191
Ludwig Hamburger: ...with clubs and started to beat and to call, ‘Appell.’

00:20:41.191 --> 00:20:41.583
David Boder: Hm.

00:20:41.583 --> 00:20:53.463
Ludwig Hamburger: We ran. We came outside. They started to count. If one was missing, or was a few minutes late, or one didn’t stamd straight,...

00:20:53.463 --> 00:20:54.021
David Boder: Yes.

00:20:54.021 --> 00:20:57.895
Ludwig Hamburger: ...and it was always so, that, according to them, nobody was standing straight.

00:20:57.895 --> 00:20:58.348
David Boder: Nu.

00:20:58.348 --> 00:21:01.197
Ludwig Hamburger: So we had to stand two hours for every man.

00:21:01.197 --> 00:21:02.041
David Boder: Hm.

00:21:02.041 --> 00:21:06.353
Ludwig Hamburger: We had once.... We stood once for twenty-four hours without moving.

00:21:06.353 --> 00:21:07.770
David Boder: Day and night?

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:13.710
Ludwig Hamburger: A day and night, because three had remained lying in the block. They couldn’t any more...

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:14.599
David Boder: Nu.

00:21:14.599 --> 00:21:17.735
Ludwig Hamburger: For twenty-four hours.

00:21:17.735 --> 00:21:18.670
David Boder: what does it mean ‘remained lying’? They fainted or what?

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:20.434
Ludwig Hamburger: They had no more strength left to stand.

00:21:20.434 --> 00:21:21.926
David Boder: Nu, so what happened?

00:21:21.926 --> 00:21:25.605
Ludwig Hamburger: We said, ‘You can do anything you want with me. I have...I have no more strength.

00:21:25.605 --> 00:21:27.399
David Boder: Nu. What was done with them?

00:21:27.399 --> 00:21:31.876
Ludwig Hamburger: They were beaten to death inside the block, and we had to stand twenty-four hours.

00:21:31.876 --> 00:21:33.324
David Boder: They were what?

00:21:33.324 --> 00:21:35.269
Ludwig Hamburger: Beaten to death. Not only...

00:21:35.269 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: What does that mean? Beaten to death with what?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: With cudgels.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:21:36.611
David Boder: Who did it?

00:21:36.611 --> 00:21:38.164
Ludwig Hamburger: The block elder.

00:21:38.164 --> 00:21:39.506
David Boder: Was he a Jew?

00:21:39.506 --> 00:21:40.154
Ludwig Hamburger: No

00:21:40.154 --> 00:21:40.727
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:40.727 --> 00:21:42.838
Ludwig Hamburger: In Auschwitz, in Grossrosen...

00:21:42.838 --> 00:21:43.878
David Boder: Yes.

00:21:43.878 --> 00:21:48.220
Ludwig Hamburger: ...there were the ‘green’ - - what they were called. With the green triangles. Professional criminals.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:50.587
David Boder: The professional criminals. They were the block elders.

00:21:50.587 --> 00:21:55.306
Ludwig Hamburger: They were in concentration camps for fifteen years, for twenty years.

00:21:55.306 --> 00:21:56.467
David Boder: In prison. The lagers were not that old.

00:21:56.467 --> 00:22:01.306
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes, yes. In prisons. And then they came...and the beating...

00:22:01.306 --> 00:22:01.970
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:06.915
Ludwig Hamburger: ...the way they used to beat.

00:22:06.915 --> 00:22:03.885
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:03.885 --> 00:22:06.960
Ludwig Hamburger: And that they...that they tortured us so.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:07.548
David Boder: Yes.

00:22:07.548 --> 00:22:09.282
Ludwig Hamburger: That is why they became capos and elders.

00:22:09.282 --> 00:22:11.377
David Boder: Hm. [Pause.] Nu?

00:22:11.377 --> 00:22:23.438
Ludwig Hamburger: And when a block elder or a capo had beaten to death a prisoner, whether a Jew, a Czech, a Pole, or any other nationality, he received a commendation. He received a bread for it.

00:22:23.438 --> 00:22:24.629
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:24.629 --> 00:22:27.327
Ludwig Hamburger: I have once lived through a case. It was in Auschwitz.

00:22:27.327 --> 00:22:28.865
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:28.865 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: We left for the stone quarry.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:22:31.850
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:31.850 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: Then it was so, that every SS man who had beaten to death a prisoner...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:22:36.644
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:36.644 --> 00:22:42.795
Ludwig Hamburger: ...received twenty-five...eh...marks...Reichsmarks and five days leave.

00:22:42.795 --> 00:22:45.373
David Boder: And so why didn’t he beat someone to death every day?

00:22:45.373 --> 00:22:48.343
Ludwig Hamburger: He had to have a reason for it.

00:22:48.343 --> 00:22:49.715
David Boder: Oh. He had to have...

00:22:49.715 --> 00:22:52.926
Ludwig Hamburger: He had to have certain grounds. So he connived with the capo...

00:22:52.926 --> 00:22:54.283
David Boder: Hm.

00:22:54.283 --> 00:22:59.876
Ludwig Hamburger: At work we had a fence of...from the sand heap...

00:22:59.876 --> 00:23:00.554
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:00.554 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: ...up to here we could go.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:23:02.936
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:02.936 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: Whoever crosses this border gets shot.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:23:06.012
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:06.012 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: Then the SS man made it up with the capo so that the capo receives a package of tobacco...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:23:13.685
David Boder: Hm.

00:23:13.685 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: ...so that the capo should send him out, Jew or a...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:23:17.092
David Boder: Hm. Yes.

00:23:17.092 --> 00:23:22.851
Ludwig Hamburger: Then the capo saw...took.... I myself witnessed it. I saw it myself from a distance of five meters. He called over a Jew...

00:23:22.851 --> 00:23:23.726
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:23.726 --> 00:23:24.977
Ludwig Hamburger: ...and older man...

00:23:24.977 --> 00:23:25.460
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:27.254
Ludwig Hamburger: ...and he took off his cap...

00:23:27.254 --> 00:23:27.721
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:27.721 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: ...and threw it over...over the fence.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:23:30.349
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:30.349 --> 00:23:32.576
Ludwig Hamburger: There was no fence yet. There were only a few markers [?] on the ground...

00:23:32.576 --> 00:23:33.425
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:33.425 --> 00:23:34.978
Ludwig Hamburger: ...and said, ‘Go fetch the cap.’

00:23:34.978 --> 00:23:35.777
David Boder: Yes.

00:23:35.777 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: And he said, ‘How can I fetch the cap? When I cross the border I’ll get shot.’ So he says, ‘Nobody is there. Go and fetch it.’

00:00:00.000 --> 00:23:43.889
David Boder: Hm.

00:23:43.889 --> 00:23:52.383
Ludwig Hamburger: He didn’t want to. Then he said, ‘If you don’t go, I’ll kill you. And he began to beat him. Then he went. The SS man was hidden behind a tree...

00:23:52.383 --> 00:23:53.046
David Boder: Hm.

00:23:53.046 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: ...and when he crossed the ‘fence’...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: Hm.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:23:57.472
Ludwig Hamburger: ...he immediately shot him.

00:23:57.472 --> 00:23:57.743
David Boder: Oh!

00:23:57.743 --> 00:23:58.165
Ludwig Hamburger: The SS man said...

00:23:58.165 --> 00:24:01.175
David Boder: He said that was the reason. He was shot while trying to escape.

00:24:01.175 --> 00:24:02.081
Ludwig Hamburger: No! [Both speak together.]

00:24:02.081 --> 00:24:04.778
David Boder: Well, he said he wanted to run away.

00:24:04.778 --> 00:24:11.049
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes, yes. And the SS man received twenty-five Reichsmarks and five days leave, and the capo received a package of tobacco.

00:24:11.049 --> 00:24:12.406
David Boder: Aha.

00:24:12.406 --> 00:24:31.021
Ludwig Hamburger: Our life...was nothing! The capos played [tricks on] us. They took our bread away from us although we had very little ourselves. They took our soup away. The soup was emptier [?] [than water?]. The soup was everything. Without the little bit of bread and without the soup we were quite lost.

00:24:31.021 --> 00:24:36.177
David Boder: Nu. And so you were there in that lager, what was it called?

00:24:36.177 --> 00:24:36.961
Ludwig Hamburger: Grossrosen [distinctly].

00:24:36.961 --> 00:24:37.850
David Boder: Grossrosen, nu.

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:38.996
Ludwig Hamburger: Near Breslau.

00:24:38.996 --> 00:24:39.720
David Boder: And so?

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:42.780
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes. We saw this will be the end of the road.

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:43.278
David Boder: Yes?

00:24:43.278 --> 00:24:47.770
Ludwig Hamburger: From here we won’t get out any more. The crematory burned day and night.

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:49.580
David Boder: Yes. Was there a crematory?

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:50.138
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes.

00:24:50.138 --> 00:24:50.620
David Boder: Yes?

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:52.278
Ludwig Hamburger: In every concentration camp. [Not clear. Speaking together.]

00:24:52.278 --> 00:24:53.726
David Boder: Yes.

00:24:53.726 --> 00:25:00.404
Ludwig Hamburger: It was like this. If anybody.... In Auschwitz...in Auschwitz...

00:25:00.404 --> 00:25:01.912
David Boder: If anybody in Auschwitz...? Yes.

00:25:01.912 --> 00:25:08.862
Ludwig Hamburger: In Auschwitz the crematory has - - it is an unbelievable number - - has burned four million people! Mostly Jews! [Not clear. Speaking together.]

00:25:08.862 --> 00:25:10.535
David Boder: Who counted that?

00:25:10.535 --> 00:25:12.194
Ludwig Hamburger: The statistics tell.

00:25:12.194 --> 00:25:15.797
David Boder: Hm. Nu?

00:25:15.797 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: [ Pause.] Mostly Jews, Hungarians...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:25:18.872
David Boder: Hm.

00:25:18.872 --> 00:25:23.214
Ludwig Hamburger: ...Poles, French, and Dutch.

00:25:23.214 --> 00:25:24.480
David Boder: Were there no Russians?

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:29.154
Ludwig Hamburger: Also. And so all nationalities. There were Englishmen.

00:25:29.154 --> 00:25:30.435
David Boder: Yes?

00:25:30.435 --> 00:25:35.651
Ludwig Hamburger: There were Americans. There were Swiss, black, red, all colors...had there.

00:25:35.651 --> 00:25:37.702
David Boder: Hm.

00:25:37.702 --> 00:25:42.270
Ludwig Hamburger: And the crematory was Birkenau. It was not far from Auschwitz.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:43.190
David Boder: How far?

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:57.768
Ludwig Hamburger: A few kilometers from Auschwitz. There the large crematory stood. [Pause. With feeling:] It burned by day and night! Transports came every day of forty, fifty thousand. People from the evacuations... [The statistics may sound somewhat figurative but are not entirely impossible.]

00:25:57.768 --> 00:25:58.627
David Boder: Hm.

00:25:58.627 --> 00:26:07.612
Ludwig Hamburger: From Hungary a transport of sixty thousand people came. So he took out the strongest, really the strongest...

00:26:07.612 --> 00:26:08.758
David Boder: Hm.

00:26:08.758 --> 00:26:43.145
Ludwig Hamburger: ...there were a hundred or two hundred and to the others he said, ‘You are going to wash up.’ [With feeling:] Nobody knew what was up. We were divided into small groups, ‘left, right, left, right.’ In the middle stood an SS man, a doctor, and we had to pass through, and so undressed to the waist. With white gloves, dressed nicely, and he laughed like in a theater play, and with the index finger he pointed at us, ‘left, right, left, right.’ Nobody knew what means left and nobody knew what means right.

00:26:43.145 --> 00:26:44.426
David Boder: Were you personally present?

00:26:44.426 --> 00:26:45.090
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes.

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:45.799
David Boder: Yes?

00:26:45.799 --> 00:26:49.613
Ludwig Hamburger: Unfortunately that left meant [words not clear].

00:26:49.613 --> 00:26:54.950
David Boder: And so where did you go from...from this place?

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:55.417
Ludwig Hamburger: From this place...

00:26:55.417 --> 00:26:58.463
David Boder: From the lager where you were, that you told me about.

00:26:58.463 --> 00:26:59.443
Ludwig Hamburger: You mean from Grossrosen?

00:26:59.443 --> 00:27:01.086
David Boder: Yes, from Grossrosen.

00:27:01.086 --> 00:27:05.488
Ludwig Hamburger: From Grossrosen...we were transported to Buchenwald.

00:27:05.488 --> 00:27:06.845
David Boder: Why?

00:27:06.845 --> 00:27:09.408
Ludwig Hamburger: The Russians approached. They were already near Breslau.

00:27:09.408 --> 00:27:12.016
David Boder: And how were you transported to Buchenwald?

00:27:12.016 --> 00:27:13.704
Ludwig Hamburger: In open freight cars by railroad.

00:27:13.704 --> 00:27:15.936
David Boder: In which month was that?

00:27:15.936 --> 00:27:21.288
Ludwig Hamburger: It was exactly...the third of February.

00:27:21.288 --> 00:27:24.378
David Boder: February. And so you were transported in open RR-cars to Buchenwald.

00:27:24.378 --> 00:27:24.801
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes.

00:27:24.801 --> 00:27:28.103
David Boder: Nu? How many days did you travel?

00:27:28.103 --> 00:27:31.284
Ludwig Hamburger: Thus, on the ninth of February we were in Buchenwald.

00:27:31.284 --> 00:27:31.962
David Boder: Nu?

00:27:31.962 --> 00:27:32.746
Ludwig Hamburger: In Weimar.

00:27:32.746 --> 00:27:34.465
David Boder: Yes?

00:27:34.465 --> 00:27:36.048
Ludwig Hamburger: There we went through the bombardment.

00:27:36.048 --> 00:27:38.234
David Boder: How come? The Americans?

00:27:38.234 --> 00:27:38.792
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes.

00:27:38.792 --> 00:27:39.501
David Boder: Yes.

00:27:39.501 --> 00:27:51.576
Ludwig Hamburger: The Americans came, and it was on the ninth of February when they bombed Weimar. We were on the train...on the...on the...station, and the American airplanes arrived.

00:27:51.576 --> 00:27:53.084
David Boder: Yes?

00:27:53.084 --> 00:28:04.828
Ludwig Hamburger: We said, ‘For God’s sake! Men, don’t you recognized us [?]?’ And nobody knew that we are here.

00:28:04.828 --> 00:28:06.351
David Boder: Yes?

00:28:06.351 --> 00:28:12.879
Ludwig Hamburger: They began to bomb, but luckily we were...we only lost four comrades.

00:28:12.879 --> 00:28:14.583
David Boder: Hm.

00:28:14.583 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: One could not believe [?] it today. The bombs fell three meters from us. A bomb fell two meters away from me so that I was under the...under the cloud that formed over me.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:28:23.734
David Boder: Yes?

00:28:23.734 --> 00:28:26.101
Ludwig Hamburger: I was completely covered with debris, but nothing happened to me.

00:28:26.101 --> 00:28:27.021
David Boder: You were on the railroad station?

00:28:27.021 --> 00:28:28.122
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes, yes.

00:28:28.122 --> 00:28:28.710
David Boder: Nu?

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:29.750
Ludwig Hamburger: Then it passed...

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:32.765
David Boder: And where did the SS remain when this happened?

00:28:32.765 --> 00:28:33.609
Ludwig Hamburger: They were with us.

00:28:33.609 --> 00:28:35.961
David Boder: Hm.

00:28:35.961 --> 00:28:38.569
Ludwig Hamburger: We came to Blechhammer [correcting himself] to Buchenwald.

00:28:38.569 --> 00:28:39.805
David Boder: Hm.

00:28:39.805 --> 00:29:03.067
Ludwig Hamburger: In Buchenwald...[pause]...we arrived in the evening, hungry. We received nothing, not even bread, only one bread [during] six days of travel on the [word not clear] ...on the railroad...and we came to Buchenwald. It was like every other concentration camp, but one thing was better.

00:29:03.067 --> 00:29:03.866
David Boder: Yes.

00:29:03.866 --> 00:29:06.926
Ludwig Hamburger: There we were comrades. There we had only on enemy...

00:29:06.926 --> 00:29:07.590
David Boder: Yes?

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:08.691
Ludwig Hamburger: ...the SS.

00:29:08.691 --> 00:29:09.430
David Boder: Yes.

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:10.229
Ludwig Hamburger: Buchenwald...

00:29:10.229 --> 00:29:13.350
David Boder: How is that? What kind of enemies did you have elsewhere?

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:17.043
Ludwig Hamburger: In Auschwitz we had the capos and the block elders, the greens.

00:29:17.043 --> 00:29:17.466
David Boder: Aha.

00:29:17.466 --> 00:29:18.567
Ludwig Hamburger: The professional criminals.

00:29:18.567 --> 00:29:19.456
David Boder: And in Buchenwald?

00:29:19.456 --> 00:29:21.054
Ludwig Hamburger: In Buchenwald there were political prisoners.

00:29:21.054 --> 00:29:23.044
David Boder: Yes? Nu?

00:29:23.044 --> 00:29:28.230
Ludwig Hamburger: The political [prisoners] said that we were all brothers. There were no exceptions [distinctions between].

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.803
David Boder: Hm

00:29:28.803 --> 00:29:30.793
Ludwig Hamburger: Between Jews and Arians...

00:29:30.793 --> 00:29:31.758
David Boder: Yes?

00:29:31.758 --> 00:29:36.688
Ludwig Hamburger: ...between a Negro and a White. They were all the same.

00:29:36.688 --> 00:29:37.577
David Boder: Together.

00:29:37.577 --> 00:29:38.723
Ludwig Hamburger: They made the same victims.

00:29:38.723 --> 00:29:39.025
David Boder: Yes?

00:29:39.025 --> 00:29:40.759
Ludwig Hamburger: We had one enemy, the SS.

00:29:40.759 --> 00:29:41.468
David Boder: Yes?

00:29:41.468 --> 00:29:42.960
Ludwig Hamburger: And against them we had to fight.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.498
David Boder: Nu?

00:29:44.498 --> 00:29:47.875
Ludwig Hamburger: So that it was...a great relief for us.

00:29:47.875 --> 00:29:48.780
David Boder: Yes?

00:29:48.780 --> 00:30:00.222
Ludwig Hamburger: In Buchenwald...the fact that we live today, the majority of the youth - - we are to be grateful to the lager elder.

00:30:00.222 --> 00:30:01.338
David Boder: Who was he?

00:30:01.338 --> 00:30:02.861
Ludwig Hamburger: He was an Austrian.

00:30:02.861 --> 00:30:04.384
David Boder: Yes?

00:30:04.384 --> 00:30:05.726
Ludwig Hamburger: He really sacrificed himself.

00:30:05.726 --> 00:30:06.555
David Boder: Was he a prisoner?

00:30:06.555 --> 00:30:07.249
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes.

00:30:07.249 --> 00:30:08.711
David Boder: Yes.

00:30:08.711 --> 00:30:15.736
Ludwig Hamburger: He really sacrificed himself so as to keep us together and to give us a feeling of comradeship.

00:30:15.736 --> 00:30:16.581
David Boder: Yes?

00:30:16.581 --> 00:30:22.234
Ludwig Hamburger: Buchenwald was at one time also partly a camp of the greens, of professional criminals, but in part...

00:30:22.234 --> 00:30:24.013
David Boder: The greens you call the professional criminals.

00:30:24.013 --> 00:30:24.676
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes.

00:30:24.676 --> 00:30:25.822
David Boder: Yes.

00:30:25.822 --> 00:30:32.546
Ludwig Hamburger: In 1938 the socialists, the Reds, the political prisoners have taken the reigns.

00:30:32.546 --> 00:30:34.340
David Boder: Already the thirty-eight.

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:34.777
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes.

00:30:34.777 --> 00:30:36.194
David Boder: Nu?

00:30:36.194 --> 00:30:42.345
Ludwig Hamburger: Then the fight was on. In thirty-eight the political prisoners were in. Then the greens came again...

00:30:42.345 --> 00:30:43.008
David Boder: Yes?

00:30:43.008 --> 00:30:57.179
Ludwig Hamburger: ...so that the fight had...till forty-three, forty-four it was always very bad in Buchenwald. It was the same as in Auschwitz...[Noise of machinery in the background in the ORT training shop. Some-body must have entered the room. Also some loud voices from a distance.]

00:30:57.179 --> 00:30:58.415
David Boder: And so in Buchenwald?

00:30:58.415 --> 00:31:08.921
Ludwig Hamburger: Then in forty-four the Reds came to power. That means the political prisoners.

00:31:08.921 --> 00:31:09.916
David Boder: Hm.

00:31:09.916 --> 00:31:10.851
Ludwig Hamburger: The lager has become [?].

00:31:10.851 --> 00:31:11.424
David Boder: [Words not clear.]Yes.

00:31:11.424 --> 00:31:11.831
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes.

00:31:11.831 --> 00:31:13.278
David Boder: Hm.

00:31:13.278 --> 00:31:15.419
Ludwig Hamburger: Then there were no more distinctions between Jew...

00:31:15.419 --> 00:31:16.218
David Boder: Hm.

00:31:16.218 --> 00:31:18.434
Ludwig Hamburger: ...and Aryan. All of us were the same.

00:31:18.434 --> 00:31:18.977
David Boder: Nu?

00:31:18.977 --> 00:31:23.153
Ludwig Hamburger: We were all the same under the supervision [?] of the SS.

00:31:23.153 --> 00:31:24.887
David Boder: Nu?

00:31:24.887 --> 00:31:57.884
Ludwig Hamburger: And we had only one friend [enemy?]. The food was, of course, like in any concentration camp. [Pause.] Long appells...from four hours[and more] ...and so we have endured till the beginning of April. In the beginning of April we have received news that the offensive of the Allies was already very near.

00:31:57.884 --> 00:31:59.859
David Boder: How [by what means] was the news received?

00:31:59.859 --> 00:32:03.733
Ludwig Hamburger: We worked in war factories in the town, in Weimar...

00:32:03.733 --> 00:32:04.397
David Boder: Yes?

00:32:04.397 --> 00:32:12.583
Ludwig Hamburger: ...so that at work one observes.... We saw the expressions on the faces of the Germans. We said, ‘There is something new [something is happening].’

00:32:12.583 --> 00:32:16.307
David Boder: Nu.

00:32:16.307 --> 00:32:21.538
Ludwig Hamburger: [ Pause.] Nu. So it was.... The hope was again renewed.

00:32:21.538 --> 00:32:23.076
David Boder: Yes.

00:32:23.076 --> 00:32:51.798
Ludwig Hamburger: Maybe...maybe stil...maybe we are the remains, the lucky ones that will pull through. [Pause.] At once, in the morning, we don’t leave any more for work. All of us remain in the concentration camps. What’s up? Nobody knows [?]. All at once we hear.... We had radios...that is we had loudspeakers in rad-...in the lager.

00:32:51.798 --> 00:32:52.537
David Boder: Nu?

00:32:52.537 --> 00:32:56.261
Ludwig Hamburger: ‘All Jews to the appell square at once.’

00:32:56.261 --> 00:32:57.512
David Boder: Hm.

00:32:57.512 --> 00:32:59.924
Ludwig Hamburger: We all knew what for. Evacuation.

00:32:59.924 --> 00:33:01.703
David Boder: Yes?

00:33:01.703 --> 00:33:03.331
Ludwig Hamburger: And so the lager elder...

00:33:03.331 --> 00:33:04.176
David Boder: Louder [please].

00:33:04.176 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: But the lager elder...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:33:06.694
David Boder: Nu.

00:33:06.694 --> 00:33:16.749
Ludwig Hamburger: ...said, ‘Either everybody or nobody.’ And the Jews were mixed together with the Aryans.

00:33:16.749 --> 00:33:20.156
David Boder: Mixed together. Yes? Didn’t you carry markings?

00:33:20.156 --> 00:33:21.724
Ludwig Hamburger: The markings were torn off.

00:33:21.724 --> 00:33:22.659
David Boder: Yes?

00:33:22.659 --> 00:33:28.553
Ludwig Hamburger: And so it was not known [any more]. And nobody knows who was Jewish, who was Aryan. That was done by the ‘council’ [?] in Buchenwald.

00:33:28.553 --> 00:33:29.534
David Boder: Hm.

00:33:29.534 --> 00:33:49.991
Ludwig Hamburger: The SS men came down and they started simply to identify them, but not many have they found out. Then they started to take simply everybody, Aryans, Jews, everybody in a row. [Pause.] We already saw daily the fighters, the American fighter, over the lager.

00:33:49.991 --> 00:33:50.986
David Boder: The American what?

00:33:50.986 --> 00:33:51.891
Ludwig Hamburger: Fighters [he uses the term Jaeger meaning hunters, apparently fighter planes].

00:33:51.891 --> 00:33:52.600
David Boder: What is that?

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:53.278
Ludwig Hamburger: Well...

00:33:53.278 --> 00:33:54.183
David Boder: The flying ships [airplanes]?

00:33:54.183 --> 00:33:54.515
Ludwig Hamburger: The flying ships, yes.

00:33:54.515 --> 00:33:55.646
David Boder: Yes?

00:33:55.646 --> 00:33:58.254
Ludwig Hamburger: And hope was renewed.

00:33:58.254 --> 00:33:59.792
David Boder: Hm.

00:33:59.792 --> 00:34:01.134
Ludwig Hamburger: On the eleventh of April...

00:34:01.134 --> 00:34:04.194
David Boder: And so where did they take them, whom they gathered together?

00:34:04.194 --> 00:34:06.727
Ludwig Hamburger: They simply took them out and then evacuated.

00:34:06.727 --> 00:34:07.496
David Boder: Where?

00:34:07.496 --> 00:34:08.928
Ludwig Hamburger: Nobo-.... We didn’t know.

00:34:08.928 --> 00:34:10.556
David Boder: Hm. Nu?

00:34:10.556 --> 00:34:15.290
Ludwig Hamburger: The lager didn’t receive any more food on account of the evacuation, because nobody wanted to go.

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:18.682
David Boder: Nu.

00:34:18.682 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: [ Coughs.] But we told ourselves if already...I have already gone through one evacuation, I know exactly what it is.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:34:27.380
David Boder: Hm.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:35.883
Ludwig Hamburger: So I did not go [?] for the evacuation. Under no circumstances would I have gone for it. I told myself I’d rather here...

00:34:35.883 --> 00:34:36.064
David Boder: Nu?

00:34:36.064 --> 00:34:44.612
Ludwig Hamburger: ...rather die here than to endure another evacuation. The same thing that I have endured in Auschwitz I could never endure any more.

00:34:44.612 --> 00:34:45.803
David Boder: Nu?

00:34:45.803 --> 00:35:02.612
Ludwig Hamburger: Because the strength that I had then, alas, I had then no more in Buchenwald. I was already too tired. The eleventh of April, this is the day that nobody among us will forget. This is the day of our liberation! [Raises his voice.]

00:35:02.612 --> 00:35:04.994
David Boder: Nu?

00:35:04.994 --> 00:35:07.270
Ludwig Hamburger: At three forty-five...

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:08.386
David Boder: Day or night?

00:35:08.386 --> 00:35:11.235
Ludwig Hamburger: ...on the eleventh of April, daytime, in the afternoon...

00:35:11.235 --> 00:35:12.049
David Boder: Yes?

00:35:12.049 --> 00:35:17.145
Ludwig Hamburger: ...the first American armored tank cut the fence of Buchenwald.

00:35:17.145 --> 00:35:19.150
David Boder: Hm.

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:22.165
Ludwig Hamburger: The joy, it is impossible to describe.

00:35:22.165 --> 00:35:22.859
David Boder: Hm.

00:35:22.859 --> 00:35:26.221
Ludwig Hamburger: It is impossible to [de-]scribe. The soldiers...

00:35:26.221 --> 00:35:26.990
David Boder: Hm.

00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:35.025
Ludwig Hamburger: ...who went through the fighting...who have.... They couldn’t shed any tears...when they saw us.... When they saw us they wept like little children.

00:35:35.025 --> 00:35:36.412
David Boder: Which soldiers?

00:35:36.412 --> 00:36:22.708
Ludwig Hamburger: The American soldiers. They could never imagine that we, now, in this century, could live through such things. The people... I’ll never forget their faces. They were all covered with dust. Only their teeth and eyes were seen. And when they saw us, they cried. They took everybody of us.... They kissed us. They gave us everything. One took off his jacket. He saw someone of us was without a jacket and took it out [?]. [He becomes almost incoherent.] They could never believe that now, here in Germany, near Weimar[Footnote: Weimar is most often associated with the name Goethe. Buchenwald, according to reports, was the location of the famous Goethe’s Oak. [See the Bramson story].], one of the most cult-...cultural cities in Germany, something like this can be found. [Pause.] Yes!

00:36:22.708 --> 00:36:23.945
David Boder: Nu?

00:36:23.945 --> 00:36:52.377
Ludwig Hamburger: Then...came the others. [Pause.] They couldn’t believe that they were already free. I asked a woman.... Even today, when I am home [weeps] and I reminisce, then I say to myself one of the two is impossible: either I dream now or the past was a dream.

00:36:52.377 --> 00:36:58.437
David Boder: This concludes spool 72 reported by Mr. Hamburger. What is your first name?

00:36:58.437 --> 00:36:59.583
Ludwig Hamburger: Ludwig.

00:36:59.583 --> 00:37:13.865
David Boder: Ludwig. In Geneva at the shops of the ORT. An Illinois Institute of Technology Recording.

00:37:13.865 --> 00:37:49.337
David Boder: [ In English] This is spool 73. [Noise: test.] This is spool 73. [Noise of microphone test.] Geneva, August the 26th. The interviewee is Ludwig Hamburger who just finished spool 72. I’ll try to see if I can make him answer a few questions. [In German] And so, and so tell me, Mr. Hamburger, what did you do all day in Buchenwald?

00:37:49.337 --> 00:38:08.819
Ludwig Hamburger: In Buchenwald we got up in the morning at six o’clock, and the appell was held, as in any other concentration camp, and then after appell to work.

00:38:08.819 --> 00:38:10.703
David Boder: What did you work at?

00:38:10.703 --> 00:38:15.467
Ludwig Hamburger: In Buchenwald is known the stone quarry.

00:38:15.467 --> 00:38:17.126
David Boder: Yes?

00:38:17.126 --> 00:38:19.824
Ludwig Hamburger: We broke rocks, we carried rocks.

00:38:19.824 --> 00:38:22.056
David Boder: What was done with the rocks?

00:38:22.056 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: They were as.... They were used for road building...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:38:25.780
David Boder: Yes?

00:38:25.780 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: ...over all Germany.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:38:28.418
David Boder: Yes?

00:38:28.418 --> 00:38:30.921
Ludwig Hamburger: Then there were also the repair shops.

00:38:30.921 --> 00:38:33.710
David Boder: Yes. With what were the rocks broken? Did you have a hammer?

00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:34.087
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes.

00:38:34.087 --> 00:38:34.645
David Boder: Yes.

00:38:34.645 --> 00:38:36.349
Ludwig Hamburger: Tools they gave us.

00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:38.625
David Boder: Yes?

00:38:38.625 --> 00:38:43.058
Ludwig Hamburger: There were very near to Buchenwald the large repair shops.

00:38:43.058 --> 00:38:43.827
David Boder: Yes?

00:38:43.827 --> 00:38:50.023
Ludwig Hamburger: There were also parts for the V-1’s.

00:38:50.023 --> 00:38:52.933
David Boder: Yes?

00:38:52.933 --> 00:39:05.189
Ludwig Hamburger: Many, many prisoners worked there the supervision, under strict control of SS men, of masters, capos, foremen, and so forth.

00:39:05.189 --> 00:39:08.657
David Boder: Now then...

00:39:08.657 --> 00:39:18.562
Ludwig Hamburger: The work consisted mostly of transportation. That means, carrying of iron.

00:39:18.562 --> 00:39:21.954
David Boder: Transportation. Carrying of iron, and?

00:39:21.954 --> 00:39:31.587
Ludwig Hamburger: And communication between machines, that means transportation of one part of machinery to the other.

00:39:31.587 --> 00:39:33.426
David Boder: Yes?

00:39:33.426 --> 00:39:41.537
Ludwig Hamburger: The work was heavy, responsible, and under very strict control.

00:39:41.537 --> 00:39:43.391
David Boder: Why was it responsible?

00:39:43.391 --> 00:39:47.643
Ludwig Hamburger: Because it was...we manufactured there the parts for the V-1’s.

00:39:47.643 --> 00:39:51.698
David Boder: Aha. V-1’s.

00:39:51.698 --> 00:40:04.241
Ludwig Hamburger: And if only one screw...if one screw was missing, or it was not properly fit, and this possibly could have been done by a worker, a German worker...

00:40:04.241 --> 00:40:04.467
David Boder: Yes?

00:40:04.467 --> 00:40:10.618
Ludwig Hamburger: ...then the whole blame was transferred to the prisoners. [Test of microphone.]

00:40:10.618 --> 00:40:12.141
David Boder: Yes?

00:40:12.141 --> 00:40:19.302
Ludwig Hamburger: And looked upon as sabotage, and...death sentence.

00:40:19.302 --> 00:40:24.835
David Boder: What does that mean, death sentence? How come? Was one brought to court, or what?

00:40:24.835 --> 00:40:35.192
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes. The SS men made up their own court. He was simply brought to the lager, and...tortures... [he uses a makeshift Latinism].

00:40:35.192 --> 00:40:35.870
David Boder: What?

00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:36.865
Ludwig Hamburger: Tortures.

00:40:36.865 --> 00:40:38.102
David Boder: What’s that?

00:40:38.102 --> 00:40:40.680
Ludwig Hamburger: Tormented.

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:44.464
David Boder: Oh, oh. He was tortured. Tormented. Yes?

00:40:44.464 --> 00:40:51.987
Ludwig Hamburger: Beaten up. He was left hanging of...from...that is, tied from a tree by his hands.

00:40:51.987 --> 00:40:52.696
David Boder: Yes?

00:40:52.696 --> 00:40:54.671
Ludwig Hamburger: And left hanging for ten hours.

00:40:54.671 --> 00:40:55.772
David Boder: Did you see that?

00:40:55.772 --> 00:40:56.390
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes.

00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.963
David Boder: Nu?

00:40:56.963 --> 00:40:59.089
Ludwig Hamburger: I hung once for two hours myself.

00:40:59.089 --> 00:41:00.310
David Boder: How did you hang?

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:01.848
Ludwig Hamburger: In Auschwitz.

00:41:01.848 --> 00:41:03.521
David Boder: I mean how come?

00:41:03.521 --> 00:41:05.783
Ludwig Hamburger: They tied the hands behind the back...

00:41:05.783 --> 00:41:06.431
David Boder: Yes?

00:41:06.431 --> 00:41:10.894
Ludwig Hamburger: ...and quite slowly pulled up with the rope. Pulled up, the rope made a burn.

00:41:10.894 --> 00:41:12.537
David Boder: Yes?

00:41:12.537 --> 00:41:13.864
Ludwig Hamburger: And I hung two hours.

00:41:13.864 --> 00:41:16.140
David Boder: And so, how high were your hands?

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:23.889
Ludwig Hamburger: I mean, well, the main idea was that the feet had to be five centimeters from the ground.

00:41:23.889 --> 00:41:25.095
David Boder: Oh, five centimeters off the ground

00:41:25.095 --> 00:41:26.181
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes.

00:41:26.181 --> 00:41:26.859
David Boder: Nu?

00:41:26.859 --> 00:41:29.814
Ludwig Hamburger: When they say that the bones [joints] have stretched...

00:41:29.814 --> 00:41:30.266
David Boder: Yes?

00:41:30.266 --> 00:41:36.146
Ludwig Hamburger: ...then they always pulled one up. So that we could feel, one can say, the ground under us.

00:41:36.146 --> 00:41:36.523
David Boder: Yes?

00:41:36.523 --> 00:41:37.955
Ludwig Hamburger: And we could not stand on it.

00:41:37.955 --> 00:41:41.694
David Boder: Hm. Your feet could not touch the ground.

00:41:41.694 --> 00:41:44.302
Ludwig Hamburger: Five centimeters over the ground.

00:41:44.302 --> 00:41:45.719
David Boder: Yes?

00:41:45.719 --> 00:41:49.880
Ludwig Hamburger: And so with outstretched toes, I had the five centimeters under my toes.

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.071
David Boder: Yes?

00:41:51.071 --> 00:41:52.202
Ludwig Hamburger: From the ground.

00:41:52.202 --> 00:41:54.720
David Boder: And so you could not touch the ground?

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:55.700
Ludwig Hamburger: No, no, no!

00:41:55.700 --> 00:42:00.388
David Boder: No. Nu? For what was this done?

00:42:00.388 --> 00:42:18.263
Ludwig Hamburger: In Germany just for the smallest trifle. For not saying good morning in Auschwitz. Also in Buchenwald I went through this many times. I am passing an SS man. I take off the cap.

00:42:18.263 --> 00:42:19.484
David Boder: Yes?

00:42:19.484 --> 00:42:43.334
Ludwig Hamburger: And I stop. Then he calls me over and asks me, ‘Ah, are you my friend?’ I don’t give any answer. Then he beats me. The next time I say to myself, ‘So I won’t take off my cap.’ And I pass by him and I don’t take my cap off. He calls me again. ‘You don’t know one must take his cap off?’ So that I did not know myself what to do.

00:42:43.334 --> 00:42:43.967
David Boder: Nu?

00:42:43.967 --> 00:42:49.636
Ludwig Hamburger: And so it was with everything...every day.

00:42:49.636 --> 00:42:53.541
David Boder: You said you were hung by the hands for two hours?

00:42:53.541 --> 00:42:54.099
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes.

00:42:54.099 --> 00:42:57.159
David Boder: But, yes, where did you feel the pain? How was it?

00:42:57.159 --> 00:42:58.818
Ludwig Hamburger: And so...[he points].

00:42:58.818 --> 00:42:59.768
David Boder: In the shoulders?

00:42:59.768 --> 00:43:00.808
Ludwig Hamburger: In the shoulders.

00:43:00.808 --> 00:43:01.713
David Boder: Yes?

00:43:01.713 --> 00:43:04.532
Ludwig Hamburger: And here in the...connections.... What is it called?

00:43:04.532 --> 00:43:05.376
David Boder: In the elbow?

00:43:05.376 --> 00:43:06.552
Ludwig Hamburger: In the elbows.

00:43:06.552 --> 00:43:06.944
David Boder: Yes?

00:43:06.944 --> 00:43:08.331
Ludwig Hamburger: And in the hands here.

00:43:08.331 --> 00:43:08.633
David Boder: Yes.

00:43:08.633 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: And in the legs.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:43:12.064
David Boder: Now tell me...

00:43:12.064 --> 00:43:14.347
Ludwig Hamburger: In general the breath. I could not breathe.

00:43:14.347 --> 00:43:16.262
David Boder: You could not breathe. Yes?

00:43:16.262 --> 00:43:20.920
Ludwig Hamburger: Everything was twisted, and I.... The hands were pulled downwards...

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:21.433
David Boder: Yes?

00:43:21.433 --> 00:43:22.714
Ludwig Hamburger: ...not frontward. Thus.

00:43:22.714 --> 00:43:26.483
David Boder: How was that done? Why? For what was done?

00:43:26.483 --> 00:43:27.297
Ludwig Hamburger: And so...

00:43:27.297 --> 00:43:28.564
David Boder: In your case?

00:43:28.564 --> 00:43:34.338
Ludwig Hamburger: In my case, I wanted to say something to my friend during work...

00:43:34.338 --> 00:43:35.710
David Boder: Aha.

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:41.665
Ludwig Hamburger: ...and spoke to him, and a master complained about me, that I am not working. All I told him was, ‘Watch out.’

00:43:41.665 --> 00:43:42.238
David Boder: Yes.

00:43:42.238 --> 00:43:43.113
Ludwig Hamburger: ‘Watch out.”

00:43:43.113 --> 00:43:43.761
David Boder: Yes.

00:43:43.761 --> 00:43:48.917
Ludwig Hamburger: And just for that word only I was left hanging by my hands for two hours.

00:43:48.917 --> 00:43:51.811
David Boder: Were also others at the same time in these circumstances?

00:43:51.811 --> 00:43:58.837
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes. There were every day very many. It was a room arranged with hooks.

00:43:58.837 --> 00:43:59.304
David Boder: Yes?

00:43:59.304 --> 00:44:04.490
Ludwig Hamburger: There were about fifteen hooks. At that day the fifteen hooks were occupied.

00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:06.872
David Boder: Yes, And who did that?

00:44:06.872 --> 00:44:07.867
Ludwig Hamburger: The SS.

00:44:07.867 --> 00:44:09.978
David Boder: The SS, not the capos?

00:44:09.978 --> 00:44:31.521
Ludwig Hamburger: The capos, but under the supervision of the SS. The SS.men stood.... They had the greatest joy...had...when they knew that one is supposed to receive a beating, or...or done something to him. Then they all came and watched. They laughed. It was...was the most beautiful thing for them.

00:44:31.521 --> 00:44:35.667
David Boder: Hm. Nu? And so you worked in Buchenwald?

00:44:35.667 --> 00:44:36.496
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes.

00:44:36.496 --> 00:44:43.069
David Boder: Nu. Tell me how....Could you write letters?

00:44:43.069 --> 00:44:46.476
Ludwig Hamburger: In Buchenwald one is permitted to write letters, thirty words.

00:44:46.476 --> 00:44:47.773
David Boder: To whom did you write?

00:44:47.773 --> 00:44:49.145
Ludwig Hamburger: I did not write at all.

00:44:49.145 --> 00:44:49.401
David Boder: Why?

00:44:49.401 --> 00:44:57.180
Ludwig Hamburger: Because I knew that the letters were under strict control. When one writes one must write, ‘Things go well with me.’

00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:57.904
David Boder: Hm.

00:44:57.904 --> 00:44:59.185
Ludwig Hamburger: ‘I miss nothing.’

00:44:59.185 --> 00:44:59.547
David Boder: Hm.

00:44:59.547 --> 00:45:01.296
Ludwig Hamburger: ‘I do not need anything. I am satisfied.’

00:45:01.296 --> 00:45:01.974
David Boder: Yes?

00:45:01.974 --> 00:45:04.537
Ludwig Hamburger: Such letters I never wanted to write.

00:45:04.537 --> 00:45:06.768
David Boder: And to whom were they written?

00:45:06.768 --> 00:45:10.206
Ludwig Hamburger: Well, to the family, or to friends [?].

00:45:10.206 --> 00:45:12.513
David Boder: Did you receive any letters from your family?

00:45:12.513 --> 00:45:13.222
Ludwig Hamburger: No.

00:45:13.222 --> 00:45:17.669
David Boder: Tell me, what was your parents’ occupation in Sosnowice...in Katowice?

00:45:17.669 --> 00:45:18.664
Ludwig Hamburger: In Katowice

00:45:18.664 --> 00:45:19.177
David Boder: Yes.

00:45:19.177 --> 00:45:22.267
Ludwig Hamburger: My father had a factory.

00:45:22.267 --> 00:45:25.463
David Boder: Now Katowice was in olden times German, and then...

00:45:25.463 --> 00:45:25.795
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes.

00:45:25.795 --> 00:00:00.000
David Boder: ...it became Polish.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:45:26.669
Ludwig Hamburger: Became Polish.

00:45:26.669 --> 00:45:28.539
David Boder: What kind of factory did your father have?

00:45:28.539 --> 00:45:30.212
Ludwig Hamburger: Building hardware.

00:45:30.212 --> 00:45:31.418
David Boder: What is that?

00:45:31.418 --> 00:45:38.504
Ludwig Hamburger: Well, construction metal. That means metal parts for building construction.

00:45:38.504 --> 00:45:42.529
David Boder: Yes. And did you have brothers or sisters?

00:45:42.529 --> 00:45:43.283
Ludwig Hamburger: One sister.

00:45:43.283 --> 00:45:44.956
David Boder: And where is she?

00:45:44.956 --> 00:45:50.172
Ludwig Hamburger: She was brought to Auschwitz together with the parents, and since then I have no information.

00:45:50.172 --> 00:46:00.514
David Boder: You have had no information. Nu? Tell me, what are you doing now in Switzerland?

00:46:00.514 --> 00:46:03.198
Ludwig Hamburger: Then came a commission to Buchenwald...

00:46:03.198 --> 00:46:03.515
David Boder: Yes?

00:46:03.515 --> 00:46:05.219
Ludwig Hamburger: ...from the...from the Swiss Red Cross...

00:46:05.219 --> 00:46:06.561
David Boder: Yes?

00:46:06.561 --> 00:46:11.883
Ludwig Hamburger: ...and they took the youths to Switzerland to recuperate.

00:46:11.883 --> 00:46:12.893
David Boder: To recuperate. Yes?

00:46:12.893 --> 00:46:15.275
Ludwig Hamburger: We were approximately three hundred boys...

00:46:15.275 --> 00:46:16.707
David Boder: Boys, yes?

00:46:16.707 --> 00:46:22.948
Ludwig Hamburger: ...brought from Buchenwald to Switzerland to recuperate.

00:46:22.948 --> 00:46:26.416
David Boder: To recuperate. Yes? Nu?

00:46:26.416 --> 00:46:30.501
Ludwig Hamburger: And here in Switzerland we have recuperated. We were...

00:46:30.501 --> 00:46:32.461
David Boder: Where did you live? Where have you...

00:46:32.461 --> 00:46:34.753
Ludwig Hamburger: We were brought to Reinfelden.

00:46:34.753 --> 00:46:38.115
David Boder: Yes? And who provided for you?

00:46:38.115 --> 00:46:41.854
Ludwig Hamburger: The Swiss Red Cross. They sent nurses...

00:46:41.854 --> 00:46:42.563
David Boder: Yes?

00:46:42.563 --> 00:46:43.995
Ludwig Hamburger: ...to care for us.

00:46:43.995 --> 00:46:44.839
David Boder: Yes?

00:46:44.839 --> 00:46:48.910
Ludwig Hamburger: Then we were brought to different homes.

00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:49.980
David Boder: Yes?

00:46:49.980 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: And we were shown life from a completely different angle than we have know till now.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:46:57.428
David Boder: Hm.

00:46:57.428 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: They wanted to show us. They took pains to show us what life really looks like...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:47:07.604
David Boder: Yes?

00:47:07.604 --> 00:47:15.745
Ludwig Hamburger: ...to show us how one should behave in company, and the showed us /the ways of/ friendship and family [life].

00:47:15.745 --> 00:47:17.147
David Boder: Nu?

00:47:17.147 --> 00:47:19.559
Ludwig Hamburger: Then we arrived in Geneva.

00:47:19.559 --> 00:47:20.433
David Boder: Yes?

00:47:20.433 --> 00:47:21.127
Ludwig Hamburger: And so...

00:47:21.127 --> 00:47:22.469
David Boder: And so? Yes?

00:47:22.469 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: I came to Geneva...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:47:24.534
David Boder: Hm.

00:47:24.534 --> 00:47:27.821
Ludwig Hamburger: ...in order to attend the ORT schools.

00:47:27.821 --> 00:47:28.801
David Boder: Aha.

00:47:28.801 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: I knew one thing. Now, if after all the things I have endured, in spite of my being very young...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:47:38.766
David Boder: Hm.

00:47:38.766 --> 00:47:49.424
Ludwig Hamburger: ...I know though that every man must work in order to live. And we especially.

00:47:49.424 --> 00:47:51.083
David Boder: Whom do you mean by ‘we’?

00:47:51.083 --> 00:47:53.631
Ludwig Hamburger: We who have endured so much.

00:47:53.631 --> 00:47:54.701
David Boder: Yes?

00:47:54.701 --> 00:49:09.857
Ludwig Hamburger: We know that nothing....And we do not ever demand anything to be given us as a gift. We are young. We are strong. Strong because we endured everything. And we wanted to build our own existence. We know how to appreciate work. And we...we know very well that one must educate himself. We have to catch up with the lost time that we spent in concentration camp. We came out wild from the concentration camp, like animals. During the first days we simply did not know how to walk in the street. We were locked up behind an electrified fence, always under beating, always afraid of being murdered without cause [?]. Slowly we got used to the new atmosphere which we have entered. Then I told myself I must have knowledge. I have to learn a trade in order to better build my future life. I began to search. I have reported voluntarily. I have made an application, a petition...

00:49:09.857 --> 00:49:14.063
David Boder: Where to?

00:49:14.063 --> 00:49:19.852
Ludwig Hamburger: To ORT...

00:49:19.852 --> 00:49:21.254
David Boder: Yes?

00:49:21.254 --> 00:49:22.324
Ludwig Hamburger: ...to accept me.

00:49:22.324 --> 00:49:22.716
David Boder: Hm.

00:49:22.716 --> 00:49:26.741
Ludwig Hamburger: I was accepted.

00:49:26.741 --> 00:49:27.842
David Boder: What are you learning now?

00:49:27.842 --> 00:49:31.837
Ludwig Hamburger: Now I am learning, here in Gent [Geneva], ORT, to be a mechanic.

00:49:31.837 --> 00:49:33.058
David Boder: You are learning to be a mechanic?

00:49:33.058 --> 00:49:33.782
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes.

00:49:33.782 --> 00:49:36.390
David Boder: And how long will it take till you become a mechanic.

00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:39.164
Ludwig Hamburger: It takes...the course takes two and a half years.

00:49:39.164 --> 00:49:44.636
David Boder: Two and a half years. And where do you think to go then?

00:49:44.636 --> 00:49:46.053
Ludwig Hamburger: [ Pause.] I only have one desire.

00:49:46.053 --> 00:49:49.174
David Boder: Yes?

00:49:49.174 --> 00:00:00.000
Ludwig Hamburger: I should like to learn my trade.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:49:51.737
David Boder: Hm.

00:49:51.737 --> 00:50:06.737
Ludwig Hamburger: The first and most important thing is to have something in the hands. We know too well, a man who knows nothing, is nothing. [This is a play on words. With a different spelling of the verb, isst instead of ist, it means: One who is nothing, eats nothing.] We must....And all of us are learning a trade...

00:50:06.737 --> 00:50:08.003
David Boder: Yes?

00:50:08.003 --> 00:50:10.446
Ludwig Hamburger: ...so as to build our future existence.

00:50:10.446 --> 00:50:20.351
David Boder: Nu. Tell me, were there any poems or stories...songs in Buchenwald?

00:50:20.351 --> 00:50:21.421
Ludwig Hamburger: Yes.

00:50:21.421 --> 00:50:23.833
David Boder: Do you know any poems from Buchenwald?

00:50:23.833 --> 00:50:25.492
Ludwig Hamburger: No. I know a song.

00:50:25.492 --> 00:50:27.407
David Boder: Well, would you sing it a bit.

00:50:27.407 --> 00:50:29.261
Ludwig Hamburger: I...I am not much of a singer.

00:50:29.261 --> 00:50:36.128
David Boder: No, you do not have to be, so long as the words are heard clearly. Yes?

00:50:36.128 --> 00:52:08.456
Ludwig Hamburger: [sings] “When the day awakens / And the sun is laughing / The columns go forth / From the day’s toil / Through the grey of the morning. / And the woods are black / And the sky red. / And we carry in the sack a piece of bread, / But in our heart, in our heart the worry. / Oh, Buchenwald, I can never forget you, [Refrain.] / Because you are my fate. / Who leaves you, he only is able to comprehend / How wonderful freedom is. / Oh, Buchenwald, we do not cry and complain. / Whatever may be our future / We shall in spite of it say yes to life, / Because once the day shall come / When we shall be free!” [Repeat last four lines]

00:52:08.456 --> 00:52:12.315
David Boder: Now did the SS hear you sing it?

00:52:12.315 --> 00:52:13.478
Ludwig Hamburger: No.

00:52:13.478 --> 00:52:14.458
David Boder: When was it sung?

00:52:14.458 --> 00:52:16.373
Ludwig Hamburger: After the liberation.

00:52:16.373 --> 00:52:18.499
David Boder: Was it composed after the liberation?

00:52:18.499 --> 00:52:33.665
Ludwig Hamburger: No. It was a song of Buchenwald. We have....The SS men knew quite well that... But the words were changed after the liberation. For instance, the last word, ‘The day will come when we shall be free!’

00:52:33.665 --> 00:52:35.444
David Boder: And what was it before?

00:52:35.444 --> 00:52:41.354
Ludwig Hamburger: Before...it was....I do not remember too well.

00:52:41.354 --> 00:52:46.344
David Boder: Hm. Can you remember any Jewish songs from Auschwitz or anywhere else?

00:52:46.344 --> 00:52:47.384
Ludwig Hamburger: There are quite a few.

00:52:47.384 --> 00:52:58.585
David Boder: Yes. Try one. I want to have....Can you remember ‘It Burns’?

00:52:58.585 --> 00:53:00.304
Ludwig Hamburger: One moment. [He thinks.]

00:53:00.304 --> 00:53:04.812
David Boder: Yes. [Pause.]

00:53:04.812 --> 00:53:08.717
Ludwig Hamburger: I know a song from deportation.

00:53:08.717 --> 00:53:09.456
David Boder: Yes?

00:53:09.456 --> 00:53:10.918
Ludwig Hamburger: When we were sent on the transport.

00:53:10.918 --> 00:53:12.004
David Boder: Yes?

00:53:12.004 --> 00:53:18.140
Ludwig Hamburger: When we returned home, alone, without parents, so we sang this song.

00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:21.092
David Boder: All right.

00:53:21.092 --> 00:55:37.300
Ludwig Hamburger: [sings] “We have wandered throughout the night, / Not knowing where we are going. / What will be our destination? / Because, without a home and without an end, / We have wandered throughout the night. / Through forests [?] we were driven / Surrounded by [words not clear]. / With clubs we were beaten / Not knowing what for. / The children cry out, ‘Mother! I am hungry!’ / And the mothers had no bread for them. / oi, oi had, oi oi had! / Because, without a home and without a roof, / We have wandered throughout the night, / Not knowing where we are going. / What will be our destination? / Because, without a home and without a roof, / We wandered throughout the night!”

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:48.558
David Boder: [In English] This concludes the interview with Mr. Ludwig Hamburger. At Geneva, August the 26th, 1946, at the ORT School. An Illinois Institute of Technology wire recording.
