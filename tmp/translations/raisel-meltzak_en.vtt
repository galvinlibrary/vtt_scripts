00:00:04.161 --> 00:00:09.770
David Boder: [In Yiddish] Talk in here. And so, Rose, tell me again, what is your name and how old are you?

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.014
Raisel Meltzak: [Words not clear]...speak Polish?

00:00:12.014 --> 00:00:17.282
David Boder: No, no, no. I have asked you before. Yiddish. You must speak Yiddish. Nu?

00:00:17.282 --> 00:00:22.934
Raisel Meltzak: Rose Meltzak. On the 30th...

00:00:22.934 --> 00:00:24.161
David Boder: How old are you?

00:00:24.161 --> 00:00:31.137
Raisel Meltzak: Eh...eh.../pause/

00:00:31.137 --> 00:00:33.173
David Boder: In short, how old are you?

00:00:33.173 --> 00:00:33.973
Raisel Meltzak: Thirteen.

00:00:33.973 --> 00:00:34.871
David Boder: You are thirteen years old.

00:00:34.871 --> 00:00:35.170
Raisel Meltzak: Yes.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.296
David Boder: [Words not clear].

00:00:37.296 --> 00:00:39.092
Raisel Meltzak: In January.

00:00:39.092 --> 00:00:43.673
David Boder: Wait a moment. Where were you when the war broke out?

00:00:43.673 --> 00:00:45.110
Raisel Meltzak: In the forest.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.848
David Boder: When the war broke out?

00:00:46.848 --> 00:00:50.082
Raisel Meltzak: At home still. In Busk. With the mother and with the father.

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:51.038
David Boder: In which town?

00:00:51.038 --> 00:00:52.226
Raisel Meltzak: In Busk.

00:00:52.226 --> 00:00:53.125
David Boder: In Busk?

00:00:53.125 --> 00:00:53.933
Raisel Meltzak: Yes.

00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:56.658
David Boder: And how old were you then?

00:00:56.658 --> 00:00:58.125
Raisel Meltzak: I do not remember.

00:00:58.125 --> 00:00:58.815
David Boder: You do not remember.

00:00:58.815 --> 00:00:59.292
Raisel Meltzak: No.

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:01.091
David Boder: You were a little girl.

00:01:01.091 --> 00:01:01.658
Raisel Meltzak: Yes.

00:01:01.658 --> 00:01:03.783
David Boder: Were you seven, eight years old?

00:01:03.783 --> 00:01:05.163
Raisel Meltzak: I do not remember.

00:01:05.163 --> 00:01:05.702
David Boder: You do not remember.

00:01:05.702 --> 00:01:06.061
Raisel Meltzak: [Giggles.]

00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:12.197
David Boder: And so. Nu, and when the war broke out, what happened then?

00:01:12.197 --> 00:01:13.606
Raisel Meltzak: To us?

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:15.073
David Boder: To you. To your family.

00:01:15.073 --> 00:01:20.891
Raisel Meltzak: Aha. [When] the Germans were there my father worked in the Judenrat [Jewish Community Council].

00:01:20.891 --> 00:01:21.810
David Boder: In Judenrat?

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.448
Raisel Meltzak: Yes.

00:01:22.448 --> 00:01:22.927
David Boder: Nu.

00:01:22.927 --> 00:01:31.819
Raisel Meltzak: He was, well, no rich [?]. He just worked. When the Germans were with us...

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:32.207
David Boder: Nu?

00:01:32.207 --> 00:01:39.363
Raisel Meltzak: . . . my father, earlier yet, excav-...excav-...how does one say it?—made such a hole [cave]...

00:01:39.363 --> 00:01:39.632
David Boder: Yes.

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:45.203
Raisel Meltzak: . . . where I, my mother, my father, and my little brother three years old...

00:01:45.203 --> 00:01:45.620
David Boder: Yes?

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:53.009
Raisel Meltzak: . . . and we hid there. We sat there not a [full] month.

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:53.520
David Boder: Yes.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.686
Raisel Meltzak: Hid. Hidden. Around two weeks.

00:01:54.686 --> 00:01:57.470
David Boder: What was the name of the town?...What was the name of the town?

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.219
Raisel Meltzak: Busk.

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.848
David Boder: Busk?

00:01:58.848 --> 00:01:59.626
Raisel Meltzak: Yes.

00:01:59.626 --> 00:02:02.981
David Boder: Was it near Warsaw? What city was it near?

00:02:02.981 --> 00:02:06.153
Raisel Meltzak: It was near Zlochev, Ternopol.

00:02:06.153 --> 00:02:07.293
David Boder: Near Ternopol.

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:08.339
Raisel Meltzak: Yes.

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:12.921
David Boder: All right, now we know. Nu, when did the father make...the father made a hole in which to hide?

00:02:12.921 --> 00:02:13.608
Raisel Meltzak: I do not remember any more?

00:02:13.608 --> 00:02:14.389
David Boder: You do not remember.

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:14.668
Raisel Meltzak: No.

00:02:14.668 --> 00:02:15.833
David Boder: Nu, did you hide...

00:02:15.833 --> 00:02:16.793
Raisel Meltzak: I tell only what I know.

00:02:16.793 --> 00:02:20.088
David Boder: Yes. Good. You hid in a hole.

00:02:20.088 --> 00:02:20.356
Raisel Meltzak: Yes.

00:02:20.356 --> 00:02:22.181
David Boder: Why did you have to hide?

00:02:22.181 --> 00:02:25.120
Raisel Meltzak: Because the Germans wanted to kill us.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.600
David Boder: Aha. Nu, what happened then?

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.246
Raisel Meltzak: There we...we lay. It was a—Can I tell where the hole was?

00:02:34.246 --> 00:02:35.386
David Boder: Yes, naturally.

00:02:35.386 --> 00:02:42.015
Raisel Meltzak: There it was...It was such a hole, there where horses stood.

00:02:42.015 --> 00:02:42.288
David Boder: Yes?

00:02:42.288 --> 00:02:43.540
Raisel Meltzak: Such a stable.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.021
David Boder: Yes?

00:02:44.021 --> 00:02:47.288
Raisel Meltzak: And under the stable we had that hole...

00:02:47.288 --> 00:02:48.410
David Boder: Yes.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.284
Raisel Meltzak: . . . where we sat. There on top was an attic.

00:02:51.284 --> 00:02:52.035
David Boder: Hm.

00:02:52.035 --> 00:03:08.165
Raisel Meltzak: And in the attic the Germans were walking. My brother—he was not even three years old then—began to cry. My mother gave him to...to drink. He refused. He cried so we thought that the Germans would kill us. But they did not hear [him]. We had enough money. My father was a horse trader.

00:03:08.165 --> 00:03:08.706
David Boder: Aha.

00:03:08.706 --> 00:03:24.782
Raisel Meltzak: We...we were not poor. A gentile woman brought us food. Not much, because we had been robbed, too [possibly she means cheated], but...

00:03:24.782 --> 00:03:25.509
David Boder: You had been robbed?

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.989
Raisel Meltzak: Yes, yes.

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:26.856
David Boder: What was taken from you?

00:03:26.856 --> 00:03:30.272
Raisel Meltzak: Things were taken from us, gold, such things.

00:03:30.272 --> 00:03:31.138
David Boder: Nu?

00:03:31.138 --> 00:03:32.814
Raisel Meltzak: And afterwards my father...

00:03:32.814 --> 00:03:33.892
David Boder: Who took it?

00:03:33.892 --> 00:03:37.168
Raisel Meltzak: Gentiles. The Ukrainians. I lived in the Ukraine.

00:03:37.168 --> 00:03:37.828
David Boder: Yes.

00:03:37.828 --> 00:03:52.138
Raisel Meltzak: There the gentiles robbed us, at night. Any my father paid the gentiles to bring us food. And she...she brought us a little soup, such a cold one.

00:03:52.138 --> 00:03:52.743
David Boder: Hm.

00:03:52.743 --> 00:04:13.440
Raisel Meltzak: It was not good. Well, it is better than nothing. Then we...the gentile woman said that the Germans were coming with dogs, and she must...The Germans had such dogs which only had to sniff to know where we are, where there is a Jew. And we ran away in the morning. In the morning, it was such...

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.512
David Boder: Who ran away? You ran away?

00:04:14.512 --> 00:04:16.518
Raisel Meltzak: Yes. All of us.

00:04:16.518 --> 00:04:16.998
David Boder: Yes.

00:04:16.998 --> 00:04:18.136
Raisel Meltzak: Yes. I, the mother, the father, [in a barely audible whisper] the little brother.

00:04:18.136 --> 00:04:19.152
David Boder: Hm.

00:04:19.152 --> 00:04:29.813
Raisel Meltzak: And the gentile woman...We were in a grove. We got so scared. There were many Jews lying unbur-...not yet buried, but they just lay about.

00:04:29.813 --> 00:04:30.610
David Boder: Dead people?

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.310
Raisel Meltzak: Yes, dead people.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.238
David Boder: Did you yourself see that?

00:04:32.238 --> 00:04:32.238
Raisel Meltzak: Yes, I saw that.

00:04:32.238 --> 00:04:34.814
David Boder: Go on.

00:04:34.814 --> 00:04:56.431
Raisel Meltzak: And we got away. It was so muddy it came up to...it was very...it was going on winter. It was going on winter. And...and we still had enough money, but the Ukrainians looted us. They took everything away from us. We remained in just one...one shirt.

00:04:56.431 --> 00:04:57.299
David Boder: What do you mean, ‘in one shirt’?

00:04:57.299 --> 00:05:02.510
Raisel Meltzak: In one shirt. We only had that what we had on us. [That] they did not take away but that which we carried.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:09.801
David Boder: But you wore more than a shirt. You wore a dress, a coat.

00:05:09.801 --> 00:05:12.102
Raisel Meltzak: Yes. A coat they took off, too.

00:05:12.102 --> 00:05:14.315
David Boder: The coat.

00:05:14.315 --> 00:05:34.740
Raisel Meltzak: Yes. We had left only one dress, two dresses, just what we wore. This was not taken away. But a coat they took off. And we went on. Afterwards we sat in the forest. Eh...and they took everything away from us, the—what is it in Yiddish?—the pastuchy [Polish for shepards].

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.117
David Boder: Yes. Shepards.

00:05:36.117 --> 00:05:36.448
Raisel Meltzak: Yes.

00:05:36.448 --> 00:05:36.896
David Boder: Go on.

00:05:36.896 --> 00:05:49.352
Raisel Meltzak: They took everything away from us. And...all right. I was...It was raining. We were all sitting. We made a shack out of sticks and out of hay and other such things.

00:05:49.352 --> 00:05:49.800
David Boder: Yes.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:57.745
Raisel Meltzak: And we were sitting there. Afterwards two other Jews arrived, a girl [a young woman?] and a boy [a young man?] from Busk, from our home town.

00:05:57.745 --> 00:05:58.882
David Boder: Hm.

00:05:58.882 --> 00:06:03.284
Raisel Meltzak: And they said...They dragged away my father, and he went. [They possibly belonged to the Jewish police.]

00:06:03.284 --> 00:06:05.230
David Boder: Wasn’t your father with you?

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:14.700
Raisel Meltzak: Yes, he was with us, but then they came, and, the girl and the boy, and dragged him away. He did not want to go, but they dragged him away.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.221
David Boder: How could the girl and the boy drag him away?

00:06:18.221 --> 00:06:25.768
Raisel Meltzak: They began...they took him aside and persuaded my father...why should he remain here?...[apparently imitating the conversation] that so he will be killed, and so he will be killed...[The so and so seem not to mean here either way, but an ennumeration of possibilities].

00:06:25.768 --> 00:06:25.292
David Boder: Oh.

00:06:25.292 --> 00:06:26.206
Raisel Meltzak: But...

00:06:26.206 --> 00:06:27.410
David Boder: Oh, they persuaded him to go.

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.283
Raisel Meltzak: Yes, yes, that he should go to a lager.

00:06:30.283 --> 00:06:31.362
David Boder: And who remained?

00:06:31.362 --> 00:06:32.998
Raisel Meltzak: I with the mother and [barely audible whisper] the little brother.

00:06:32.998 --> 00:06:33.879
David Boder: In the forest.

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:38.518
Raisel Meltzak: Yes, we remained in the forest. Afterwards we—shall I tell...

00:06:38.518 --> 00:06:38.850
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:39.386
Raisel Meltzak: . . . everything about the whole life?

00:06:39.386 --> 00:06:40.923
David Boder: Yes, yes.

00:06:40.923 --> 00:06:55.200
Raisel Meltzak: Afterwards we...eh...we remained alone. The father said, ‘Shh’...My mother’s name was was Rachel...’Rachel, if you want to come, you and Raisel’...My Jewish name is Raisel.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.672
David Boder: Yes.

00:06:55.672 --> 00:07:09.320
Raisel Meltzak: ‘If you [singular] want to go’...if you [plural] want to go with me, you must take the little brother and set him under a tree, or else you must throw him into...whichever...whichever you want, as long as you do not take him along’ [Little children, liable to cry unexpectedly, were one of the paramount handicaps in flight. —D.P.B.]

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:09.919
David Boder: The baby?

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:14.531
Raisel Meltzak: Yes, yes. That’s what he told me. It is all true. [Words not clear] very, very...

00:07:14.531 --> 00:07:17.473
David Boder: Well, yes. I understood. Why did he want...

00:07:17.473 --> 00:07:20.647
Raisel Meltzak: I do not know. I was still little. I did not understand at all.

00:07:20.647 --> 00:07:25.318
David Boder: Wait a moment. [Adjusting equipment.] And so, what happened? Go on.

00:07:25.318 --> 00:07:27.922
Raisel Meltzak: Eh...eh...Go on, yes?

00:07:27.922 --> 00:07:28.402
Raisel Meltzak: yes

00:07:28.402 --> 00:08:12.473
Raisel Meltzak: And afterwards my brother...All right. My mother said, ‘No! I will not leave the brother behind. And what will...The children...Whatever will happen to me will happen to the children. Whatever will happen to the children will happen to me.’ And the father...the father said, ‘Yes. If you want it so, remain. Remain. I am going.’ And my father was eating a piece of bread, and he leaned over. He started so...he threw away the bread he was eating. He could not eat...eat any more, and started to cry, just like a little child. Ah, he went away. And he went away. He did not want to remain with us. Afterwards we went...The Ukranians, the police, caught us and started to beat him...

00:08:12.473 --> 00:08:12.952
David Boder: Whom?

00:08:12.952 --> 00:08:32.524
Raisel Meltzak: Us. Me and the mother. They began to beat and kick the mother. She did not...she cried so. She did not...she did not know what was happening to her. She fell down, my mother. They began to kick and beat me. I was thr-...thrown into a...into such a...such a ditch [word in Polish dialect].

00:08:32.524 --> 00:08:33.782
David Boder: Into what? Into a ditch?

00:08:33.782 --> 00:08:36.147
Raisel Meltzak: I was thrown into a ditch [word in Polish].

00:08:36.147 --> 00:08:37.015
David Boder: Into a what?

00:08:37.015 --> 00:08:38.250
Raisel Meltzak: Into a ditch.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:39.143
David Boder: What does it mean?

00:08:39.143 --> 00:08:42.015
Raisel Meltzak: Such a—how is it in Yiddish?

00:08:42.015 --> 00:08:43.512
David Boder: Say it in Polish.

00:08:43.512 --> 00:08:47.943
Raisel Meltzak: [In Polish] Into...into such a hole.

00:08:47.943 --> 00:08:49.081
David Boder: Yes. Go on.

00:08:49.081 --> 00:09:41.355
Raisel Meltzak: And there...[in Yiddish] and there I was thrown in. They began to beat me with a horse whip. Afterwards my mother got up and pulled me out. The brother, she left him standing on the street, and me she...I got out. And then I cried so. The mother asked me why. I was still a small child, so I did not know. ‘Why is he doing this to me? Why? Did I deserve it, or what?’ I surely did not deserve it. I did not know. And the brother cried so. And afterwards we...All right. We ran away. We left everything and ran away. [As if to herself] And after that, what happened? Aha. And the father went away. The father said that, and he left. It was all the same already to him. After that, what else? [A very friendly, confident giggle.] I have already forgotten...

00:09:41.355 --> 00:09:41.894
David Boder: Of course.

00:09:41.894 --> 00:09:51.726
Raisel Meltzak: . . . quite a bit. Such a long time. Aha. After that we went away. We went to Antolowka. Antolowka.

00:09:51.726 --> 00:09:52.538
David Boder: What is that?

00:09:52.538 --> 00:09:54.662
Raisel Meltzak: There were such...Germans...

00:09:54.662 --> 00:09:56.278
David Boder: Yes.

00:09:56.278 --> 00:09:57.012
Raisel Meltzak: . . . such folk-...folk-Germans.

00:09:57.012 --> 00:09:57.668
David Boder: A small town.

00:09:57.668 --> 00:09:59.668
Raisel Meltzak: Yes. Folk-...folk-Germans...

00:09:59.668 --> 00:10:00.527
David Boder: Hm.

00:10:00.527 --> 00:10:16.429
Raisel Meltzak: . . . were there. They spoke German. I was there. They were very kind, very kind. They gave us food. They brought us food to the forest. I was [there] with the mother. Afterwards one...I have forgotten already. What is it in Polish? Do you understand Polish?

00:10:16.429 --> 00:10:17.351
David Boder: What is it?

00:10:17.351 --> 00:10:20.882
Raisel Meltzak: [In Polish] A policeman.

00:10:20.882 --> 00:10:21.803
David Boder: A policeman. Nu?

00:10:21.803 --> 00:10:54.865
Raisel Meltzak: [In Yiddish] The police caught us there in the forest. We were asked where we are from and what we are doing here and what business we have there. So we said, ‘We are Jews.’ We answered simply, ‘We are Jews, and we have nobody.’ The mother talked to them [words not clear]. I was sitting like a fool. I did not know what to say. And he said, ‘Come.’ Is it like this? So we went. The mother pleaded so, she cried, to let us go. We gave him something, so he let us go.

00:10:54.865 --> 00:10:56.036
David Boder: You gave him something?

00:10:56.036 --> 00:11:04.426
Raisel Meltzak: Yes, the mother gave him something, so he let us go. After that we went to Huta...Huta...[Khust?] Olejska.

00:11:04.426 --> 00:11:05.130
David Boder: Hm.

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.599
Raisel Meltzak: It is a Polish [in Polish] village—how does one say it?

00:11:08.599 --> 00:11:09.584
David Boder: A Polish village?

00:11:09.584 --> 00:11:18.833
Raisel Meltzak: A Polish village, yes. We were there. The gentiles were also very kind. We were there. We slept in barns.

00:11:18.833 --> 00:11:19.521
David Boder: Yes.

00:11:19.521 --> 00:11:35.954
Raisel Meltzak: We slept here a day, here a day, here a night. Thus we slept. My mother...I helped a little. The mother helped a little. We worked in the garden. We did all that...I had a—[In Polish] how does one say cow?

00:11:35.954 --> 00:11:37.672
David Boder: A cow?

00:11:37.672 --> 00:11:38.672
Raisel Meltzak: Yes, a cow.

00:11:38.672 --> 00:11:39.172
David Boder: Nu?

00:11:39.172 --> 00:11:46.031
Raisel Meltzak: We had...I tended [the cow] all day until night. Afterwards we left for Huta Olejska.

00:11:46.031 --> 00:11:47.968
David Boder: And the little brother was with you.

00:11:47.968 --> 00:11:52.296
Raisel Meltzak: Yes. After that, when we were in Huta Olejska...

00:11:52.296 --> 00:11:53.733
David Boder: Yes?

00:11:53.733 --> 00:12:04.467
Raisel Meltzak: . . . we went back there [where] we had been, with the Germans. I have already forgotten what the name of it is. There my brother died.

00:12:04.467 --> 00:12:05.935
David Boder: What did he die from?

00:12:05.935 --> 00:12:09.560
Raisel Meltzak: Yes, yes, he died. My brother had such a stomach...

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.341
David Boder: Oh.

00:12:10.341 --> 00:12:11.857
Raisel Meltzak: . . . such a large [stomach]—I do not know how it is [said] in Yiddish.

00:12:11.857 --> 00:12:13.295
David Boder: All right. Nu?

00:12:13.295 --> 00:12:29.093
Raisel Meltzak: And he died. We...my mother...He told my mother that his stomach hurts him, everything hurts him, and he cannot walk. And my mother set him down, and I with the mother went for bottles. My mother went to pick...There were bottles there with which I could go to the gentiles...

00:12:29.093 --> 00:12:29.781
David Boder: Hm.

00:12:29.781 --> 00:12:31.000
Raisel Meltzak: . . . and bring water...

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:31.625
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:31.625 --> 00:12:32.906
Raisel Meltzak: . . . or a little milk.

00:12:32.906 --> 00:12:33.594
David Boder: Yes. Nu?

00:12:33.594 --> 00:12:46.094
Raisel Meltzak: And...and...and my brother had already died when we came from...and my mother had gone there. I said, ‘You will go and pick’...from there I used to bring a little milk...

00:12:46.094 --> 00:12:47.313
David Boder: Yes.

00:12:47.313 --> 00:13:08.815
Raisel Meltzak: . . . or water. There I would leave the bottles. I always used to say, ‘I am...I feel...I do not need any more.’ I said this to the mother, because we were not supposed to be here in the forest, because the gentiles had said that we should not come, that today the police are around. And we did not go. And my mother took the bottles and went to the village[?]. And when I came [returned] the brother was already dead.

00:13:08.815 --> 00:13:09.893
David Boder: Nu?

00:13:09.893 --> 00:13:20.721
Raisel Meltzak: The brother was already dead. And my mother cried so much. In the forest there are many—how does one say it?—[in Polish] trees?

00:13:20.721 --> 00:13:21.846
David Boder: Trees.

00:13:21.846 --> 00:13:27.017
Raisel Meltzak: Trees. So she began to do it so, with her head [she apparently demonstrates]. She had such bumps.

00:13:27.017 --> 00:13:27.919
David Boder: She beat herself...

00:13:27.919 --> 00:13:28.325
Raisel Meltzak: Yes.

00:13:28.325 --> 00:13:29.044
David Boder: . . . against the trees?

00:13:29.044 --> 00:13:37.418
Raisel Meltzak: Yes. And she cried so very much. She screamed. She could not bear it. After my brother died we...we buried him.

00:13:37.418 --> 00:13:39.101
David Boder: Who buried him?

00:13:39.101 --> 00:13:39.944
Raisel Meltzak: I with the mother.

00:13:39.944 --> 00:13:41.413
David Boder: You with the mother?

00:13:41.413 --> 00:13:41.960
Raisel Meltzak: Yes, I with the mother.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:42.491
David Boder: In the forest?

00:13:42.491 --> 00:14:12.528
Raisel Meltzak: Yes, in the forest. Nothing, just dug such a tiny grave. He was only three years old. He was very small. And afterwards I remained with the mother. The mother cried very much. [short break in the wire]...very much. My mother was badly emaciated [?]. My mother did not get better, because my mother cried very much. She was so thin as this, as a stick. And afterwards I went with my mother another month, [or] two. I was with the mother another two months. And my mother died.

00:14:12.528 --> 00:14:13.247
David Boder: Where?

00:14:13.247 --> 00:14:13.747
Raisel Meltzak: My mother died.

00:14:13.747 --> 00:14:14.247
David Boder: In the forest?

00:14:14.247 --> 00:14:19.779
Raisel Meltzak: Yes, in the forest. Everything in the forest, because I was in the forest three years [words not clear].

00:14:19.779 --> 00:14:20.639
David Boder: Aha.

00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:21.967
Raisel Meltzak: Two and a half [years], not three.

00:14:21.967 --> 00:14:25.912
David Boder: [In whispers] You must go?

00:14:25.912 --> 00:14:26.490
Raisel Meltzak: Yes.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.724
David Boder: We shall talk again later, yes?

00:14:28.724 --> 00:14:27.944
Raisel Meltzak: Yes.
