David Boder: Paris, August the 23rd, 1946. The interviewee is Mr. Karl Josephy, 37 years old, born in Austria and lived in Paris since 1938.

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:28.456
David Boder: So, tell me once again, Mr. Josephy, what is your first name, and, where were you born, and, ah, so on ...

00:00:28.456 --> 00:00:37.129
Karl Josephy: Yes, my name is Karl Josephy, I was born in Vienna on June 6, 1909.

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.789
David Boder: And, ah, what was your father’s occupation?

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.626
Karl Josephy: My father was first an accountant ...

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:44.134
David Boder: Yes ...

00:00:44.134 --> 00:00:48.156
Karl Josephy: ... later director of a large bank ...

00:00:48.156 --> 00:00:48.640
David Boder: Yes ...

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.781
Karl Josephy: ... and later retired for age reasons.

00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:56.866
David Boder: Yes, ah, and how many children were you in the family?

00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.221
Karl Josephy: One child only.

00:00:58.221 --> 00:01:00.150
David Boder: You were the only son in a [sic] family.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.574
Karl Josephy: Yes.

00:01:00.574 --> 00:01:02.806
David Boder: What education did you have?

00:01:02.806 --> 00:01:06.399
Karl Josephy: I have an education —- ah, the middle school ...

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.968
David Boder: Yes ...

00:01:06.968 --> 00:01:08.141
Karl Josephy: —- ... the university.

00:01:08.141 --> 00:01:09.805
David Boder: What did you study at the university?

00:01:09.805 --> 00:01:11.553
Karl Josephy: I studied law.

00:01:11.553 --> 00:01:12.999
David Boder: Did you finish?

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:16.320
Karl Josephy: I finished except for one single exam.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.151
David Boder: Aha. Now, ah, what was your occupation in Austria?

00:01:22.151 --> 00:01:27.740
Karl Josephy: I, ah, was occupied with my studies in Austria at first...

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.550
David Boder: Yes ...

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:36.353
Karl Josephy: ... furthermore, I was [working] in an industry, in the paper branch – in the paper industry.

00:01:36.353 --> 00:01:40.551
David Boder: Why did you, ah, relocate to France?

00:01:40.551 --> 00:01:54.849
Karl Josephy: I relocated to France because through the revolution, the Nazi revolution in Austria, I was threatened in my profession, in my further intellectual progress as well as politically.

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:56.059
David Boder: Aha.

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:57.541
Karl Josephy: As a Jew.

00:01:57.541 --> 00:01:58.593
David Boder: As a Jew?

00:01:58.593 --> 00:02:01.612
Karl Josephy: Yes. [tape break]

00:02:01.612 --> 00:02:22.201
David Boder: Now, Mr. Josephy, if someone asked you, or if you would write a book, what would you want to tell us as the main points of your experiences, from (19)38 until the liberation?

00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:32.084
Karl Josephy: As main points, I would without doubt tell you of my dangers and my suffering that I endured .from the moment of my arrest ...

00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:33.384
David Boder: Yes ...

00:02:33.384 --> 00:02:38.011
Karl Josephy: ... which at the same time affected my wife.

00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:51.251
David Boder: So do you want to begin then? Do you want to begin how things were in Paris, and how the whole misfortune, ah —- how you were, ah, gradually pulled out of your quiet life?

00:02:51.251 --> 00:02:51.699
Karl Josephy: I was ...

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:52.963
David Boder: Tell the whole story ...

00:02:52.963 --> 00:03:07.963
Karl Josephy: I was drafted [Josephy uses the term “einrücken” which also implies that he volunteered for the Foreign Legion] as a volunteer for France and served my military service in Africa.

00:03:07.963 --> 00:03:09.596
David Boder: What was your rank?

00:03:09.596 --> 00:03:11.562
Karl Josephy: I was a common soldier [enlisted private].

00:03:11.562 --> 00:03:12.947
David Boder: Yes ...

00:03:12.947 --> 00:03:19.903
Karl Josephy: I did my best in the Foreign Legion, was also volunteer for the service at the front ...

00:03:19.903 --> 00:03:20.834
David Boder: Yes ...

00:03:20.834 --> 00:03:30.724
Karl Josephy: ... but the events around the precipitous armistice that France was forced to enter into ...

00:03:30.724 --> 00:03:31.020
David Boder: Yes ...

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.615
Karl Josephy: .... brought with it that I could not go to the front, and was demobilized.

00:03:36.615 --> 00:03:39.760
David Boder: Where were you during your demobilization?

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:47.139
Karl Josephy: The story of my demobilization is extremely tragic because...

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:47.532
David Boder: Yes ...

00:03:47.532 --> 00:04:12.049
Karl Josephy: ... because I was not demobilized like any other French soldier or every foreigner who had previously lived in France, but I was asked to provide impeccable papers of residence and 10,000 Francs as bond to be allowed back into France, to the metropolis. [ Josephy uses the term “Metropole” for the European French mainland] Because I had neither the paper of which I only possessed a copy —

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:13.253
David Boder: ... that was in Africa?

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:14.215
Karl Josephy: That was in Africa.

00:04:14.215 --> 00:04:14.572
David Boder: Yes ...

00:04:14.572 --> 00:04:34.949
Karl Josephy: ... because I neither had the papers – had them on me – nor the required 10,000 Francs, I was essentially imprisoned in Guarta [?, location not verified, possibly Ghardaia in present Algeria?] at the rim of the desert. I was forced to hard labor, the payment was null and the treatment very bad.

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:36.794
David Boder: Who did that?

00:04:36.794 --> 00:04:46.284
Karl Josephy: That was apparently done by orders of the Moroccan government that received their orders from the French metropolis [Josephy uses the term “Metropole” again]...

00:04:46.284 --> 00:04:47.155
David Boder: From Vichy?

00:04:47.155 --> 00:04:47.905
Karl Josephy: From Vichy.

00:04:47.905 --> 00:04:51.171
David Boder: Yes. And what kind of work did you do there?

00:04:51.171 --> 00:05:04.568
Karl Josephy: We smashed stones, we smashed large blocks of stone, which were destined as ballast [word not clear] – for the erection of the rail line that should lead down to Congo, ah ...

00:05:04.568 --> 00:05:05.173
David Boder: Yes...

00:05:05.173 --> 00:05:13.668
Karl Josephy: ... for the, ah, well, was for the building of the rail line, the Noballa[? word not clear] – and [we] had to work in the heat of 40 to 60 degrees [Celsius] ...

00:05:13.668 --> 00:05:15.785
David Boder: Yes, please tell us effects ... [? speech not clear]

00:05:15.785 --> 00:05:18.144
Karl Josephy: ... certainly no shade to speak of ...

00:05:18.144 --> 00:05:18.840
David Boder: Yes ...

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:29.782
Karl Josephy: ... and these works had to be executed in record time, and under, and under supervision of the French sergeants [? word not clear]

00:05:29.782 --> 00:05:34.252
David Boder: Yes. Now, what was paid for that [work]?

00:05:34.252 --> 00:05:37.300
Karl Josephy: We were paid one Franc per day.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.966
David Boder: Yes ...

00:05:37.966 --> 00:05:40.833
Karl Josephy: .... and this money always arrived very late.

00:05:40.833 --> 00:05:43.065
David Boder: And what did one get to eat?

00:05:43.065 --> 00:05:48.230
Karl Josephy: ... The food was not sufficient for this hard labor.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.464
David Boder: Yes, ah ... but they provided the food, right?

00:05:52.464 --> 00:05:59.753
Karl Josephy: The food was [transported] from the labor camp, 5 km away from the, from the ...

00:05:59.753 --> 00:06:00.473
David Boder: ... construction site ...

00:06:00.473 --> 00:06:08.330
Karl Josephy: ... [which was situated away from the ] construction site, and was transported in trucks, and, ah, as well as the water provisions.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.830
David Boder: Aha. What did they give you to eat, for instance, in the morning?

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.761
Karl Josephy: In the morning there was black coffee and a piece of bread, and that was it.

00:06:16.761 --> 00:06:18.878
David Boder: And, ah, sugar?

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:23.929
Karl Josephy: The coffee was [? not clearly audible] – there was maybe a hint of sweetness in it.

00:06:23.929 --> 00:06:25.163
David Boder: That was sugared [? not clearly audible].

00:06:25.163 --> 00:06:25.792
Karl Josephy: Yes.

00:06:25.792 --> 00:06:29.754
David Boder: Now, and at noon, at one o’clock, lunch time?

00:06:29.754 --> 00:06:38.881
Karl Josephy: Well, at that time we received a soup, a piece of meat, some vegetables, and occasionally a couple of wine —

00:06:38.881 --> 00:06:39.637
David Boder: .... a little wine.

00:06:39.637 --> 00:06:41.028
Karl Josephy: .... a little wine.

00:06:41.028 --> 00:06:47.923
David Boder: So, ah, how was that served? Did you eat in a dining hall or in a —- where did you eat?

00:06:47.923 --> 00:06:52.067
Karl Josephy: ... in no way, since there was no dining room.

00:06:52.067 --> 00:06:52.484
David Boder: Yes ...

00:06:52.484 --> 00:06:59.924
Karl Josephy: We lived in burrows that we had dug ourselves because the terrible immense heat made it impossible to live in tents ...

00:06:59.924 --> 00:07:00.160
David Boder: Oh ...

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:11.525
Karl Josephy: ... and we retreated into these burrows, you know, during our lunch break, very exhausted, and wolfed down the meals from our military gamellen, just as it was.

00:07:11.525 --> 00:07:13.666
David Boder: What are ‘gamellen’, dinnerware?

00:07:13.666 --> 00:07:17.840
Karl Josephy: That’s the old military cookware, mess tin sets that we kept from the wartime.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.191
David Boder: Who was with you, what kinds of people were with you?

00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:36.397
Karl Josephy: Those were all Jewish volunteers from France who, just like me, did not have the required money or the required papers to be demobilized immediately.

00:07:36.397 --> 00:07:41.744
David Boder: Aha – were there just Jews in the whole construction thing?

00:07:41.744 --> 00:07:44.853
Karl Josephy: There were five groups of Jews ...

00:07:44.853 --> 00:07:45.663
David Boder: Yes ...

00:07:45.663 --> 00:08:07.317
Karl Josephy: ... and furthermore several groups of Republican Spaniards who had fled to France after the overthrow in Spain, and there – and from there were relocated to Africa to also do forced labor, ah, with almost no payment and under the same circumstances as we [had to].

00:08:07.317 --> 00:08:12.180
David Boder: Aha. Now, how long did that last?

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:31.589
Karl Josephy: I was in Guarta [?] that is, the starting point of the rail that was supposed to lead to the Congo, that was supposed to lead to the Congo and Niger, from December 21, 1940, to July 19, 1941, exactly.

00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:34.190
David Boder: Yes. Where was your wife?

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.042
Karl Josephy: I was not married at that time.

00:08:36.042 --> 00:08:40.760
David Boder: You were not married yet. What happened then, when you were done with that work?

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:52.252
Karl Josephy: I was demobilized on July 19, after a long wait, after I was sent the required papers, and after I borrowed the required 10,000 Francs.

00:08:52.252 --> 00:08:53.431
David Boder: From where, from whom?

00:08:53.431 --> 00:08:58.179
Karl Josephy: A friend [Josephy uses the term Kollege=colleague, commonly used as synonym for friend] lent me [the money] to enable me to return to France.

00:08:58.179 --> 00:09:03.508
David Boder: What was the franc worth then? [In comparison] to the Dollar?

00:09:03.508 --> 00:09:04.355
Karl Josephy: I couldn’t tell you now ...

00:09:04.355 --> 00:09:05.801
David Boder: .... approximately ...

00:09:05.801 --> 00:00:00.000
Karl Josephy: In those times ...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:09:07.216
David Boder: [unclear]

00:09:07.216 --> 00:09:12.932
Karl Josephy: We have to bear in mind, isn’t it, that the relation was something like 1 : 60 ...

00:09:12.932 --> 00:09:13.234
David Boder: 1 : 60

00:09:13.234 --> 00:09:14.172
Karl Josephy: 1 : 60, yeah ...

00:09:14.172 --> 00:09:15.013
David Boder: Yes, approximately ...

00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:15.551
Karl Josephy: Yeah. Yeah.

00:09:15.551 --> 00:09:19.241
David Boder: And who else had the money?

00:09:19.241 --> 00:09:24.104
Karl Josephy: There were, after all, some colleagues, who had the money sent from France ...

00:09:24.104 --> 00:09:24.491
David Boder: Oh ...

00:09:24.491 --> 00:09:26.578
Karl Josephy: ... also in order to get demobilized ...

00:09:26.578 --> 00:09:26.784
David Boder: Oh ...

00:09:26.784 --> 00:09:40.084
Karl Josephy: ... because hardly anyone of us was in possession of cash. The people who worked in Africa were 90 percent poor refugees from Germany, Austria, Poland, and Belgium.

00:09:40.084 --> 00:09:48.159
David Boder: Aha. So, then, a friend lent you the money and you posted ... [fraction, word omitted] the bond – have you ever received the bond back?

00:09:48.159 --> 00:09:56.061
Karl Josephy: This bond was more a kind of “face money”, that means that at the moment where I furnished the money, I got it back in my hand ...

00:09:56.061 --> 00:09:56.303
David Boder: Oh ...

00:09:56.303 --> 00:09:57.785
Karl Josephy: ... and restituted it immediately.

00:09:57.785 --> 00:10:01.408
David Boder: ... and you paid it, well. So you just got the money to show it ....

00:10:01.408 --> 00:10:03.519
Karl Josephy: ... to show it to accounting [sic].

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:05.842
David Boder: Ah. So, where did you go then?

00:10:05.842 --> 00:10:14.062
Karl Josephy: Since I had nobody in France, I stated the Department of Gard as my residence.

00:10:14.062 --> 00:10:15.235
David Boder: .... and where is Gard?

00:10:15.235 --> 00:10:20.679
Karl Josephy: Gard is a small department in the south of France with Nimes as the capital.

00:10:20.679 --> 00:10:22.790
David Boder: ... how far from Spain?

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:25.324
Karl Josephy: ... ah, from Spain, 400 kilometers.

00:10:25.324 --> 00:10:27.562
David Boder: Yes - how far from Lyon – or Marseilles?

00:10:27.562 --> 00:10:29.437
Karl Josephy: ... from Marseilles, 50 kilometers.

00:10:29.437 --> 00:10:33.060
David Boder: Aha, well ... that is not far from the Mediterranean sea then ...

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.448
Karl Josephy: Yes, yes, well in the south ...

00:10:36.448 --> 00:10:36.714
David Boder: Aha.

00:10:36.714 --> 00:10:40.101
Karl Josephy: ... you know, with a southern climate, in the sourthern zone of France ...

00:10:40.101 --> 00:10:43.186
David Boder: So go on, then – and? You established yourself, and then what did you do?

00:10:43.186 --> 00:10:49.289
Karl Josephy: In the Department of Gard I did hard labor, I carried coals, I split wood ...

00:10:49.289 --> 00:10:49.948
David Boder: ... but that was unforced labor ...

00:10:49.948 --> 00:10:52.882
Karl Josephy: ... because I was without money ... that was unforced labor indeed ...

00:10:52.882 --> 00:10:54.358
David Boder: ... and you were paid for this ...

00:10:54.358 --> 00:10:59.372
Karl Josephy: I was paid for it, I worked very hard, but I made my living ...

00:10:59.372 --> 00:10:59.765
David Boder: Yes ...

00:10:59.765 --> 00:11:12.134
Karl Josephy: ... and I was well respected everywhere. People knew that I was a former intellectual, and I was treated very well accordingly with respect, even if I had to work hard ... [pause]

00:11:12.134 --> 00:11:18.756
David Boder: So go on, now what happened to you then? How did that end?

00:11:18.756 --> 00:11:38.831
Karl Josephy: The situation worsened from the moment of Lavale taking office who through the contracts with Germany put pressure on all unwanted elements, especially the Jews. ...

00:11:38.831 --> 00:11:41.244
David Boder: Yes ... and then?

00:11:41.244 --> 00:11:49.047
Karl Josephy: So therefore about two months after my wedding, I ...

00:11:49.047 --> 00:11:50.462
David Boder: Who did you, when did you marry?

00:11:50.462 --> 00:11:53.940
Karl Josephy: I got married in June of ’42.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:55.634
David Boder: Who did you marry?

00:11:55.634 --> 00:12:01.102
Karl Josephy: My wife is, ah, Polish, who had lived in Austria before, and ...

00:12:01.102 --> 00:12:01.640
David Boder: A Jew?

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.366
Karl Josephy: A Jew ...

00:12:02.366 --> 00:12:02.910
David Boder: Yes ...

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:07.447
Karl Josephy: ... who was all alone in France ...

00:12:07.447 --> 00:12:08.016
David Boder: Yes ...

00:12:08.016 --> 00:12:14.572
Karl Josephy: ...and, ah, who was totally on her own, but made a living with tailoring and seamstress work.

00:12:14.572 --> 00:12:15.298
David Boder: ... hmhm ...

00:12:15.298 --> 00:12:21.982
Karl Josephy: Since our fate was similar, it did not take long, and we got married..

00:12:21.982 --> 00:12:26.119
David Boder: Yes? Now ... and what does that do now?

00:12:26.119 --> 00:12:58.513
Karl Josephy: Because we did not live together because of a certain shortage of apartments, it happened that on August 24, 1942 at 2.30 in the morning I was awakened by my wife who was accompanied by two inspectors of the gendarmerie. They gave us 10 minutes to pack our belongings and to get on a truck that was standing by to drive us down to Nimes ...

00:12:58.513 --> 00:12:59.058
David Boder: And why ...

00:12:59.058 --> 00:12:59.838
Karl Josephy: ... so to drive us down ...

00:12:59.838 --> 00:13:05.493
David Boder: ... was that a general arrest then, or were you just selected?

00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:15.594
Karl Josephy: ... all Jews, actually there were only 8 in the little town I lived in, were taken in the night without prior, ah, without prior warning ...

00:13:15.594 --> 00:13:15.957
David Boder: Warning...

00:13:15.957 --> 00:13:27.240
Karl Josephy: ... warning, taken out of their beds so that we could be transported without it being noticed much, and unfortunately we had a pretty good idea what that could mean.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.895
David Boder: How, ah, why did one know that you were Jews?

00:13:29.895 --> 00:13:38.605
Karl Josephy: That was known because the Jews in France back then, that is , since the Vichy regime, were forced to give a declaration as Jews.

00:13:38.605 --> 00:13:41.895
David Boder: Aha. Now, and where were you sent then?

00:13:41.895 --> 00:13:43.438
Karl Josephy: From there I was ...

00:13:43.438 --> 00:13:44.279
David Boder: ... with your wife ...

00:13:44.279 --> 00:13:52.287
Karl Josephy: ... together with my wife, we were sent in a, in a truck to Nimes, so 15 kilometers to the south ...

00:13:52.287 --> 00:13:52.741
David Boder: Yes ...

00:13:52.741 --> 00:14:08.672
Karl Josephy: ... to await a furthter transort from there. In Nimes there were already several thousand Jews who had been rounded up in the Department and in the neighbor Department who were waiting for their transport to a central collection camp.

00:14:08.672 --> 00:14:09.852
David Boder: ... and ...

00:14:09.852 --> 00:14:10.723
Karl Josephy: This transport ...

00:14:10.723 --> 00:14:13.499
David Boder: ... that was before the Germans had taken, ah, Nimes?

00:14:13.499 --> 00:14:24.417
Karl Josephy: Oh yes, that was still in August of ’42, so before the Germans entered the free zone, thus finally occupying all of France ...

00:14:24.417 --> 00:14:27.012
David Boder: America was not yet ... it was ‘42

00:14:27.012 --> 00:14:27.853
Karl Josephy: That was ’42, yes ...

00:14:27.853 --> 00:14:29.359
David Boder: ... so America was already in the war?

00:14:29.359 --> 00:14:30.811
Karl Josephy: America had entered the war, yes.

00:14:30.811 --> 00:14:33.194
David Boder: Yes, and then?

00:14:33.194 --> 00:14:44.111
Karl Josephy: From Nimes we were - all under heavy guard and only equipped with some food that had been provided from the Jewish congregation in Nimes ...

00:14:44.111 --> 00:14:47.589
David Boder: What, the congregation stayed, wasn’t the congregation arrested?

00:14:47.589 --> 00:14:55.589
Karl Josephy: There were some members of it, the boards members, who stayed, but all of those were dependent on the Gestapo ...

00:14:55.589 --> 00:14:56.158
David Boder: Yes ...

00:14:56.158 --> 00:15:00.053
Karl Josephy: ... and within ... and were not able to act as they wanted ...

00:15:00.053 --> 00:15:00.295
David Boder: Yes ...

00:15:00.295 --> 00:15:03.803
Karl Josephy: These were French ...

00:15:03.803 --> 00:15:04.559
David Boder: ... French Jews ...

00:15:04.559 --> 00:15:10.668
Karl Josephy: ...French Jews, because at first only the Jews, the foreign Jews ...-

00:15:10.668 --> 00:15:11.454
David Boder: ... were taken ...

00:15:11.454 --> 00:15:12.150
Karl Josephy: ... were taken.

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:13.686
David Boder: Yes, and then?

00:15:13.686 --> 00:15:23.030
Karl Josephy: From there we were [cough] ... from the train station of Nimes we were transported to Les Milles which a small town near Aix ...

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.394
David Boder: Yes ...

00:15:23.394 --> 00:15:25.838
Karl Josephy: ... so only 40 kilometers from Marseille ...

00:15:25.838 --> 00:15:26.195
David Boder: Yes ...

00:15:26.195 --> 00:15:51.858
Karl Josephy: There was a big brick factory that could hold some 5,000 to 6,000 people. There were simple straw mats, all made very, ah, very primitive, and this camp was only designated to expedite the Jews who were interned there, without much, much ado to the notorius Camp of Drancy ...

00:15:51.858 --> 00:15:52.191
David Boder: Yes ...

00:15:52.191 --> 00:15:53.274
Karl Josephy: ... to take them there ...

00:15:53.274 --> 00:15:53.510
David Boder: Yes ...

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:56.468
Karl Josephy: ... and finally to deport them from there to Germany ...

00:15:56.468 --> 00:15:57.364
David Boder: Yes ...

00:15:57.364 --> 00:15:58.598
Karl Josephy: We were there ...

00:15:58.598 --> 00:16:02.614
David Boder: Were you still together with your wife, or were men and women already separated?

00:16:02.614 --> 00:16:08.445
Karl Josephy: We were always – I was always together with my wife, only the sleeping quarters were separated ...

00:16:08.445 --> 00:16:09.897
David Boder: ... aha, yes, and then?

00:16:09.897 --> 00:16:11.585
Karl Josephy: ... so then, ah, there were ...

00:16:11.585 --> 00:16:12.819
David Boder: ... did you have to work? ...

00:16:12.819 --> 00:16:36.771
Karl Josephy: I did not have to work there, but I did, ah, little jobs there because I had no personal funds, for older Gentlemen I certainly did it for free, but when I was called to a job that was more difficult or in the common interest, I was paid a small amount from the camp direction.

00:16:36.771 --> 00:16:38.458
David Boder: The camp leaders were Jewish?

00:16:38.458 --> 00:16:56.815
Karl Josephy: The camp leaders were not Jewish, the camp leaders were totally dependent on Vichy... Among them, or the majority I should say were people who treated us extremely harshly, you know, who would not make any exceptions for us and did not care about the health situation of the people ...

00:16:56.815 --> 00:17:00.717
David Boder: But still you were being paid something ...

00:17:00.717 --> 00:17:02.374
Karl Josephy: ... yes, to a certain extent...

00:17:02.374 --> 00:17:07.364
David Boder: ... yes, well now – and how long were you there und what happened there?

00:17:07.364 --> 00:17:45.076
Karl Josephy: I -– there were horrible scenes, especially in the moments, where people were taken out, out of their quarters, where the names were called of those to be deported ...There were suicides, there were people who tried to hide ...And so, of course, it could have been that my wife and I were deported. However, we were able to take advantage of a lucky circumstance. We were able to take advantage by a decree from Vichy that people with children under two years woud not be deported ...

00:17:45.076 --> 00:17:45.947
David Boder: Yes ...

00:17:45.947 --> 00:17:51.868
Karl Josephy: We were so lucky because thank God we had the documents about our child with us ...

00:17:51.868 --> 00:17:53.562
David Boder: You already had a child back then?

00:17:53.562 --> 00:17:58.485
Karl Josephy: We had a child and we got married because of the unpredictable circumstances, you know ...

00:17:58.485 --> 00:17:58.727
David Boder: Yes ...

00:17:58.727 --> 00:17:59.877
David Boder: ... and how old was the child?

00:17:59.877 --> 00:18:02.169
Karl Josephy: ... we got married later ...

00:18:02.169 --> 00:18:04.165
Karl Josephy: ... the child was a year and ten months old.

00:18:04.165 --> 00:18:06.948
David Boder: Was the child born before your marriage? No?

00:18:06.948 --> 00:18:07.910
Karl Josephy: The child was born before we got married.

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:09.325
David Boder: Yes, and then you got married ...

00:18:09.325 --> 00:18:11.200
Karl Josephy: Yes, and then we legalized the child ...

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:11.412
David Boder: Yes ...

00:18:11.412 --> 00:18:16.341
Karl Josephy: It was at this time, that we were refugees ourselves, where I was in Africa ...

00:18:16.341 --> 00:18:16.493
David Boder: Yes ...

00:18:16.493 --> 00:00:00.000
Karl Josephy: ... and my wife somewhere else, you know ...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:18:18.543
David Boder: Yes ...

00:18:18.543 --> 00:18:21.779
Karl Josephy: ... that there were no chance to take care of the formalities ...

00:18:21.779 --> 00:18:21.930
David Boder: Yes ...

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:23.261
Karl Josephy: ... as it should have been...

00:18:23.261 --> 00:18:23.957
David Boder: Yes, and then ...

00:18:23.957 --> 00:00:00.000
Karl Josephy: This child has ...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:18:25.524
David Boder: Yes ...

00:18:25.524 --> 00:18:27.544
Karl Josephy: ... without exaggeration saved our lives ...

00:18:27.544 --> 00:18:27.998
David Boder: Yes ...

00:18:27.998 --> 00:18:47.921
Karl Josephy: ... because, ah, we were, ah, we were not freed as I wanted, repeatedly stressing that I had been a former volunteer for France, because that, ah that was not seen in my favor, and I know that engagee voluntaires were deported to Germany ...

00:18:47.921 --> 00:18:49.464
David Boder: Well?

00:18:49.464 --> 00:19:03.823
Karl Josephy: From there we were sent to another camp, and were told that that was a great , a great luck to get there. That was indeed the case, because of all inmates of this horrible camp ...

00:19:03.823 --> 00:19:05.994
David Boder: What was the name of the camp?

00:19:05.994 --> 00:19:06.932
Karl Josephy: Les Milles ... [he refers to the former camp]

00:19:06.932 --> 00:19:08.226
David Boder: ...the horrible camp ...

00:19:08.226 --> 00:19:11.432
Karl Josephy: That is a ... I call that a horrible camp without exaggeration ...

00:19:11.432 --> 00:19:14.003
David Boder: Well ... ... and then, where were you sent then?

00:19:14.003 --> 00:19:19.289
Karl Josephy: I was sent from there to another camp, to ...

00:19:19.289 --> 00:19:19.864
David Boder: Yes ...

00:19:19.864 --> 00:19:22.277
Karl Josephy: Are we interrupting, or ... ? ... [interruption]

00:19:22.277 --> 00:19:23.064
David Boder: Now ...

00:19:23.064 --> 00:19:42.534
Karl Josephy: So we were transported from there to another camp, always under heavy guard, and there – there were about 40 other people who for one reason or another had managed to escape their certain deportation and be interned in another camp.

00:19:42.534 --> 00:19:43.224
David Boder: ... and then ...

00:19:43.224 --> 00:19:55.799
Karl Josephy: This other camp was the camp of Noé [?] in the Department Haute Garonne ... About the camp one can say that the treatment was extremely harsh ...

00:19:55.799 --> 00:19:56.821
David Boder: French?

00:19:56.821 --> 00:19:58.091
Karl Josephy: French. Yes.

00:19:58.091 --> 00:19:58.303
David Boder: Yes ...

00:19:58.303 --> 00:20:13.545
Karl Josephy: The treatment was extremely harsh, the food situation was a catastrophe ... Concerning the food we were depending on donations from the Secours National (?) and the beginning [engagement] of the American Quakers ...

00:20:13.545 --> 00:20:15.081
David Boder: What is the Secours National...

00:20:15.081 --> 00:20:32.985
Karl Josephy: The Secours National, yes, that is the French charity, ah agency if you will, that occasionally sent us packages or some food, certain cheap foods, you know, which had the good purpose of bettering our much to insufficient food..

00:20:32.985 --> 00:20:35.670
David Boder: ... and the Quakers were also there during the war?

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:58.677
Karl Josephy: That is a very interesting thing – the Quakers had wanted to establish themselves with us, and had sent help in the form of food. But when they wanted to finally establish themselves in the camp, despite the war, in order to help the poor inmates, it was denied.

00:20:58.677 --> 00:21:00.092
David Boder: ... hmhm – and then?

00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:03.086
Karl Josephy: ... ah, regarding the hygiene in this camp ...

00:21:03.086 --> 00:21:03.177
David Boder: ... one moment?

00:21:03.177 --> 00:21:05.748
Karl Josephy: ... yes, please [unintelligible (speak here?)] &gt;

00:21:05.748 --> 00:21:29.996
Karl Josephy: Regarding the hygiene in this camp, I can say we were not to bad off in wooden barracks, there were showers, so the sanitary situation was taken care of. But I say it again and again, it was the food situation that was the catastrophe. People died and it was claimed that they had intestinal disease – but they simply starved to death.

00:21:29.996 --> 00:21:33.075
David Boder: Yes – now tell me, were you still together with your wife?

00:21:33.075 --> 00:21:45.468
Karl Josephy: I was still together with my wife, and made desperate attempts to legally free myself from the camp, by filing motions, by referring to my fate and to my child ...

00:21:45.468 --> 00:21:45.801
David Boder: Yes ...

00:21:45.801 --> 00:21:48.033
Karl Josephy: ... and hoped to get free.

00:21:48.033 --> 00:21:49.781
David Boder: Now, how did you feed the child?

00:21:49.781 --> 00:21:57.638
Karl Josephy: I could not feed the child because it was not with us. The child was taken earlier by my wife to the OSE organization.

00:21:57.638 --> 00:21:58.146
David Boder: ... ohh ...

00:21:58.146 --> 00:22:01.049
Karl Josephy: ... the large organization that without doubt is well known ...

00:22:01.049 --> 00:22:06.735
David Boder: ...ohh ... so, when did you separate from the child? Was that long ago ...?

00:22:06.735 --> 00:22:16.376
Karl Josephy: I separated from my –- I was separated from my child already after my, already after the birth of the child, because I was still in Africa. I was in Africa, I was only on leave ...

00:22:16.376 --> 00:22:21.185
David Boder: No, I mean, when was the child separated from the mother?

00:22:21.185 --> 00:22:28.044
Karl Josephy: That was ... [pause] ... in October of ’41.

00:22:28.044 --> 00:22:28.613
David Boder: Aha...

00:22:28.613 --> 00:22:29.242
Karl Josephy: In October of 1941 ...

00:22:29.242 --> 00:22:32.327
David Boder: But in the first camp you were in, was the child with you then?

00:22:32.327 --> 00:22:34.105
Karl Josephy: The child was never in the camp with us.

00:22:34.105 --> 00:22:39.821
David Boder: Ohh, but still, since you, ah, had the child, you could not be deported ...

00:22:39.821 --> 00:22:41.508
Karl Josephy: No, I could, for the time being, not be deported.

00:22:41.508 --> 00:22:45.803
David Boder: Now, how did the OSE function during the war?

00:22:45.803 --> 00:23:03.488
Karl Josephy: The OSE has — OSE functioned exceptionally well, that is to say, it was often informed in advance by the Jews that were anticipating bad things to happen, so that it should take care of the little children because no one wanted to take the children along into the camps if it was at all preventable.

00:23:03.488 --> 00:23:06.422
David Boder: Yes, and so, were was the child housed?

00:23:06.422 --> 00:23:11.618
Karl Josephy: The child was housed in [Elne?] a little place in the Pyrenees.

00:23:11.618 --> 00:23:12.005
David Boder: ... with ...

00:23:12.005 --> 00:23:12.398
Karl Josephy: ... was ...

00:23:12.398 --> 00:23:13.154
David Boder: ... with whom?

00:23:13.154 --> 00:23:16.299
Karl Josephy: ... was accommodated in a home of the Red Cross.

00:23:16.299 --> 00:23:16.693
David Boder: Oh ...

00:23:16.693 --> 00:23:18.108
Karl Josephy: Croix Rouge Francaise.

00:23:18.108 --> 00:23:18.441
David Boder: Yes ...

00:23:18.441 --> 00:23:22.215
Karl Josephy: You know ... the child was brought there through the mediation of the OSE.

00:23:22.215 --> 00:23:25.118
David Boder: Aha ...well, go on, please.

00:23:25.118 --> 00:23:39.423
Karl Josephy: We made several legal attempts to get freed that unfortunately failed because the Prefect of my former Department flatly denied me the stay, that is, my return.

00:23:39.423 --> 00:23:41.262
David Boder: Yes ...

00:23:41.262 --> 00:23:49.210
Karl Josephy: Later I motioned to be put in a so-called Groupement des Travailleurs Etrangers (foreign workers group.)

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:49.537
David Boder: Yes ...

00:23:49.537 --> 00:23:56.093
Karl Josephy: Those were groups of foreign Jews, also Spaniards, I mean of foreigners ...

00:23:56.093 --> 00:23:56.366
David Boder: Yes ...

00:23:56.366 --> 00:24:15.201
Karl Josephy: ... groups of destitute foreigners who because they were in some group were monitored by the state, and who were doing labor that served the public good, that occasionally had barracks available, and overall were kept pretty well.

00:24:15.201 --> 00:24:17.070
David Boder: Were you able to take your wife along then?

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:21.449
Karl Josephy: I was not able to take my wife along because this was not designed for women. So I ...

00:24:21.449 --> 00:24:21.691
David Boder: Aha ...

00:24:21.691 --> 00:24:50.850
Karl Josephy: ... I received word in February, to report to one of those camps, a Groupement des Travailleurs Etrangers, and of course I picked a camp in close proximity to my wife because we intended to free my wife as soon as I had the freedom to make my living outside. This was actually a possibility for us, but most often only in theory. ...

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:53.179
David Boder: Yes –and then?

00:24:53.179 --> 00:25:38.456
Karl Josephy: I have — so I was transferred from the camp in Noé to another camp, the Groupement von Septfonds [?], Septfonds in Tarn-et-Garonne. That was approximately 100 kilometers away from Noé, so unfortunately too far from my wife, where I originally wanted to - where I wanted to visit her and take steps to free her. The circumstances in Septfonds were scandalous, we had no freedom, we had to break stones .... [fragments] ...of exactly ... was impossible, we had, ah ... and we were subjected to all kinds of harassments under a markedly anti-semitic boss.

00:25:38.456 --> 00:25:39.545
David Boder: French?

00:25:39.545 --> 00:25:40.386
Karl Josephy: French.

00:25:40.386 --> 00:25:40.894
David Boder: And then?

00:25:40.894 --> 00:25:50.783
Karl Josephy: I can also tell you the name, you know. This man was punished, you know, just as the camp commander of Noé, you know, severely punished because of colla-, collaboration ...

00:25:50.783 --> 00:25:52.537
David Boder: What do you call severely punished?

00:25:52.537 --> 00:25:57.346
Karl Josephy: Well, he got, first of all he was interned himself, und will also probably have received physical punishment.

00:25:57.346 --> 00:26:00.848
David Boder: Ah –well. Resume.

00:26:00.848 --> 00:26:08.620
Karl Josephy: In the - in the – During the stay at Septfonds began the famous deportations from Noé on ...

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:10.556
David Boder: Now, that was where your wife was ...

00:26:10.556 --> 00:26:13.756
Karl Josephy: No, not where my wife was, there were deportations from there, too ...

00:26:13.756 --> 00:26:13.901
David Boder: Yes ...

00:26:13.901 --> 00:26:19.103
Karl Josephy: The deportations continued without interruptions from the moment of my arrest ...

00:26:19.103 --> 00:26:19.339
David Boder: Aha.

00:26:19.339 --> 00:26:22.055
Karl Josephy: We only had a little protection through our child.

00:26:22.055 --> 00:26:23.017
David Boder: Yes –- and then?

00:26:23.017 --> 00:26:48.188
Karl Josephy: I lived through an especially horrible time in Septfonds from the end of February to the beginning of March of 1943. Fact is that, at the end, from the approximately 200 camp inmates only 20 men were left. Nobody was spared, not fathers with family, not French, not people with French relatives, there was no mercy ...

00:26:48.188 --> 00:26:51.001
David Boder: What, there were French there?

00:26:51.001 --> 00:27:05.481
Karl Josephy: There were indeed some people that had French relatives or claimed to be French. Don’t forget that there was also a special camp Septfonds in which suspicious political elements were held.

00:27:05.481 --> 00:27:08.923
David Boder: Yes, and then?

00:27:08.923 --> 00:27:22.526
Karl Josephy: So due to the continuing deportations the camp of Septfonds was emptied down to 20 people, and it is a wonder that I myself was among them.

00:27:22.526 --> 00:27:22.701
David Boder: And then?

00:27:22.701 --> 00:27:42.843
Karl Josephy: At this time I filed a motion to free my wife. This ‘demande’ was later found in the waste paper basket of Mr. Demoulin, Demoulin, the Mr. camp commander, who had seriously told me to my face that he would do everything he could, and then tossed it immediately into the trash, and the remains of my motion into the waste paper basket ...

00:27:42.843 --> 00:27:43.170
David Boder: ... tossed ...

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:44.464
Karl Josephy: ... tossed it.

00:27:44.464 --> 00:27:46.763
David Boder: ... and then?

00:27:46.763 --> 00:27:59.126
Karl Josephy: ... ah, the situation in, in the camp of Septfonds still worsened and became more and more untenable, at the end we were denied any leave because so many escapes occurred ...

00:27:59.126 --> 00:28:00.934
David Boder: ... hmhm ...

00:28:00.934 --> 00:28:24.741
Karl Josephy: Finally we, ah, an inspector came that requested workers for lumber work in the woods in the Department of Cantal, and offered us to apply. So the few people who were left in the camp did not hesitate a moment to request to be transferred from this hell of Septfonds.

00:28:24.741 --> 00:28:25.346
David Boder: Yes ...

00:28:25.346 --> 00:28:34.987
Karl Josephy: And so I relocated on July 14, 1943 to Cantal, still as a Groupement des Travailleurs Etrangers ...

00:28:34.987 --> 00:28:37.467
David Boder: What kind of woodworking did you know?

00:28:37.467 --> 00:28:49.951
Karl Josephy: We knew nothing about lumber, it was, we were all just amateurs if you will, none of us really knew how to really handle an axe or a saw. The work ...

00:28:49.951 --> 00:28:51.336
David Boder: ... were ...

00:28:51.336 --> 00:28:51.790
Karl Josephy: ... yes ...

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:52.238
David Boder: ... yes ...

00:28:52.238 --> 00:28:56.526
Karl Josephy: The work consisted of felling trees in the forest ...

00:28:56.526 --> 00:28:56.647
David Boder: ... aha ...

00:28:56.647 --> 00:29:04.480
Karl Josephy: The trees had to be felled, hewn and trimmed. Of course, that was hard work, but it was relatively well paid.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.198
David Boder: Oh, you were paid for that work?

00:29:06.198 --> 00:29:06.797
Karl Josephy: Yes, I was ...

00:29:06.797 --> 00:29:06.972
David Boder: Yes ...

00:29:06.972 --> 00:29:13.112
Karl Josephy: Yes, this Groupement was very decent. We were paid according to the same pay scale as French workers ...

00:29:13.112 --> 00:29:14.376
David Boder: Yes ...

00:29:14.376 --> 00:29:30.404
Karl Josephy: ... and we lived together in barracks. After work we were completely free to roam. We also received clothing from the Groupement. And if we had not been so isolated from the rest of the civilization, we would have been quite happy there – and ...

00:29:30.404 --> 00:29:31.675
David Boder: How much was paid per day?

00:29:31.675 --> 00:29:34.602
Karl Josephy: The pay was 9 Francs per hour.

00:29:34.602 --> 00:29:34.905
David Boder: Yes ...

00:29:34.905 --> 00:29:38.437
Karl Josephy: And, ah, to make 70 to 80 Francs ...

00:29:38.437 --> 00:29:38.861
David Boder: ... the ...

00:29:38.861 --> 00:29:39.339
Karl Josephy: ... was possible.

00:29:39.339 --> 00:29:42.750
David Boder: Yes – and you had to buy your own food?

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:58.295
Karl Josephy: The food was paid by ourselves, we were charged 40 Francs per day, maybe a high price at that time, but we had excellent food and I have to say that since my return to France from Africa I had not eaten that well.

00:29:58.295 --> 00:29:58.803
David Boder: And then?

00:29:58.803 --> 00:30:00.194
Karl Josephy: ... ah ...

00:30:00.194 --> 00:30:02.190
David Boder: ... and how far were you away from your wife?

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:07.936
Karl Josephy: ... I was now far away from my wife, 300 kilometers approximately if you will.

00:30:07.936 --> 00:30:11.414
David Boder: ... so you were far away from your wife. And then?

00:30:11.414 --> 00:30:23.958
Karl Josephy: Of course I initiated steps to free my wife from the terrible camp, in the meantime, I of course sent her packages so that her, her, ah, situation ...

00:30:23.958 --> 00:30:24.714
David Boder: ...improved.

00:30:24.714 --> 00:30:26.378
Karl Josephy: ... improved.

00:30:26.378 --> 00:30:28.791
David Boder: ... what, were the packages let through?

00:30:28.791 --> 00:30:41.584
Karl Josephy: All packages were, ah, inspected in the camp of Noé, and if too much bread or meat or other precious food were found, they would just be confiscated.

00:30:41.584 --> 00:30:43.937
David Boder: Yes ... [not audible]

00:30:43.937 --> 00:30:47.893
Karl Josephy: That is not good ... Pardon.

00:30:47.893 --> 00:30:50.246
David Boder: ... So? Oh well – and then?

00:30:50.246 --> 00:30:50.482
Karl Josephy: ... ah ...

00:30:50.482 --> 00:30:53.198
David Boder: ... now ... turn yourself to the device here.

00:30:53.198 --> 00:30:53.525
Karl Josephy: ... yes ...

00:30:53.525 --> 00:30:56.059
David Boder: ... and then?

00:30:56.059 --> 00:31:13.781
Karl Josephy: I, ah, as I said I sent my wife packages and, ah, took steps to let her go free because now there was evidence that I could earn a living and that I could also support my wife with my salary ...

00:31:13.781 --> 00:31:14.446
David Boder: Yes ...

00:31:14.446 --> 00:31:30.877
Karl Josephy: I presented this request to my boss from the lumber department. He deemed it very good and forwarded it immediately. And now I had indeed some hope that my wife would be freed.

00:31:30.877 --> 00:31:31.512
David Boder: Yes ...

00:31:31.512 --> 00:31:52.285
Karl Josephy: This was indeed the case, and I still thank God to this day, because it became clear afterwards that 15 days after the release all people from my wife’s barrack and the adjacent one were deported to Germany, a fate she also would definitely have endured had she not been freed.

00:31:52.285 --> 00:31:56.065
David Boder: Now – where did you go from there?

00:31:56.065 --> 00:32:17.567
Karl Josephy: I was ... because the work in the woods was to hard for me, because I suffered, ah terrible muscle pain and because I was, ah, not fit for this work because of a little heart defect ... I was transferred to a factory that produced wood chairs, wooden arm chairs, and toys for children.

00:32:17.567 --> 00:32:18.233
David Boder: Yes ...

00:32:18.233 --> 00:32:24.215
Karl Josephy: I also had to work hard, harder there, but at least I had a roof over my head, and had ...

00:32:24.215 --> 00:32:27.898
David Boder: Was that, ah, after America entered the war?

00:32:27.898 --> 00:32:29.048
Karl Josephy: Yes, yes, that was ...

00:32:29.048 --> 00:32:30.856
David Boder: So the Germans were in all of France already?

00:32:30.856 --> 00:32:33.397
Karl Josephy: At this time the Germans were in all of France.

00:32:33.397 --> 00:32:34.087
David Boder: Yes ...

00:32:34.087 --> 00:32:45.391
Karl Josephy: And of course there was terrible pressure on the population. Especially the Jews did their utmost to hide themselves, you know, as best as they could.

00:32:45.391 --> 00:32:47.055
David Boder: Yes – and then?

00:32:47.055 --> 00:33:16.620
Karl Josephy: So I, ah, stayed in this factory that was not far from my original lumber job. Until August 20 – until April of 1944. That means a little longer than the final – no ... I stayed there until April 20, 1945, so a little longer than the liberation.

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:17.098
David Boder: Yes ...

00:33:17.098 --> 00:33:41.454
Karl Josephy: During these, during this time I received a letter from the prefecture in Cantal that stated that as a former volunteer I was finally freed from any Groupement, I was now a completely free man, even if only a factory worker, but after all the suffering very satisfied with that, I was as I said a free man.

00:33:41.454 --> 00:33:42.180
David Boder: And then?

00:33:42.180 --> 00:34:03.706
Karl Josephy: We regularly received news from our child, the child was thriving and well taken care of, only because of the war effects – because you cannot forget that my wife had the child after time in a terrible camp in which she was interned – that is to say that the child was very weak and that were lucky ...

00:34:03.706 --> 00:34:04.099
David Boder: Now say ...

00:34:04.099 --> 00:34:05.521
Karl Josephy: ... that the child was alive.

00:34:05.521 --> 00:34:10.535
David Boder: Wait, you are saying that your wife had the child AFTER a camp internment?

00:34:10.535 --> 00:34:33.936
Karl Josephy: After a camp, right, because my wife was a Belgian refugee. And like most Belgian refugees she was brought into a concentration camp which by itself was not as bad as the deportation camps, but still the hygiene was miserable. So during her pregnancy my poor wife had to ...

00:34:33.936 --> 00:34:34.964
David Boder: Wait ...

00:34:34.964 --> 00:34:35.267
Karl Josephy: Yes ...

00:34:35.267 --> 00:34:36.622
David Boder: Was that your child?

00:34:36.622 --> 00:34:37.493
Karl Josephy: Yes. Of course.

00:34:37.493 --> 00:34:41.267
David Boder: Well, how did your wife come to Belgium then during her pregnancy?

00:34:41.267 --> 00:34:48.700
Karl Josephy: I did not know my wife at that time. My wife told me she emigrated to Belgium from Austria, fled also ...

00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:48.973
David Boder: Yes ...

00:34:48.973 --> 00:34:50.939
Karl Josephy: ... from Belgium to France ...

00:34:50.939 --> 00:34:53.504
David Boder: ...yes, but she was not pregnant in Belgium?

00:34:53.504 --> 00:34:54.587
Karl Josephy: No, no, no, no....

00:34:54.587 --> 00:34:55.609
David Boder: ... now well, that was ...

00:34:55.609 --> 00:35:00.266
Karl Josephy: No, I want, I only want to mention this, that the child was very weak ...

00:35:00.266 --> 00:35:00.569
David Boder: Yes ...

00:35:00.569 --> 00:35:03.769
Karl Josephy: ... because my wife had, was in a camp during that time ...

00:35:03.769 --> 00:35:03.914
David Boder: Yes ...

00:35:03.914 --> 00:35:09.993
Karl Josephy: So the bad - was dependent on the bad food, had to lay on the naked floor, you know...

00:35:09.993 --> 00:35:10.199
David Boder: Yes ...

00:35:10.199 --> 00:35:12.522
Karl Josephy: ... it was snowing, so under catastrophic circumstances ...

00:35:12.522 --> 00:35:16.296
David Boder: ...yes, and not quite ready to become a mother.

00:35:16.296 --> 00:35:17.869
Karl Josephy: ... yes, very true, you know, and also one had ...

00:35:17.869 --> 00:35:19.950
David Boder: ...yes, well, and where is the child now?

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:22.273
Karl Josephy: The child is now with us – I have ...

00:35:22.273 --> 00:35:23.930
David Boder: You live in Paris already...

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:26.833
Karl Josephy: I live in Paris now, I returned to Paris ...

00:35:26.833 --> 00:35:27.348
David Boder: Yes ...

00:35:27.348 --> 00:35:31.243
Karl Josephy: After we still had to go through a lot in the time before ...

00:35:31.243 --> 00:35:31.546
David Boder: Oh ...

00:35:31.546 --> 00:35:36.288
Karl Josephy: After I was once arrested by a patrol, by a German patrol ...

00:35:36.288 --> 00:35:37.068
David Boder: Yes ...

00:35:37.068 --> 00:35:58.419
Karl Josephy: And, thank God, was released. After we still had to spend many nights in the woods, and after we had to constantly change our residence in the last couple of months before the liberation, in order to avoid the military that was on our track, so that we were finally able to reach the date of liberation.

00:35:58.419 --> 00:36:00.596
David Boder: Now wait, that is not clear to me...

00:36:00.596 --> 00:36:00.832
Karl Josephy: Yes?

00:36:00.832 --> 00:36:04.939
David Boder: Your wife was freed from the camp ...

00:36:04.939 --> 00:36:05.508
Karl Josephy: On the 16th ...

00:36:05.508 --> 00:36:07.377
David Boder: ...while you were still working for ...

00:36:07.377 --> 00:36:10.183
Karl Josephy: While I was still working in the woods, was working in the forest ...

00:36:10.183 --> 00:36:11.333
David Boder: ... in the forest.

00:36:11.333 --> 00:36:13.625
Karl Josephy: Yes, my wife was released.

00:36:13.625 --> 00:36:14.593
David Boder: ... and she could come to you?

00:36:14.593 --> 00:36:18.918
Karl Josephy: ... my wife come to you [sic, he means ‘me’], and she was completely free.

00:36:18.918 --> 00:36:21.120
David Boder: Yes, and then?

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:26.799
Karl Josephy: I then went with my wife to the little town where the wood factory was located ...

00:36:26.799 --> 00:36:27.767
David Boder: Yes ...

00:36:27.767 --> 00:36:37.475
Karl Josephy: And, ah, we stayed there, you know, until, ah, April ’45, so a little after the liberation. That is ...

00:36:37.475 --> 00:36:37.923
David Boder: Yes ...

00:36:37.923 --> 00:36:38.673
Karl Josephy: We were...

00:36:38.673 --> 00:36:43.481
David Boder: And then, so when were you stopped by a German patrol, you said?

00:36:43.481 --> 00:36:48.804
Karl Josephy: Yes, that is an interesting story, I was in the neighboring township to buy meat ...

00:36:48.804 --> 00:36:49.379
David Boder: Yes ...

00:36:49.379 --> 00:37:00.169
Karl Josephy: And in the moment where I left the butcher shop a German patrol came on trucks, you know, put a machine gun to my head ...

00:37:00.169 --> 00:37:00.375
David Boder: Yes ...

00:37:00.375 --> 00:37:08.692
Karl Josephy: You know, and, ah, I was told to be quiet because there was a deployment against the resistance under way ...

00:37:08.692 --> 00:37:09.291
David Boder: Yes, and then?

00:37:09.291 --> 00:37:32.420
Karl Josephy: Of course I thought that I might never see my wife again, but thank God I had some false papers with me. Of course, that was an emergency measure. And after I spoke as little as possible, they actually took me for a French. From Lorraine, as the paper indicated ...

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:33.929
David Boder: You had false papers?

00:37:33.929 --> 00:37:34.444
Karl Josephy: I had false papers.

00:37:34.444 --> 00:37:35.956
David Boder: The work papers would not free you?

00:37:35.956 --> 00:37:36.379
Karl Josephy: Pardon?

00:37:36.379 --> 00:37:39.222
David Boder: The work papers would not have freed you?

00:37:39.222 --> 00:37:49.226
Karl Josephy: No, they would have arrested me immediately because on the work papers I was a man from Lorraine with a totally different name, born in Metz. So that saved my life.

00:37:49.226 --> 00:37:51.524
David Boder: Why, did, when did you get such a paper ...

00:37:51.524 --> 00:37:56.061
Karl Josephy: I got that from the Resistance, for whom I had worked, too.

00:37:56.061 --> 00:37:57.749
David Boder: So you worked for the Resistance.

00:37:57.749 --> 00:38:15.314
Karl Josephy: I rendered very little services, I came to it because the workers knew me very well and often asked me for translations because they knew that I spoke German, they fully trusted me, and I was very glad to do the translations for them.

00:38:15.314 --> 00:38:18.423
David Boder: Yes, what kind of, what translations would you do?

00:38:18.423 --> 00:38:23.921
Karl Josephy: Yes, that is easy to explain, those were army orders for the German army ...

00:38:23.921 --> 00:38:24.369
David Boder: Aha...

00:38:24.369 --> 00:38:30.653
Karl Josephy: You know, the, the Resistance wanted to know repeatedly where German troup units were located ...

00:38:30.653 --> 00:38:31.077
David Boder: Aha ...

00:38:31.077 --> 00:38:40.023
Karl Josephy: So that they could operate, and this way I had contact with the Resistance, who at my request immediately issued me a false paper.
