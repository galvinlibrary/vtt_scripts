Boder, English Translation","<p>Although large numbers of Jews lived in the Polish district of Eastern Upper Silesia, the Holocaust there (except of course for Auschwitz itself) is comparatively unknown. It had been part of Germany before 1918, and the Nazis reincorporated it into the Reich in 1939. Its 100,000 Jews, spread over more than forty Jewish communities, were then placed under the administration of a single Central Jewish Council. The Germans appointed Moshe (or Monek) Merin to head it. An active Zionist before the war, Merin organized Jewish police units to enforce the occupiers’ demands, hoping to save at least a portion of his Jews by making them indispensable to the German war effort. Hence he maintained strict order and organized work in the ghettos, rounded up the unemployed for shipment to various camps, and violently suppressed all overt forms of Jewish resistance. Against this background, Abraham Kimmelmann sketches an unforgettable story of desperate Jewish measures to stay alive and avoid deportation to labor and extermination camps in 1942 and early 1943.<sup>1</sup> He also takes us inside the smaller slave labor camps in Eastern Upper Silesia and documents the transition from army to SS control.</p><p>Kimmelmann’s hometown was Dąbrowa Górnicza, a factory center near Katowice just east of the 1939 Polish-German border and about thirty-five miles north of Auschwitz. It was home to about 5,000 Jews. His Hasidic family sent him to a private heder, but his education was cut short by the German invasion. Too young at eleven to be included in the early deportations of Jews to slave labor in Germany, he soon learned the metal trade to help maintain his family and keep it from being sent away from their home together with other “unproductive” Jews. Ultimately he could not avoid being transported to Markstadt labor camp and then to Fünfteichen, both satellites of concentration camp Gross-Rosen, where Krupp was expanding its huge Bertha Works. During the last months of the war he was taken to the main camp for a short time and to Buchenwald, where he was liberated in April 1945.</p><p>Kimmelmann is haunted by treatment of Jews by their fellow Jews during the Holocaust. Whether as Jewish Council members, Jewish police in the ghetto, or as block seniors at Markstadt, Jews strike him as more vicious and corrupt than some Germans. He occasionally loses sight of the directing Nazi hand behind every action. But Abraham is also thoughtful about the temptations placed before these individuals, wondering what he himself would have done in their position and whether their actions, too, were only human. What is more, he subsequently witnessed the still worse conditions that prevailed in concentration camps where the SS ruled more directly and the prisoner administration was largely non-Jewish.</p><p>A the time of his interview in Geneva in August 1946 the eighteen-year-old Kimmelmann was enrolled in a training program for mechanics sponsored by the ORT.</p><p class=”footnote”>1.

Due to his pre-war prominence and despite his advanced age (he was in his seventies at the time of the Occupation), he found himself in peril especially after the German takeover of the Vichy-government-controlled zone of France (the so-called “free zone”) on November 11, 1942.

He and the remainder of Krakowski’s immediate family—his mother, brother and sister—perished in the Belzec extermination camp. Not long after the German occupation of Łódź, Krakowski, along with a number of young able bodied Jewish males, was deported and spent nearly all of the war years in German slave labor camps. He was transferred from one camp to another until his liberation by American troops on May 1, 1945.</p><p>As a slave laborer, he encountered cruel and trying conditions and endured great suffering. His survival is owed in part to the pressing German need for slave labor, especially as the war progressed. There was an ongoing conflict in the Nazi hierarchy between those who wanted to destroy all Jews and those who wanted to preserve some Jews for labor. Unfortunately the former most often prevailed. Nevertheless, Krakowski was among the minority who did survive despite the obsessive, lethal Nazi ideological imperative to destroy European Jewry.</p><p>After his liberation, Krakowski, like so many of his fellow Jews, returned to his birthplace to see if any of his family had survived.

In 1939, when the boy was twelve, Hitler arranged the transfer of that part of Transcarpathian Ukraine to Hungary. That transfer meant that instead of being deported with the majority of Slovakian Jews in 1942, Heisler, his mother, and two brothers were ghettoized and sent to Poland only after the Germans occupied Hungary two years later. Heisler recalls Germans taking these actions, but Hungarian officials were most likely the major participants in the whole procedure. They certainly made the decision to keep his father behind in one of Hungary’s notorious labor battalions for adult Jewish males. Adolph’s father was not among the few survivors of those units.</p><p>At Auschwitz Adolph and one of his brothers were separated from the rest of their family and sent to the Jawiszowice coal mine, which supplied the factories in Auschwitz. He spent eight months there. This and other coal mines in the region were infamous for their hellish conditions, but Heisler recalls Jawiszowice as being less unbearable than the camps he experienced later in Germany. He mentions that his block senior protected him, without providing many details. He was evacuated with the rest of the Auschwitz contingent in early January 1945. Taken on foot and by train to Buchenwald and then on to a satellite camp near Nordhausen, he fell ill and could not join the death march to escape the approaching American army. Miraculously, at the last minute the Germans supplied trucks to evacuate at least some of the sick to Buchenwald. His inclusion probably saved his life, since a very large proportion of those marched out of Ohrdruf did not have the strength to finish the journey, and those left behind at Ohrdruf were massacred by the SS. At Buchenwald Heisler unhesitatingly attached himself to the young people’s barracks which was liberated by the Americans a short time later. In his description of the events, he provides another variation on the story about the commandant’s tardy telephone call so dear to the memory of the survivors.</p><p>For reasons that can no longer be determined, Heisler volunteered little about his personal life either before or after the Holocaust, and Boder made no effort to draw him out on the subject during the interview in Geneva.</p>

Boder, Translation, Elliot Lefkovitz, Footnotes","<p>Boder’s interview with Anna Braun represents a departure from those with other survivors. Mrs. Braun was a Mennonite whose family was victimized by the Stalinist Soviet Union, especially during the 1930s. The Mennonites are a Protestant group whose members first began to settle in the Ukraine, where the Braun family resided, in the late 18th century. They believe their lives should be guided by Christ’s teachings in the Holy Bible and by the Holy Spirit. They call for a strict separation between church and state and advocate the extension of biblical teachings into social and economic life. In so doing, they reject military service and holding public office, strive for congregational and communal autonomy, and embrace an ethic of love and devotion to the Divine. These and other teachings were anathema to the atheistic, totalitarian Stalinist regime, which sought to inculcate the Soviet population with communist ideas and ideals. Therefore, the Mennonites communities living in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic underwent repression and persecution. Then, following the invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany on June 22, 1941, Mrs. Braun and her family endured the vicissitudes of a brutal war which cost millions of lives.</p><p>Mrs. Braun was born in 1906 in the Zaporozhye district of the Ukraine. Her native language was German, and Boder conducted the 1946 interview with her in this language. At the time of the interview, she was accompanied by her twenty year old stepdaughter and ten year old daughter. The original Braun family included Anna’s parents and her brother and two sisters. Her father owned a steam-powered flour mill in the town of Tartiza. During the 1918-1921 civil war following the 1917 communist revolution, Mrs. Braun’s father was killed. The 1930s brought difficult times to the Mennonites of the USSR, and by the mid 1930s all Mennonite churches had been closed by the regime. Mrs. Braun’s brother was arrested in 1935 for seeking permission to hold church services. He died in prison two years later. Her husband was arrested in 1936 on false charges. After six months of imprisonment, he was sentenced to death and never heard from again. In 1938, at the height of the Stalinist Great Terror during which some 800,000 people were executed, Mrs. Braun’s stepfather was arrested, imprisoned and was also never again heard from. Many other Mennonite families suffered similar losses, and the spiritual leadership of the Mennonite communities was decimated.</p><p>Mrs. Braun survived the Great Terror and, when Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, was working as a technical draftswoman. By the late summer of 1941, the Germans had captured the area of the Ukraine in which Mrs. Braun resided, and she and her family lived for two years under German rule. The Germans allowed the reopening of Mennonite churches, but Mrs. Braun was appalled by the genocidal policies of the Nazis towards Jews and deeply offended by the sacrilegious nature of the “Heil Hitler” salute.</p><p>As the Red army approached the Zaporozhye region, Mrs. Braun and her children were deported for forced labor in Germany in the fall of 1943. The Brauns arrived first in Lvov (now L’viv) in western Ukraine, and ended up in a camp in Neustadt located on the Baltic near the city of Danzig (now Gdansk). Mrs. Braun continued to work as a technical draftswoman and received some financial compensation for her labors. As the front approached in the winter of 1944-’45, she and her daughter and stepdaughter were again deported, this time to Czechoslovakia. After about four months, there was a final evacuation in the direction of Munich, but some sixty miles from there, the Brauns were liberated by American forces.</p><p>After first being interned in a displaced persons camp in Heilenbach, Bavaria, they finally made their way to the Funkkaserne displaced persons camp in Munich after receiving word that relatives of theirs were there along with several hundred other Mennonites. From this camp, they intended to immigrate to British Columbia in Canada where brothers of Mrs. Braun’s husband lived along with other Mennonites. The Brauns were much more fortunate than thousands of other Mennonites who were forcibly repatriated to the Soviet Union. Upon their return, many were arrested and exiled to Siberia.</p><p>Mrs. Braun’s story is a reminder of the strength and resilience displayed by Mennonite women in the predominantly female-led families of the group during and immediately after the war. It is also a reminder of the cruelty and suffering inflicted upon its people by the Stalinist Soviet Union, which, like its Nazi totalitarian counterpart, debased and destroyed countless millions of human beings. The Stalinist terroristic state transformed peaceful citizens into “enemies of the people,” perverted the judicial system and brought about untold numbers of family tragedies and losses such as those endured by Mrs. Braun.</p>",Elliot Lefkovitz

Boder, English Translation","<p>The Jews of eastern Poland were under Soviet rule for the first twenty-one months of the war and hence were spared Nazi persecution until Hitler turned eastward in June 1941. Anna Kaletska never made it clear where in Poland she and her husband lived before the war, although it is probable that it was in or near his parents’ hometown of Grodno in the northeast part of the country.<sup>1</sup> Evidently he was in the Polish army, and she was visiting her hometown of Kielce when the Germans attacked in 1939. Shortly after Poland surrendered, she made the 300-kilometer trip from Kielce to Grodno in the Soviet zone; such travel was still possible in the weeks immediately following the capitulation. In Grodno she was reunited with her husband, and there they experienced the second German onslaught in 1941.</p><p>Grodno sits on the ethnic border between Poland and Belorussia in an area of mixed languages and cultures. It had been part of Poland from 1919 to 1939 and then of the USSR until 1941, when the Germans annexed it to their province of East Prussia. At the beginning of November 1941 its 25,000 Jews were herded into two ghettos, one for able workers in the synagogue quarter and the other for “nonproductive” Jews in the suburb of Slobodka. Shortly after the birth of their daughter, Anna and her husband managed to slip from Slobodka to the central ghetto and then to escape deportation, but someone denounced them to the Germans as they attempted to reach the partisans in the forest. They were separated, and Anna never saw her husband again. After surviving slave labor at Auschwitz and in Germany, she learned the tragic fate of her only child.</p><p>Kaletska’s interview is striking for what it says about Gentile willingness to help Jews in Grodno and its surrounding area. A woman she scarcely knew took in her baby and raised it as her own. Complete strangers gave her and her husband shelter as they fled the city. And yet, various other Gentiles turned them over to the Germans and later identified her baby as Jewish. One could never know. Although Anna probably could have passed as a Pole once she escaped from the Grodno ghetto, and had Gentile friends to boot, ties to her family and her community brought her back even when she had grounds to fear the worst from the Germans. Once in German hands, she was virtually forced to take on an “Aryan” identity, and actually did so for a while. But this time despair and perhaps even the wish to die compelled her to reassert her Jewishness. The long-term prospects of “passing” successfully were not good, but in Anna’s case the will to try was all but absent.</p><p>At Auschwitz Anna had the supreme good fortune of being assigned to a block run by a Polish political prisoner, probably arrested for resistance activity, who knew how to please the SS while helping her charges. The woman probably saved Anna’s life. While Anna was in Auschwitz the famous Sonderkommando revolt of October 7,1944, occurred. Her vivid recollection of the rising is mistaken in several respects. Just one SS man was burned alive, and two more were killed in the ensuing struggle, along with 450 prisoners. Nor did any of the inmates escape. What is significant is the iconographic quality of Anna’s telling of the event. The very fact that Jews had at last turned on their tormentors took on dimensions in the minds of the victims that can scarcely be imagined today.</p><p>Kaletska was thirty-four years old when she was interviewed on the afternoon of September 26,1946, in the rehabilitated synagogue of Wiesbaden, Germany. Described by Boder as “a woman of fair complexion with naturally light hair,” it is understandable that she could, and for a time did, pass as a Gentile, although the idea was not always her own. During the interview she frequently fell into episodes of sobbing that obscured parts of her story. Boder observed: “These paroxysms were obviously nurtured by depressing memory associations, justifiable self-pity before a sympathetic listener, and a sense of ‘guilt’ at having survived. It might be said that Mrs. Kovitzka feels as if her own redemption from the fate which befell her near and dear ones and her concentration camp associates was a betrayal of the bonds of love and solidarity.”</p><p class=”footnote”>1.This interview appears in Boder’s <em>I Did Not Interview the Dead</em>, under her real name, Anna Kovitzka.</p>",From FRESH WOUNDS: EARLY NARRATIVES OF HOLOCAUST SURVIVAL by Donald L.

Kasztner was a Hungarian journalist, lawyer and Zionist leader who in early 1943 became a key figure in the Zionist movement’s Relief and Rescue and Committee of Budapest headed by Otto Komoly. The committee engaged in relief efforts and in smuggling Jewish refugees from Poland and Slovakia into Hungary. Hungary was originally an ally of Nazi Germany but until March 19, 1944 (when it was occupied by the Germans) its Jewish community was untouched by the Nazi’s “Final Solution.” Until the occupation, though burdened by several anti-Jewish measures, the Breslauers and other Hungarian Jews could live a fairly normal existence.</p><p>Following the German occupation, Kasztner and leading fellow Zionists such as Joel Brand felt that most fruitful avenue for Jewish rescue lay in direct negotiations with the enemy. Brand was sent by the Germans to Istanbul in neutral Turkey to establish contact with Jewish leaders abroad and secure their support for a plan to release large numbers of Jews from German-occupied territories in return for trucks and other materials that would be given to war-ravaged Germany—the so-called “Blood for Goods” proposal. The goods would be shipped to Germany from neutral countries, and international Jewish bodies would play a role in financing the agreement. However, the “Blood for Goods” deal never came to fruition due to opposition by the Allied governments.</p><p>Kasztner’s rescue negotiations were aided by the willingness of Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, to make a concessionary gesture in view of Germany’s deteriorating war situation. The result was the selection of 1,686 Jews for the transport described by Breslauer. Among the Jews on the Kasztner transport were Kasztner’s family and friends, wealthy people (such as the Breslauers) who helped to finance the operation and others such as Joel Teitelbaum, the ultra-Orthodox Satmer Rebbe. They were first interned in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, but Kasztner’s unceasing efforts to arrange financing by international Jewish organizations led to the Germans’ transfer of the internees to neutral Switzerland. The first group of 318, of which Breslauer and his family were a part, left Bergen-Belsen for Switzerland on August 18, 1944. The second group of 1,368 left for Switzerland on December 6, 1944.</p><p>After the war, Kasztner was accused by some of traitorous dealings with the enemy, saving his own family and friends at the expense of others, favoring wealthy Jews at the expense of ordinary Jews, and not doing enough to warn Hungarian Jewry about Nazi genocide. His defenders countered that given conditions at the time in Hungary, negotiations with the Nazis were the only way to save Jews, Kasztner’s efforts to save his family and friends were only natural, the financing by wealthy Jews was crucial for the success of the rescue effort which also saved less wealthy Jews, and that Kasztner’s committee had tried to warn Hungarian Jews about the Holocaust, but most Hungarian Jews did not take the information seriously because it was “beyond belief.” Kasztner settled in Israel after the war, but accusations against him led to a trial resulting in a judgment that he had “sold his soul to Satan.” The Israel Supreme Court overturned the judgment against Kasztner, but on March 3, 1957, he was shot on the street in Tel Aviv by nationalist extremists and died nine days later. He continues to be the subject of controversy.</p><p>Breslauer’s story illustrates that those saved by the Kasztner transport still had to endure suffering and loss and the challenge of rebuilding their shattered lives after the war. The beloved elder daughter of the Breslauers died of pneumonia in Bergen-Belsen. After the war, though in later middle age, Breslauer, who had worked for 35 years as a stock broker leading a comfortable upper middle class existence, was being trained in embroidery. His wife, who had been a high school mathematics instructor, was also learning a new trade.

Boder, English Translation","<p>Zionist fundamentalism inspired suspicions of non-Jews that complicated Jewish-Gentile relations in normal times but served Jews well during the Holocaust. Baruch Friedman’s Zionist convictions caused him to disbelieve official stories about relocating the Slovakian Jews in 1942 and instead to flee to the forest with his younger brother. Their parents, merchants and farmers in Kurima, either believed Slovakian and German lies or acquiesced in their fate, as did most Slovakian Jews. The brothers hid with the aid of a Gentile acquaintance and, after the deportations stopped, reported voluntarily to one of several work camps for Jews set up by the Slovaks. It turned out to be agreeable as such camps went in those years, but the brothers’ suspicions were hardly allayed. They made contact with anti-German partisans in the forests and armed themselves against a renewal of anti-Jewish measures. </p><p>These preparations paid off during the Slovak National Uprising against the Tiso regime, August 28 to October 27,1944. Friedman and his brother were freed along with the other Jewish inmates of work camps. Although they helped fight German and Slovakian forces in the liberated zone, and Friedman’s brother died in combat, Friedman himself was deeply ambivalent about both the uprising’s prospects of success and the attitudes toward Jews of even anti-Nazi Slovaks. Following the suppression of the uprising, he again took to the forest, this time with a sizable band of partisans made up of Jews and Gentiles. In February 1945 they broke through to the Russian side. He then returned to his village only to find his family gone, their home looted, and the fields taken over by neighbors. All this confirmed him in his determination to leave for Palestine. Boder found him living at Tradate, the home in northern Italy for young displaced Jews who had formed a kibbutz. (Boder noted the Friedman had a number of aliases, including “Abram Perl,” which he used at the time of, but not during, the interview.)</p>

Boder, English Translation","<p>Boder experimented in some of the interviews by focusing on special episodes rather than trying to tell the subject’s whole story. Benjamin Piskorz’s membership in the Jewish Fighting Organization that revolted against the Germans in the Warsaw ghetto made it natural to begin there, although it was done at the expense of background information. We know only that he was a native of Warsaw, had studied German in high school, and that his father had been deported in 1941 and never heard from again. Piskorz’s account of the ghetto uprising is brief but introduces several interesting elements, including the Germans’ use of Jewish turncoats to ferret out Jews in hiding in the ghetto ruins during the last day of the revolt. It also mentions the inspirational figure of a woman who died in the first battle of the uprising, who, whatever the facts about her may have been, evidently served the cause of ghetto martyrology. Captured and tortured by the Germans, Piskorz carried the marks of his own martyrdom plainly on his face. </p><p>Benjamin Piskorz was one of the few Jews sent to Treblinka to be selected there for work elsewhere. He was sent to Majdanek and then to the Buna works at Monowitz (Auschwitz III). There he was taken under the wing of the camp’s orchestra conductor and given the privileged job of cleaning the musicians’ block. Piskorz recalls spending two years there, but it could not have been more than eighteen months. He was evacuated on foot and by train to Dora-Mittelbau, a subcamp of Buchenwald, from which he escaped during a bombing raid. During the last chaotic months of Hitler’s Reich Piskorz succeeded in disguising himself as a wounded SS man with a medical discharge and ended up as overseer on a farm in the Sudetenland. Luckily, the Soviet officer who came to shoot him as a captured war criminal was Jewish and allowed himself to be convinced of Piskorz’s true identity.</p><p>Benjamin Piskorz faces up to one of the neglected aspects of the survivors’ experiences, namely the rage and drive for revenge felt by some of them. He admits to committing atrocities against German civilians after his liberation, and his description of returning to Auschwitz to torment his old tormentors provides rare evidence that the Russians put captured SS men to work at the scene of their crimes. After a close call with the law in British-occupied Austria, Piskorz married, moved to Italy to prepare for emigration to Palestine, and at the time of his interview at Tradate DP camp had just become a father.</p>

Boder, English Translation","<p>Jewish men sent to Germany shortly after the conquest of Poland often did their slave labor in actual concentration camps. One of the most articulate accounts of survival at Buchenwald is provided by Bernard Warsager, a Polish Jew who spent five and one-half years in the German camp. The young artist, who had studied at the Warsaw Academy of Art, was drafted into the Polish army in 1939 at the age of twenty-three, only to have his unit surrounded by German forces in the early days of World War II. Warsager managed to escape and return to his home town of Tomaszów Mazowiecki, but not for long. There were many like him, and the Germans swept the newly occupied territories for young Poles to be sent to camps in Germany.</p><p>Buchenwald was probably the most efficiently organized and least brutal of the German concentration camps—the best of the worst, one might say—by the time Warsager arrived in October 1939. A major scandal the previous year involving corruption among the SS and the professional criminals that had constituted the camp elite had led to housecleaning and opportunities for the political prisoners to take control. Otherwise Warsager might not have lived to tell this story. (He seems to have perceived these changes most acutely in 1943, by which time an influx of foreign prisoners had changed the ethnic composition of the camp underground, but the crucial developments had occurred before his arrival at Buchenwald.) However, he is far from uncritical of the men with the red triangle who helped run Buchenwald, finding some as brutal and venal as the “greens.” Equally surprising is his account of library resources and informal classes that made it possible for Buchenwald inmates to pursue intellectual interests, psychology in Warsager’s case. More conventional is his description of work conditions in the camp that drove some prisoners to take their own lives—”murdered by suicide” in Warsager’s trenchant phrase. He attributes his own drive to go on to his faith in the future of Zionism. </p><p>Warsager and thousands of other prisoners from Poland were initially accommodated in a temporary “small camp” improvised with tents and barbed wire fences on the edge of Buchenwald’s roll call square. Food and hygiene were far worse than in the main camp, and work in the stone quarry was even more brutal than usual. Prisoners who did not deliberately run through the sentry line to be “shot while trying to escape” almost inevitably fell sick with dysentery, but frostbite got Bernard sent to the infirmary for a second time. We may speculate that one reason he emerged alive, and with a successful throat operation thrown in for good measure, was SS admiration of sketches he made there. At the same time we should not lose sight of the proficiency of prisoner doctors who worked under anything but ideal conditions. Warsager may also have been one of the camp’s skilled workers, for in most cases only they were exempted from the transfer of all Jews from German concentration camps to Poland in October 1942.</p><p>Bernard tried in vain to evade evacuation from Buchenwald during the last days of the war. He escaped from a death march, hid from the SS, and was liberated by American forces just when he thought he had reached the limits of his endurance. Following an abortive effort to pick up the pieces of his life in Poland, he led a group of fellow survivors through the British occupation zone of Germany, hoping to reach Palestine by way of Holland. Arrested at the border, they were subjected to what Warsager considered a renewal of the concentration camp experience. After three months he was released, moved to Italy, and joined a kibbutz housed in a castle at Tradate, halfway between Milan and Como, where he was interviewed. There he prepared for a new life in Palestine.</p>

Boder, English Translation, Elliot Lefkovitz, Footnotes","<p>Bertha Goldwasser was born in Poland and came to Paris, France in 1936 at about the age of twenty-four to study engineering. There she met and married her husband, Kuba Goldwasser. The couple was part of the some 200,000 French Jews who lived in Paris on the eve of World War II. The majority of these were eastern European Jews, who like Mrs. Goldwasser had immigrated to France after World War I. They contributed to the vibrant Yiddish cultural and political life of the city.  In the wake of France’s disastrous defeat by Nazi Germany in June 1940, the collaborationist Vichy government came to power. In October of that year, it passed a series of anti-Jewish measures which impacted Jews in the northern German occupied zone of France, which included Paris, as well as the unoccupied so-called Vichy “free zone” in the southern portion of the country. Bureaucratic machinery was established to impose these anti-Semitic measures on some 330,000 French Jews.</p><p>The Goldwassers has an infant daughter at the time of Kuba’s arrest in 1941. He was deported in 1942, and eventually became one of the 77,000 French Jews killed by disease, starvation and exhaustion in French internment camps, executed in French prisons or murdered in deportation, mainly to Auschwitz. The Vichy regime was complicit in all these deaths.</p><p>Bertha Goldwasser and her baby daughter were arrested in the notorious round-up of the Jews of Paris on July 16-17, 1942. They were ultimately interned in the Drancy detention camp located in a suburb of Paris, and from there deported to Auschitz. By prying loose planks from the floor of the railroad car on the train carrying her and her daughter to Auschwitz, Mrs. Goldwasser managed to escape, but in the fall from the train the baby was killed. She found shelter with a family of French resisters and, following her recuperation, joined the resistance herself. She was involved in some daring exploits, such as smuggling downed Allied fliers to safety in neutral Spain.</p><p>Mrs. Goldwasser also fought in the August 1944 battle to liberate Paris and was wounded in this struggle. Following the war, she established contact with two aunts in the United States. They invited both her and her brother, who had survived the war as a soldier in the Red Army and was in a Displaced Persons camp near Munich, to come to America.</p><p>At the time of the interview, Mrs. Goldwasser was working for the Neue Freie Presse, a Jewish leftist newspaper. This interview aptly illustrates the remarkable bravery and courage displayed by many Jewish French women during the Holocaust.</p>",Elliot Lefkovitz

Like other interviewees who used pseudonyms or refused to give their full names, Boguslaw was reluctant to reveal his identity to Boder, and his surname is never mentioned. At the time, the practice of giving recorded statements was still a new concept, and many interviewees—especially those who had plans to emigrate to Palestine—were wary of Boder’s motives, not to mention possible repercussions (real or imagined) should their testimony be heard by the wrong ears.</p><p>Boguslaw was active in the Polish Resistance movement during the German occupation of Poland, which began in 1939. He also claims to have helped in organizing the ill-fated Warsaw Ghetto Uprising which took place in April 1943, although he was arrested by the Gestapo and taken to the infamous Pawiak prison just before heavy fighting began. His arrest and subsequent deportation to the Gross-Rosen concentration camp may have saved his life—the German response to the Uprising was unmerciful. Approximately 13,000 Jews were killed during the battle, and many of the remaining 50,000 residents were sent to the Treblinka extermination camp. After the deportations, the Germans razed the ghetto to the ground.</p><p>Though he does not mention it to Boder, Boguslaw may have been moved to another camp during the war—he claims to have been liberated by “Anglo-American” troops, but Gross-Rosen was in fact liberated by Soviet forces on February 14, 1945. At the time of the interview, he was studying music at the UNRRA University at the Deutsches Museum in Munich. No discussion of his future plans is included.</p><p>It is unclear why Boder did not choose to transcribe this interview as part of his efforts during the late 1940s and early 50s—the short duration of the interview (less than 15 minutes) may have been a factor. Unfortunately, the only existing copy of the recording is marred by static and uneven volume levels, so a full transcription could not be made. Still, it provides a noteworthy glimpse into Polish life under the German occupation, and the efforts of the Jewish population to resist their fate.</p>",Eben E. English

Mr. Czolopicki was deported to Germany along with thousands of other Poles after the failed Polish uprising against the Germans in the summer and early fall of 1944. Sent to the Rhineland under inhuman conditions, he was a forced laborer until he was liberated by American troops in March, 1945. He then came to Paris working for the Americans in an unstated capacity. At the time of the interview, he was studying radio with the hope of one day immigrating to the United States.

Hirsch was born in Mannheim, Germany. In 1937, his parents left him with his grandparents and emigrated to Buenos Aires, planning to send for their son. The war intervened, and in 1940 David and his grandparents were deported to Gurs, an internment camp in newly conquered France. From there, in the spring of 1941, they were sent to Rivesaltes, another internment camp in France.</p><p>David fortunately was taken from Rivesaltes by the Œuvre de secours aux enfants (OSE), a French Jewish organization.

It appears that the interview was conducted in German and then in Spanish. Due to language problems, Mr. Lea had some difficulty communicating his responses to Boder’s questions so parts of the interview are a bit hard to interpret. The language barrier may also account for some inconsistencies in Mr. Lea’s account, but these may also be due to the terrible traumas he experienced.

In this capacity, he witnessed the destruction of several hundred thousand Hungarian Jews in the late spring and early summer of 1944. Mr. Lea was in the sickbay in Auschwitz during the memorable October 7, 1944 revolt of the Sonderkommando in which Greek Jews played a vital role.

The Italians resisted German demands to deal harshly with the Jews.</p><p>In Athens, Mrs. Button stayed first with her sister and then with her husband’s relatives. He joined her in the city. Her brother and elderly mother were there as well. Mrs. Button attempted successfully to reinstate the Spanish citizenship she had held as a child. This would prove a life saving measure. On September 8, 1943, the Germans occupied Athens following the surrender of Italy to the Allies. Mrs. Button and other Athenian Jews went into hiding when the Germans ordered all Jews in Athens to register with the community. She and others lived in constant fear.</p><p>Mrs. Button’s husband was able to successfully escape by boat to neutral Turkey and from there to Palestine. On April 12, 1944, Mrs. Button, her brother and mother along with other Jews with Spanish citizenship were deported to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp rather than to Auschwitz-Birkenau where they would have faced almost certain death. They were interned in the so-called neutral camp in Bergen-Belsen from which Mrs. Button was liberated by the British army on April 15, 1945. Once freed, Mrs. Button went to Paris where, fifteen days before the interview with Boder, she was reunited with her child. At the time of the interview, Mrs. Button was preparing to join her husband in Tel Aviv.</p><p>Mrs. Button’s interview vividly demonstrates how the Holocaust ripped families asunder. This is illustrated by Mrs. Button’s heartbreaking separation from her baby daughter and then from her husband. The interview ends on a positive note with the promise of family reunification. Many families were not nearly as fortunate.</p>",Elliot Lefkovitz

Boder, English Translation","<p>Lithuanian Jewry, like its counterpart in eastern Poland, encountered the Germans for the first time in June 1941. The principal difference was that Lithuanian nationalists, embittered by Soviet rule in 1940 and 1941, viewed the Germans as a lesser evil and the Jews as supportive of Communism. Ephraim Gutman had been born in 1917 in Ukraine, but he lived most of his life up to 1944 in the Lithuanian capital of Kaunas (which he calls by its Russian name, Kovno). He experienced the birth, life, and death of the Kovno ghetto. On the day of his interview at Hénonville Displaced Persons Home near Paris in September 1946 he was one of only about 2,000 survivors of a Jewish community that had numbered 40,000 before the war.</p><p>This interview documents poor relations between Lithuanians and Jews in 1941. Although Lithuanian contempt for the Jews is well known, Gutman’s sentiments suggest that it was heartily reciprocated by at least some Jews, who sneered at their neighbors as primitive “Lithuanian Klurnpes,” named for the peasants’ wooden shoes. Far more graphic, however, are his descriptions of Lithuanian nationalists lashing out at the Jews at the moment of German conquest. These extremists were exacting revenge for what they regarded as Jewish sympathy with the USSR during its brief occupation of their country. The Soviets had restricted Jewish religious and economic life but opened the doors to Jewish participation in higher education and politics, thereby attracting a following among young Jews. This association by Lithuanian nationalists of Jews with Communism had catastrophic consequences in the form of pogroms during the interval between the flight of the Red Army and the arrival of the Germans. Gutman and his family were spared only by the intervention of a sympathetic Lithuanian acquaintance. His recollections also show how the Germans subsequently were able to draw ordinary Lithuanians into measures against the Jews by permitting them to share booty taken from the victims. Lithuanian volunteers would continue to assist the Germans in actions against the Jews throughout the war, both in Kovno and elsewhere. </p><p>Gutman is most intent upon describing the initial acts of Nazi violence against the Jews in the first months of the Kovno ghetto, as well as the last, heartbreaking deportation of children and old people in March 1944. But he also shows how the Germans gradually whittled down the population of the ghetto to around 18,000 with executions and deportations. A close reading of his interview reveals that he and most others who survived in Kovno had, or were related to someone who had, a “Jordan card” attesting to the status of a skilled laborer working for the Germans in the ghetto. These were issued by SA captain Fritz Jordan, the superintendent of Jewish affairs in Kovno and from all accounts a thoroughly sinister figure. In September 1941 he delivered 5,000 of these “Certificates for Jewish Artisans” to the Jewish Council, led by Dr. Elchanan Elkes. Elkes and his fellow Jewish elders were divided over the wisdom of distributing the certificates, but they finally bowed to demands from the Jewish workers themselves, who hoped that possession of a “Jordan card” might enhance their chances of survival. Gutman, an electrician, had one of them. </p><p>Among the most interesting passages of his account are those regarding the involvement of at least a part of the Kovno ghetto’s Jewish police force in preparations for resistance and establishing bunkers in which Jews planned to hide from future deportations. Sadly, the Nazis succeeded in turning the lower ranks of the Jewish police against their officers, resulting in reprisals and the discovery of many bunkers. Nor did such hiding places save many Jews when the ghetto was liquidated in July 1944. Using dogs and grenades, the Germans flushed out and killed or deported virtually all the survivors. Fewer than one hundred Jews were still in Kovno when the Red Army returned at the beginning of August, following which Gutman recovered the hidden ghetto archives that he had helped to organize.</p><p>Gutman abruptly terminated the interview before describing the ghetto’s liquidation. Boder was perplexed. Was he called away by a legitimate emergency, or was he unable or unwilling to go on for some personal reason?</p>",From FRESH WOUNDS: EARLY NARRATIVES OF HOLOCAUST SURVIVAL by Donald L. Niewyk.

She had been born fourteen years before the German invasion in Wojsławice, a small community in the Bielsko district of southern Poland, southwest of Kraków. At some point during her childhood the family moved to the nearby city of Andrychów where they lived a solid, middle class existence. The Germans divided the family almost immediately, and as it turned out, irrevocably. In 1941 Fela was sent to slave labor in the first of several textile mills inside Germany, the last of which was part of Gräben, a satellite of Gross- Rosen concentration camp. She shows how conditions for her and her coworkers went from bad to worse as SS control became more nearly complete. She views herself as one who steadfastly retained her dignity through every ordeal, confounding some of her tormentors.</p><p>Evacuated westward to Bergen-Belsen at the beginning of 1945, Nichthauser experienced the rapid disintegration of conditions in this hideously overcrowded camp, packed with growing numbers of forced workers from all over Hitler’s collapsing empire. Anyone who reads her description of sanitary conditions there will understand why she found three months in Belsen far worse than the entire previous five years. There Fela experienced firsthand the sadism of the beautiful but mad Irma Grese, who had already established a reputation for brutality as an SS guard at Auschwitz. </p><p>Nichthauser was living near Paris and studying to become a dental technician at a school run by Jewish charities when she gave her interview in August 1946. Her parents and two brothers and two sisters died in the Holocaust; only she and a younger brother survived.

To contemplate how different her life might have been is to realize afresh the dimensions of the catastrophe that has befallen her.”</p>

Following the Russian Revolution and Civil War (1917-1921), she and her family immigrated first to Vienna, Austria and then, in 1926, to Paris. She eventually found employment with ORT, for whom she worked throughout the German occupation of France. As the Germans advanced on Paris in June 1940, she and her family fled to southern France, residing first in Vichy and then in Marseille. The area in which they lived came to be known as the “Free Zone” administered by the collaborationist Vichy government. Mrs. Monk, her mother and her foster son, a young Spaniard, eventually moved to the Italian zone of occupation in southeastern France near the city of Grenoble. When that zone was abolished, they lived under direct German occupation. All this time, Mrs. Monk worked for ORT, describing her coworkers as her “second family.”</p><p>Fira Monk’s interview details the dedicated and courageous work she and other ORT members were engaged in during the occupation, including issuing false papers, hiding Jewish children, and distributing financial aid to unemployed Jews or those in hiding. This work entailed great risks, to which her narrow escapes from deportation testify. Her endeavors on behalf of Jews in France and those of others in ORT underscore the sometimes-overlooked efforts by Jews to save other Jews during the Holocaust.</p><p>The interview also illustrates both positive and negative behavior on the part of the French population towards Jews, ranging from those who sheltered Jews to those who were part of the dreaded Milice (Vichy paramilitary forces) that persecuted them. Some of the French police Fira Monk encountered were helpful to Jews, while others aided in their arrest and deportation. Although she, her mother, grandmother and foster son survived despite the constant threat of arrest and deportation, her elderly aunt and uncle and another paralyzed aunt were deported and murdered in Auschwitz.</p><p>Following the August 1944 liberation, she worked in Toulouse in a reception center for returning deportees and prisoners of war. She recounted some of what she learned about their harrowing experiences. Among the most horrifying accounts were from refugees who had been sexually abused or subject to pseudoscientific medical experiments. When Boder interviewed Fira Monk in September 1946, she was in Paris working as an ORT social worker aiding survivors. This work recalls the important efforts ORT and other organizations took for the care and rehabilitation of survivors, including dealing with the plight of orphaned children, securing the return of seized property (especially residential property), and vocational training and placement.</p>",Elliot Lefkovitz

Born in Mistelbach in Lower Austria, Schlaefrig was an architectural engineer by profession and a former ministerial counselor in the Austrian Railroad Ministry. As a former member of the Habsburg imperial bureaucracy, he enjoyed a comfortable pension and the respect of his community. In retirement he divided his time between an old hobby studying the acoustical properties of wooden instruments and service to the Jewish community as head of a local B’nai B’rith chapter. Schlaefrig describes initial Austrian Nazi measures against him and his associates, which were part of an anti-Jewish program that greatly impressed officials from Germany proper. He and his wife were able to send their daughter to England as a domestic servant at that time, but they themselves were unable to find a place of refuge before the Nazis banned emigration in October 1941.</p><p>Friedrich Schlaefrig’s status as a former Habsburg civil servant and a leading figure in the Vienna Jewish community helped determine that he and his wife would be sent to the “old folks” ghetto at Theresienstadt in occupied Czechoslovakia. Initially placed in the fortress at the edge of town and then moved into Theresienstadt proper, they participated in plucky efforts to make the hideously overcrowded facilities capable of supporting at least some of the prisoners. While his wife worked as a nurse in the infirmary, Schlaefrig volunteered for the camp’s technical services, using his engineering skills to pipe clean water into the town. He is obviously proud of an achievement that doubtless saved thousands of lives.</p><p>Was Schlaefrig one of the privileged Jews who survived by exploiting their prominent positions and contacts with the camp’s Jewish leaders? He takes pains to distance himself from Jewish Council chairman Rabbi Benjamin Murmelstein and other camp notables, but Boder’s probing of this point implies that he entertained some doubts on the matter. Indeed, later in the interview Schlaefrig reveals that on more than one occasion he was able to get his name removed from lists of prisoners scheduled for deportation to Polish death camps. That happened even when members of the important construction detail were losing their previous immunity to deportation. Moreover, Schlaefrig and his wife enjoyed a “very lovely” private apartment that went with his administrative position in the technical services department during the last months of the ghetto. On the other hand, there is no direct evidence that he was corrupted by power. Otherwise it seems unlikely that he would have been entrusted with important postliberation tasks on behalf of his former fellow captives.</p><p>When interviewed at the Paris offices of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee in August 1946, Schlaefrig was awaiting a telephone call from Lisbon with information on his ship to South Africa. There he hoped to join his son, who had emigrated before the war.</p>

He was working in Budapest when the Germans marched in, and although he had false papers supplied to him by the Zionist underground, he limited their use to visiting his family in the provinces. Using them at all was risky, and instead of posing as a Gentile and chancing discovery, Kaldore gambled that joining one of the Jewish labor battalions would prevent his deportation. He lost.</p><p>Sent to Auschwitz, Kaldore spent most of his time there at the camp associated with the Buna works at Monowitz, at first digging fortifications for the German Army and then stringing cable in the Buna factory itself. He describes mingling of Gypsies and Jews at the time of his arrival at Birkenau that was not typical and invites further research. He also makes some useful distinctions between his treatment by Wehrmacht and SS men and between Jewish capos, Polish overseers, and professional criminals in the camp hierarchy. It is clear from his unusually lucid narrative that cleaning up for his block senior provided him with extra nourishment that enhanced his chances of living. Kaldore notes that the barracks were infested with fleas and bedbugs, but he credits the Germans with stringent and successful measures to eliminate lice. It was not typhus but an infected foot that landed him in the sick ward at the end of 1944. He must have sensed that the hospital was the safest place for him to be since he feigned slow recovery from an operation to assure a prolonged stay. That is where he was when the SS panicked during the evacuation of the camp and left the sick behind. He was one of only a handful of survivors of Monowitz/Auschwitz III who managed to be liberated by the Red Army in January 1945.</p><p>Returning with difficulty to his hometown after the war, the twenty-two-year-old survivor went to work for the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, aiding refugees who were in worse shape than he.

But wealth by no means assured escape from the Nazi net. Hadassah Marcus’s family was prominent in Warsaw’s gem and precious metals trades, which gave them skills and access to valuables that helped them avoid deportation until near the end of the Warsaw ghetto in 1943. But whatever remained of their wealth probably disappeared in the ransoming of Marcus’s husband from the SS torture squads. In hiding during the last days of the ghetto, she and her family were betrayed by other Jews, and she and a younger sister were sent to Majdanek, where they were assigned to the work crew building the crematorium. She was twenty-nine at the time. </p><p>After three months at Majdanek the sisters were moved to Auschwitz, arriving at a very “lucky moment” indeed; by summer 1943 the camp had temporarily run short of laborers, and the mass exterminations had been suspended. They managed to stay together and were assigned to the justly feared task of clearing aquatic vegetation from fish ponds near the camp. One of Marcus’s deepest impressions of Auschwitz was the gassing in 1944 of large numbers of children held at the family camp at Birkenau. Postwar research has confirmed her impression that they had been kept alive solely to deceive the Red Cross, which had been pressing for an opportunity to inspect Auschwitz. Once the Red Cross dropped its demands—perhaps satisfied with what the Germans showed its representatives at the model Theresienstadt ghetto, or else caving in to German resistance—the children and the adults who lived with them in the family camp were liquidated.</p><p>The sisters managed to stay together during the last months of the war as they were sent to Ravensbrück, the German concentration camp for women, and then to one of its satellite work camps northwest of Berlin. There they were liberated, twice, in a sense, first by the Americans and then by the Soviets. They returned to Poland and settled in Łódź where Hadassah organized a Zionist kibbutz for the orthodox Agudat Israel, which was then shedding its earlier opposition to Jewish nationalism. There she ran into revived Polish anti-Semitism and encountered opposition from the official Central Committee of the Jews in Poland, sponsored by the new Communist government and dedicated to persuading Jews to stay and (as they confidently hoped at the time) help build a new Poland free from racial strife.</p><p class=”footnote”>1.

Helen Tichauer’s skills as a commercial artist came in handy when the Germans were developing ways of identifying and numbering prisoners in the early days of Auschwitz II (Birkenau). This led to her appointment as a kind of unofficial draftsperson in the camp headquarters, which shielded her from selections and murderous work details to the very end of the camp.</p><p>Tichauer was a native of Bratislava, which in 1939 became the capital of Slovakia. Three years later, at the age of twenty-three, she was among the first Slovakian Jews deported to Auschwitz. (Jewish women from Slovakia, among the first women sent to Auschwitz and often fluent in German, were well represented among the Auschwitz office workers. Of the twenty-seven women included in Lore Shelley’s Secretaries of Death, fifteen arrived from Slovakia in 1942.) At first she lived in the original camp, Auschwitz I, while helping to construct the new facilities at nearby Birkenau. Then, in August 1942 she was transferred to the women’s camp there. Almost immediately she made herself indispensable to the SS by painting stripes and printing numbers on the prisoners’ clothing. Later, installed in the camp offices, she kept records of deaths and workforce allocations for the administration. This position gave her an overall view of the camp available to few of its prisoners. Who else, for example, could have arranged a personal visit to the “little white cottage,” a former farmhouse where the first gassings took place at Birkenau before the construction of four modern crematoria during the first half of 1943? Nor could she miss the boundless cynicism in the Nazi deception of Gypsies and Czech Jews in 1944, holding out false hopes of salvation to the very end. Although “Zippi” (as she became known in the camp and subsequently) was always conscious of being in hell, she took a certain pride in her efficiency and the recognition it won from her German bosses. Immersing oneself in work was one way of forgetting for a moment the flames just outside the door. </p><p>Evacuated to Ravensbrück and then to one of its many satellite camps in Mecklenberg, Tichauer slipped away from her guards during the last days of fighting and lay low, waiting for the Russians to liberate her. Upon her return to Bratislava, she found just one brother there. Everyone else in her family had perished. She might have stayed there—conditions for survivors in Bratislava were evidently quite different from those in rural areas—but for her decision to marry another survivor who planned to join relatives in South America. She and her new spouse lived at the DP camp at Feldafing, near Munich, where she was interviewed in September 1946.</p>

Boder, English Translation, Elliot Lefkovitz, Footnotes","<p>David Boder interviewed Helena Neufeld at an adult home for Jews in Paris on August 3, 1946. Mrs. Neufeld was survivor of the Warsaw ghetto, the notorious Pawiak prison of Warsaw and the infamous Bergen Belsen concentration camp in Germany. Like a number of other survivors, she owed her survival to determination, resourcefulness and luck. Her interview revealed that she possessed both pluck and luck in abundance. As a Polish Jew, Mrs. Neufeld endured six years of Nazi tyranny and brutality. Like so many other survivors, she lost her entire family but not her husband to whom she was married in the Warsaw ghetto. The interview does not reveal how her mother, sister and brother in law with whom she lived in the Warsaw ghetto died. She survived two deportation actions for the ghetto, finally escaping and finding shelter for a time in “Aryan” Warsaw in the winter of 1943. She was in hiding in “Aryan” Warsaw when she witnessed the battle of the Warsaw ghetto.  In the summer of 1943, she was captured and sent to Warsaw’s Pawiak prison from where she was deported the Bergen Belsen camp.  One intriguing question that is not answered is why Mrs. Neufeld and her husband were transferred to one of the satellite camps Bergen Belsen for Poles who possessed immigration papers from other countries and where they were not assigned to work details, which was one reason they were able to survive in Belsen for some twenty months. They were among those evacuated from Belsen in the wake of the advancing English army and were liberated by the Russians in eastern Germany. Mrs. Neufeld’s testimony bears witness to the fact that there were courageous non Jewish Poles in Warsaw who were willing to hide Polish Jews. It also conveys some of the horrendous conditions Jews experienced at Bergen Belsen, which is etched in memory as a site of indescribable human suffering.</p>",Elliot Lefkovitz

Boder, English Translation, Elliot Lefkovitz, Footnotes","<p>Henja Frydman was born in Pinsk, then part of Poland and now in Belarus, in 1924. She was one of six children, and had three brothers and two sisters. In 1931, she emigrated to Paris with her family. Like other eastern European Jews who emigrated to the French capital during the inter-war period, they were seeking better economic opportunities and to escape from anti-Semitism. Henja’s father worked in the clothing business, a vocation engaged in by many Jews at that time. Prior to the defeat of France by Nazi Germany in June, 1940, Henja was a student, especially interested in literature. The German occupation shattered her life and that of her family, as it did for so many other French Jews.</p><p>One of her brothers was arrested in the summer of 1941, interned in the Drancy detention camp and then deported to Auschwitz where he perished of typhus, a common killer. Henja herself joined the communist element of the French resistance and worked in its propaganda section. She had to live separately from her beloved parents and brother due to her clandestine work. The separation pained her deeply.</p><p>In 1943, Henja was arrested and sent to Drancy where she remained for three months; her interview provides information on conditions there. In June 1943, along with others from her resistance group, she was deported to Auschwitz. Her parents and brother were deported there four months later and perished. Henja recalled the tortuous train journey to Auschwitz and the harrowing, indescribable year she spent in the camp. Her account of her first day in this hell on earth is especially graphic and heart-rending. Henja’s survival in Auschwitz is due to her strong mental attitude which was bolstered by her ideological convictions, to the solidarity she maintained with her fellow female prisoners, to the friendship of the legendary Mala Zimetbaum, and to luck.</p><p>Since Henja was working as nurse in the so-called Auschwitz hospital, she was not evacuated in the death march of 58,000 Auschwitz prisoners on January 18, 1945, and was liberated by the Red Army on January 27, 1945 along with 7,500 other prisoners. She made her way back to Paris where she worked in an administrative capacity for a survivors’ organization. Though she had two sisters and a brother who were living in Palestine and a relative in the United States, she planned to remain in France. Boder interviewed Henja in a facility for displaced persons in Paris and recorded a lengthy, moving and illuminating interview.</p>",Elliot Lefkovitz

Hildegard Franz’s fate was sealed when her Christian husband died during the war. A little more than two months later she was sent to Theresienstadt.</p><p>Her family lost its retail shop in Nuremberg to the Nazis in 1934, following which her two sons emigrated to the United States. She says nothing about her husband and herself trying to get out, although it seems probable that the elderly couple, already in their sixties, saw little hope of starting over someplace else. Her husband’s failing health may also have slowed them down. Following his death in October 1943, Hildegard was deported to the “model ghetto” at Theresienstadt in the comparative luxury of a third-class passenger coach. She knows no good reason why she was spared subsequent transport to the killing fields of Poland. In the end her comment about being lucky is as good an explanation as any.</p><p>A particularly vivid memory of Theresienstadt was of SS attempts to intimidate Franz into renouncing her husband’s will, which evidently benefited his relatives. Had she agreed, the Nazis could have declared his estate Hildegard’s and then confiscated it upon her death.  That she was able to resist their pressure demonstrates that the SS was not prepared to go too far where the property rights of purely German relatives were concerned. The facade of law and order had to be upheld.</p><p>Franz returned to her bombed-out apartment after the war to find its remaining contents looted by the couple, also intermarried, who had subletted from her. However, other property that she had left for safekeeping with a Christian friend was safely returned to her. Boder commented that he found many cases of Jews slated for deportation entrusting their valuables to Gentile friends and retrieving them satisfactorily after the war, especially in Czechoslovakia and Western Europe.</p><p>When interviewed at her temporary home in the Munich “Funkenkasernen” DP camp in September 1946, Franz had regained the weight she lost at Theresienstadt and looked younger than her seventy-five years. She was just days away from departure for Bremen and the sea voyage that would take her to live with her sons in America.</p>",From FRESH WOUNDS: EARLY NARRATIVES OF HOLOCAUST SURVIVAL by Donald L.

Isaac Wolf, who managed to elude the Germans, doubtless articulates the feelings of many of his fellow DPs who were not so fortunate. In the immediate aftermath of events, it was easy for them to forget that the rest of Europe was bleeding, too.</p><p>Wolf, twenty-three years old at war’s start and a Zionist in L’viv (he calls it by its German name, Lemberg), was drafted into the Polish army and slightly wounded in fighting with the Germans in 1939. The Russians were awarded his hometown a short time later and taught him to be a railroad mechanic; Isaac fled with them when the Germans attacked in 1941. After a close call or two, he managed to reach safety and avenged his fellow Jews by volunteering to fight in the Red Army. By 1945 he was a decorated veteran of numerous battles, including Stalingrad and the liberation of his hometown, Lemberg.</p><p>Isaac sensed that there was no future for him in Poland—he had lost everyone in the Holocaust—and decided to travel west on his way to Palestine. He spent almost a year after the end of hostilities in various DP camps in southern Austria, the British zone of occupation, and he leaves no doubt about his impression that the English were much less sympathetic to the Jews than were the Americans. His interview documents the impatience of the would-be emigrants with restrictions on their activities. It also highlights tensions with the Austrians, whom the refugees found hard to distinguish from Germans, and with Ukrainians, who were suspected of crimes against the Jews. Crossing illegally into the American occupation zone and then making their way to Italy, Isaac and a band of followers (including his pregnant wife) found no satisfactory refuge until they reached the camp at Castle Tradate, between Milan and Como, where members of several kibbutzim enjoyed self-government under the general sponsorship of the UNRRA. As a member of the camp’s elected governing committee, Wolf was well situated to comment on the situation there. His position gave him, his wife, and their new baby the luxury of a single private room. One can imagine life there for the average displaced person.</p>

Boder, English Translation","<p>The events narrated in this interview offer a glimpse of life in the large urban ghettos of Poland. Had Israel Unikowsky been a bit younger, he probably would not have survived. His initiative and native intelligence helped, but without the ability to work in ghetto and camp his chances were slim. He was just eleven when the Germans overran his hometown of Kalisz in western Poland. His mother had died when he was three, and his father had abandoned him and an older brother four years later. Raised in a religious orphanage for Jewish boys aged five to thirteen, the two brothers and thirty other orphans fled from the Germans toward what they hoped would be the comparative safety of the nearest big Polish city, Łódź. They made it shortly after the Germans took Łódź on September 8, 1939, and threw themselves on the mercy of the local Jewish community. Unikowsky would manage to stay there until the end of the ghetto almost five years later.</p><p>The morally ambiguous figure of ghetto leader Chaim Rumkowski presents itself almost at the beginning of Israel Unikowsky’s tale. Rumkowski, who headed the Łódź Jewish orphanages at the time of Poland’s downfall, at first seemed to despair of aiding his additional charges but later saw to their needs. One can hardly blame Unikowsky for hating the man who later tried to deport him and the rest of the ghetto children to death camps, but even Unikowsky acknowledges Rumkowski’s goal of saving at least some of the Jews through work and supplying them with rations that were fairly and efficiently distributed. This interview also introduces us to the far more shadowy figure of David Gertler, head of the ghetto police and second most powerful Jewish administrator in Łódź.</p><p>Unikowsky clearly shared the opinion of many ghetto inhabitants that Gertler was a more attractive figure than Rumkowski for his smuggling of food into and people out of the ghetto. Unikowsky does not mention that none of this could have been done without the connivance of corrupt German officials and that it led to Gertler’s arrest and deportation in July 1943. Evidently Gertler survived the war. The precise nature of his role in Łódź and his subsequent fate have never been fully clarified. </p><p>Unikowsky’s narrow escape from the massive deportations from Łódź in September 1942 is one of the more remarkable episodes in this collection. However, he could not evade being rounded up during the liquidation of the ghetto in 1944. He was sent to Auschwitz where he was healthy enough and lucky enough to be selected for work on a nearby farm that produced food for the camp. His luck held at Buchenwald, too. Sent there in January 1945, he was among those assigned to the youth block, most of whom survived. His account shows that at least some liberated concentration camp inmates subjected German civilians to revenge attacks before leaving the country. Unikowsky moved to France where he was studying dental technology at the time of his interview at the ORT home at Chateau de Boucicaut. He expressed no particular plans for the future, however. For him the lesson of the Holocaust was that “thinking about tomorrow won’t do.”</p>

He, along with his wife and two children, survived the Holocaust due to their Spanish citizenship. Spain was neutral during World War II and was able to afford some diplomatic protection to those Spanish Jews with Spanish citizenship who lived under German rule even though they had not lived in Spain. Boder’s interview with Mr. Button was conducted in German in a refugee residence in Paris. At the time of the interview, Mr. Button and his family were hoping to immigrate to Palestine. The interview was conducted in German.</p><p>Jacob Button and his family made an abortive attempt to escape from German occupied Salonika by boat to Athens when deportations of Jews began in March, 1943. Athens  was under the benevolent rule of Fascist Italy who at the time was allied with Nazi Germany. A second attempt to escape to Athens by train succeeded for Mr. Button’s wife and children. However, he was arrested, brutally interrogated and incarcerated for four months. He was freed with the help of the Spanish government. Mr. Button reached Athens in the summer of 1943 just before Italy surrendered to the Allies in September 1943, and the Germans occupied the city.</p><p>Approximately seven months later, Mr. Button and his family were sent to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp and interned in the so-called neutral camp for prisoners who were citizens of neutral countries. Although these internees were treated better than other prisoners, food rations diminished during the last month’s of the camp’s existence as more and more prisoners were shipped to Bergen-Belsen from camps in the east in the wake of the Red army’s offensive. Mr. Button recounted the cruelty and brutality he witnessed in the treatment of the general prison population in Bergen-Belsen. The camp was liberated by British troops on April 15, 1945.</p><p>Mr. Button’s interview attests to the efforts by some Spanish diplomats to call upon the Germans to respect Spanish sovereignty by exempting Jews with Spanish citizenship from persecution. The Spanish embassy in Greece interceded to secure Mr. Button’s release from prison. Spanish diplomats also sought to protect their nationals after the German takeover of Athens. However, the promises by the Germans that the Button’s would be sent to Spain proved hollow due to the reluctance of the Spanish government headed by Francisco Franco to allow Jews into the country. This policy resulted in the loss of Jewish lives.</p>",Elliot Lefkovitz

Boder, English Translation","<p>Jacob Minski was born in 1907 in Zurich, Switzerland, to Polish Jewish parents. He was raised in an orphanage in Hamburg and always carried a stateless passport, which would make it difficult for him to emigrate once the Nazis came to power. Arrested at the time of the Kristallnacht (literally, “Crystal Night,” also known as the “Night of Broken Glass”) pogroms, he spent ten weeks in the camp he calls Oranienburg, the original name of the concentration camp better known as Sachsenhausen.</p><p>Minski’s story jumps rather abruptly to October 1941 when he was deported to the Łódź ghetto. He remained there for nearly three years, becoming a member of the ghetto fire brigade that was so important to German authorities worried that a blaze in the dilapidated wooden ghetto structures might spread to the rest of the city. Boder drew Minski out on the barter economy and social life of the ghetto. Equally interesting is Minsk’s account of his deportation with other Jews from Łódź to Birkenau (Auschwitz II) in August 1944. His description of a prisoner saving a mother’s life by forcing her to give up her child during the initial selection suggests a degree of risk-taking and of prisoner control that is not always well understood. Likewise, his account of newly arrived Łódź Jewish police being targeted for death by the veteran inmates of Auschwitz demonstrates the existence of a rough and effective system of justice within the camp. The corruption of the block seniors at Auschwitz gets further confirmation in Minski’s description of his living conditions there.</p><p>Minski was one of the lucky ones transferred to work in an ammunition plant in the German city of Görlitz, where conditions were much better. That lasted until the camp was evacuated in the last days of the war, when he and his fellow prisoners were sent on a westward death march. His release by the SS at the time of Germany’s surrender was followed by a wild wagon ride across Czechoslovakia to Vienna.</p><p>Boder interviewed Minski at the Paris headquarters of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. He recalled his experiences in disorganized episodes.</p>

He was the nephew of Leonty Moiseivich Bramson, a president of ORT. Born in Russia in 1911, Jacques Bramson and his family moved to Poland after the 1917 Russian revolution and then emigrated to France in 1927. They were among a number of eastern European Jews who came to France during the inter-war period.</p><p>Mr. Bramson fought in the French army during World War II and was wounded and recovered. From the very beginning of the German occupation of France, he was one of a small number who became engaged in active resistance. He eventually moved to the town of Périgueux in the southwestern portion of the country. Determined to join the Free French armed struggle against the Germans he attempted to reach North Africa. He was unsuccessful and returned to Périgueux where he headed the ORT school. As time went on, he rose to become resistance commander of the entire district surrounding Périgueux. In the interview, he provides valuable information on the ORT school’s valuable contributions to the resistance, and on daily life in a resistance camp.</p><p>Mr. Bramson was captured by the Germans after being wounded in a gun battle in the summer of 1943. His wounds increased the pain he experienced while enduring terrible torture by German security forces. He came perilously close to being executed but was miraculously spared only to be severely tortured again.</p><p>Concealing his Jewish identity by posing as a Protestant, Mr. Bramson was ultimately sent to the infamous concentration camp Buchenwald as a French political prisoner. Had his true identity been known, his fate could have been far worse. In the latter portion of the interview, he recounts his horrific experiences in Buchenwald. He endured fifteen months of captivity in this camp, from early 1944 until his liberation by American troops in April 1945. Mr. Bramson provides information on certain aspects of the resistance activities in which he engaged while incarcerated in Buchenwald. (Some of his testimony regarding other aspects of the camp is open to question as is indicated in the footnotes.)</p><p>In the face of advancing American troops, the SS evacuated thousands of prisoners, Mr. Bramson among them, from Buchenwald and sent them on death marches. He survived in part because, along with several others, he overpowered the SS guards on the march and escaped. Upon his return to France, after a period of recuperation, he rejoined ORT. Mr. Bramson’s interview conveys a picture of a strong (both physically and morally), bright, cooperative, forthright and articulate individual. It is a remarkable story of courage, defiance, and luck as well as dramatic testimony to human resiliency and the capacity for regeneration.</p>",Elliot Lefkovitz

Boder, English Translation","<p>Jaques Matzner’s parents were among the 70,000 Polish Jews who had come to Germany before World War I in search of economic opportunities and refuge from Polish anti-Semitism. Germany, like most European countries at that time, naturalized foreigners only in exceptional cases. Hence Matzner bore his parents’ Polish citizenship even though he had been born in Wiesbaden in 1914.</p><p>In 1938 the Polish Jews in Germany were the first large group forcibly deported from the Third Reich, and Matzner was among them. But family ties could not be so easily broken, and he did not stay in Poland. Determined to save his parents and get his family to a safe haven, he undertook the risky business of smuggling himself back to Wiesbaden where he witnessed the Kristallnacht (literally, “Crystal Night,” also known as the “Night of Broken Glass”) pogrom of November 9-10, 1938. This was the Nazi response to the act of another son of Polish Jews expelled from Germany. Hershel Grynszpan, who had been sent to Paris by his parents, heard of their harsh treatment by German and Polish officials at the border, and murdered a German diplomat in Paris as an act of revenge.</p><p>Although Matzner’s family succeeded in escaping to Belgium, Hitler’s westward invasions overtook them in 1940. His aged mother died in Antwerp and hence was spared deportation and gassing, the usual fate of old people in the Holocaust. Matzner was trapped in France, and in 1941 he was included in the thousands of Jewish refugees handed over by the Vichy regime to the Germans. Then began a four-year trek through forced labor camps in Lower and Upper Silesia, beginning with several of the Organization Schmelt camps, continuing with the construction of satellite installations for the Gross-Rosen concentration camp empire, and ending in the Heinkel Aircraft factory near Wismar in northern Germany. Matzner reminds us once again of the important distinction between Jewish camp trusties and non-Jewish job foremen that marked life in several of the camps. Probably crucial to his survival was selection as a camp clerk, made possible by his business experience and his fluency in German. His father, a brother, and two sisters did not survive, however.</p><p>Matzner was liberated by the Russians in May 1945 and, following his recovery from intestinal typhus in a Russian hospital, returned to Wiesbaden. Far from rejecting the thought of a future for Jews in Germany, he appeared committed to staying. At the time he gave his interview on Rosh Hashana 1946 in the rehabilitated Wiesbaden synagogue, he was actively working to restore the local Jewish community with the support of the UNRRA. And yet, four years later he and his wife emigrated to the United States. Later he penned a memoir of the Holocaust that was published after his death in 1986.  From it we learn several things about its author that he did not share with Boder, including the fact that he studied in Jerusalem in the 1930s, was ordained a rabbi in 1938, and then returned to Wiesbaden to be with his parents. </p>",From FRESH WOUNDS: EARLY NARRATIVES OF HOLOCAUST SURVIVAL by Donald L.

He was the youngest member of his family to endure the trials and tribulations of the Occupation. In his interview, Jean recounts the daring escape he, his mother, and elder brother, Pierre, made across the Pyrenees mountains into neutral Spain in October 1943. They were among the some 30,000 Jews from France who made this difficult journey during the war years. They went without a guide and like most other Jewish escapees arranged their trip independently, without the aid of a rescue organization.</p><p>The Kahns were fortunate in their timing, because after the German occupation of southern France on November 11, 1942 (following the Allied landings in North Africa several days earlier), the Spanish expelled few refugees who managed successful border crossings. By the fall of 1943, when the Kahns crossed into Spain, it was obvious that the Germans were losing the war, and the Allies had put pressure on Spain earlier that year not to turn away refugees who had crossed the Spanish border—provided that they would leave the country for another destination without delay. One estimate is that between the summer of 1942 and the fall of 1944, some 7,500 Jews found temporary refuge in Spain.</p><p>This interview is part of a group of interviews with the eminent Kahn family and their chauffeur taken in Paris on August 21, 1946 during an evening at the home of Admiral Louis Kahn. The interviews were conducted in the following order: Abraham Schramack (Mrs. Kahn’s father), Jean Kahn (the family’s younger son) Anne Marcelle Kahn, and her husband, Admiral Kahn. These are followed by an interview with the family’s chauffeur, Charles Jean, who during the German occupation was in the French resistance. The Kahns were among the approximately 150,000 French Jews who had deep roots in France. (Another 200,000 Jews in France during the Holocaust were more recent immigrants.) Despite their long-standing residence in France, the Kahn family lived a precarious existence during the Occupation. Due to his service in the French navy, Admiral Kahn was separated from his family at the start of the war and was not in France during the war years.</p>",Elliot Lefkovitz

Evidently he was visiting Paris at the time of his interview and planned to return to Poland. For some unexplained reason he was prepared to grant only half an hour for his interview. When a spool ran out as his story neared its end, there was no follow-up. This is a pity, because Weinberg experienced the entire span of the Łódź ghetto and was one of only a few hundred Jews who escaped its liquidation in August 1944.</p><p>Short though it is, Julian Weinberg’s story offers some glimpses into the fate of Łódź Jewry, including its terrorization by ethnic Germans in the first months of Nazi rule and the frantic rush of Jews to escape the terror by moving into the ghetto created in April 1940. Evidently the Germans had succeeded in making it look attractive to at least some inhabitants of Łódź, because Weinberg had to prove that his son was who he said he was and not some Polish orphan seeking a “free ride” to the ghetto. The interview also reveals how the Nazis skillfully lied to the Jews to secure their cooperation at various points, including their final removal from the ghetto, ostensibly to workplaces in Germany, but actually to the gas at Chelmno and Auschwitz.</p><p>Julian recalls work in the ghetto as being “a kind of silent sabotage” of the Germans as well as of the Jewish Council, widely viewed as corrupt by the mass of Jews. His job in the furniture shop explains why he was one of some 800 Jews exempted from the final evacuation of the ghetto to clear it of valuables, including furniture in need of repair. As the Russian army approached he was among those with the wit to go to ground and evade German death squads that combed the ghetto.</p>

Jurek Kestenberg escaped from a German deportation train, recovered from a gunshot wound with the help of a compassionate Polish peasant, but made his way back to his parents in the Warsaw ghetto in 1943, well after it had become known that the Germans were exterminating Jews at Treblinka. Jurek’s age was difficult to determine; he said he was twelve when the Germans attacked Poland, thirteen in 1943 when he was sent to Majdanek, and seventeen at the time of his 1946 interview. His confusion was understandable after a long period during which he lied about his age to assure being assigned to work. He was the only child of a Warsaw Jewish industrialist and his wife. Their factory had been bombed by the Luftwaffe in 1939, but their savings sufficed to see them through ghettoization, build and maintain a hiding place in the ghetto, and spirit a five-year-old relative into hiding with Gentiles. Jurek told of his escape from the train and his return to the Warsaw ghetto as an afterthought to his memories of the ghetto uprising, which he spent in hiding with his family. In fact, the earlier events may be the most telling part of his story.</p><p>Following the suppression of the Warsaw ghetto uprising in May 1943, Kestenberg was sent to Majdanek together with his parents. There his mother was separated from her husband and son and probably perished. During the short time the two males remained at Majdanek, they worked on the Scheisskommando that carried human excrement from the cesspools to the camp gardens. Although it is sometimes argued that the SS left members of this work detail alone in order to avoid contact with the filth and smell, Jurek’s interview shows that the guards found ways of tormenting them as they struggled with the unwieldy vats. Then Jurek and his father were sent to work at the giant HASAG ammunition factories at Skarżysko-Kamienna. There Jurek watched his father sicken and die from overwork and undernourishment, the fate of thousands more like him.</p><p>As the Russians approached Skarżysko late in July 1944, the Germans evacuated his work group to Buchenwald. Jurek evaded the evacuation of Jews from Buchenwald in April 1945 with the help of a Czech block senior. Resettled in France with the help of Jewish charities, he was studying to be a dental technician in Paris and living in the ORT home at Chateau de Boucicaut at the time he gave his interview.</p>

Boder, Translation, Eben E. English, Footnotes","<p>Boder described Jürgen Bassfreund as “a young man of twenty-two who looks much younger than his age due to undernourishment and somewhat stunted physical development caused by the concentration camp regime.”<sup>1</sup> Born into a middle-class Jewish family in northwestern Germany, Jürgen recalled his physician father breaking up Nazi meetings before 1933 by threatening Jewish boycotts of local farmers. This oversimplified complicated local conditions and exaggerated the economic power of Germany’s Jews. It correctly pointed out, however, that they were not passive during Hitler’s rise to power.</p><p>Like most small-town Jews, Jürgen’s family reacted to Nazi persecution by moving to bigger towns and cities, seeking the shelter of large Jewish communities with their own schools and other social services. He and his mother were put to work at slave labor in a Berlin munitions factory during the war, and the importance of that labor to the German economy accounts for the fact that they were among the last Jews to be deported from the German capital to Poland in 1943. Since Jürgen had been removed from the ammunition factory to work on the rail lines, he and his mother were deported separately. He never learned exactly what happened to her. Jürgen’s confidence in the Berlin Jewish Community Council, which organized the deportations for the Nazis, remained unshaken at the time of his interview. Although the question of just how much Jewish leaders knew about genocide at the time remains open, recent research suggests that German Jewish institutions probably did as much as was possible under the circumstances to make life bearable for the Jews.</p><p>Jürgen tells us that he saved his life in Auschwitz by playing a trick on the Germans. And so he did, although it could easily have backfired. What is most interesting about this episode is that it succeeded with the help of his capo, a non-Jew and, in fact, one of the professional criminals who as a group were notable for barbaric mistreatment of fellow inmates. Unfortunately Jürgen does not elaborate much on the capo’s motives.</p><p>Like so many other survivors of Auschwitz, Jürgen recalls that the worst happened to him after he was evacuated from the giant concentration camp. He was sent to Dachau, near Munich, and then farmed out to work on a new airfield in southern Bavaria in the last months of the war. Jürgen was half dead with typhus when the Americans approached in April 1945, which may have saved him from the worse fate that befell some of his healthier fellow workers who were evacuated by the SS at the last minute.</p><p>Following his recovery in an American hospital, Jürgen moved to Fürth in northern Bavaria where he lived on his own in a German home, worked in a movie house, and learned English. When he gave his interview he was living in the “Funkenkasernen,” a former German signal corps center near Munich, then a huge DP camp. One of the few refugees fortunate enough to have all his papers in perfect order and a relative in America prepared to sponsor him, he was just days away from his departure for New York.</p><p class=”footnote”>1.

There the Jews were placed in an open ghetto between February 1941 and October 1942. Then those not needed for work were sent away, to Treblinka as it turned out, and the remaining 5,000 were pushed into barracks adjacent to the prewar ammunition factories, now renamed the Hermann Goring Works, to serve the needs of the German military.</p><p>Fourteen-year-old Eisenberg was one of the “lucky” ones, the only remaining member of his family not sent away with the others. He says little about what it was like in the Starachowice camp, but he has fairly vivid recollections of the prisoner revolt that occurred as the Germans prepared to liquidate the camp and move their slaves westward in July 1944. Fearful that they were about to be killed, the prisoners set fires and rushed the fences, only to be recaptured or shot down by the hundreds by the Ukrainian guards. Not one is known to have escaped and lived to tell about it.

Boder, English Translation","<p>Sometimes the best way to “pass” was to find refuge in some rural nook and hide behind a mask for the duration of the war. In 1942 Lena Kuechler found that living outside the ghetto in Warsaw with false papers left her open to blackmail and, finally, arrest. How she got to Warsaw is unclear. We know only that the young (born in 1912) woman from Wieliczka, near Kraków, studied at the Jagiellonian University at Kraków and taught school before the war. She and her husband evidently sought to melt into the urban masses of Warsaw during the early phases of the German occupation. They lived apart then, and relations between them must already have been strained. After the war they divorced.</p><p>Following an escape from German captors in 1942, Lena found a position as nanny on an aristocratic estate at Orchówek in eastern Poland, not far from Treblinka. Carefully playing the role of a non-Jew, she was able to record the attitudes of her employers; unlike some Polish aristocrats, these were no friends of the Jews. Following liberation by the Russians in 1944, she stayed on and founded a school on the estate, taking particular pleasure in revealing her Jewishness to her former mistress, who was now dependent upon her.</p><p>Once Warsaw fell, Lena sought in vain for her sister and then buried her grief in study for an advanced degree in educational psychology. Her life was eased in those months by the high position occupied by her brother in the new Polish government. When she agreed to help rehabilitate child survivors of the Holocaust who were then roaming about in Poland, she expected it to be a summer project. In fact it became the defining moment in her life. The hostility she encountered when she established a Jewish children’s home at a hill resort south of Kraków compelled her to lead her charges out toward Zion. This section of the interview is particularly interesting on the subject of Catholic attitudes
toward Jewish orphans who had been sheltered in church institutions during the Holocaust. For the priests and the sisters they were souls won for Jesus. For Kuechler they belonged to their people in Palestine. Attempts by church officials to extract payment from Jews for sheltering the orphans during the war must be viewed compassionately in light of the desperate poverty of these institutions at the end of the fighting.</p><p>By the time of her interview in Bellevue, a suburb of Paris, in September 1946, Kuechler had brought sixty youngsters between the ages of three and fifteen with her to France where they awaited certificates for emigration to Palestine. In Bellevue she directed a home for displaced Jewish orphans funded by French and American Jewish charities. Two years later Kuechler and her charges would sail for Israel.</p>

Mr. Richard shows himself to be a sincere and dedicated French patriot as he recounts his exploits as a lieutenant in the resistance movement during those dangerous times. He took part in a number of daring exploits at great personal risk—the risk of arrest, torture and death in a country where the Gestapo, Vichy French collaborators and the threat of denunciation by ordinary citizens put resisters in great peril. As he recounts, “I have never known any assignment that was not a dangerous one during the occupation . . . very often I came back alone when twenty of us had gone.”</p><p>Mr. Richard has great admiration for the proud, autocratic General Charles de Gaulle, leader of the Free French forces during the war. Like de Gaulle, Mr. Richard was above all a French nationalist. His nationalism is of the liberal variety, rejecting xenophobia, intolerance and racism. He does not reveal sympathy for any particular resistance political organization, whether it be communist, socialist or Catholic. Indeed, he appears to be apolitical and anti-clerical. Mr. Richard’s admiration for resistance leaders extends to those under whom he served, Colonel Goise, Major Borde, and Captain Allard, whose bravery and leadership qualities he is at pains to applaud.</p><p>Mr. Richard clearly shows sympathy for the plight of the Jews under German occupation, though there is no indication he was involved in Jewish rescue efforts. As might be expected, he scorns those who collaborated with the Germans but does not call for revenge or retribution. Rather he remains dedicated to the ideals of the French Revolution: liberty, equality and fraternity.</p><p>The interview illustrates the fact that, although they were a small minority, there was a core of active resisters in France who fought against the German occupiers for their own liberation.

Following the Nazi takeover, they were subject to humiliation and persecution, their delicatessen store was put out of business, and they lived in a daily climate of fear and anxiety. Like so many Jews in Austria at the time, they prepared to flee the country. However, the Johles family was still in Vienna during the Kristallnacht pogrom of November 9-10, 1938. The Nazis robbed them of all their valuables, but did not incarcerate Mr. Johles (as they did with many Jewish males) because he and his wife were Polish nationals.</p><p>In the wake of Kristallnacht, the Johles family fled to Brussels, where they remained until Germany invaded Belgium on May 10th, 1940. They then fled to southern France, where they fortunately survived the roundups of Jews in the summer and fall of 1942. In late December 1942, the Johles family, along with Mr. Johles’s sister and niece, found refuge in Switzerland after a harrowing time crossing the border. Although Mr. Johles was sent to a labor camp, the rest of the family remained free supported by Swiss and international Jewish organizations.<sup>1</sup></p><p>When Boder interviewed Malka Johles in Genève, Switzerland on August 28, 1946, she and her family were hoping to immigrate to the United States with the help of Mrs. Johles’s relatives. Boder promised to contact these relatives on his return and do what he could to help with the immigration process.</p><p>Malka Johles’s interview illustrates that flight was itself a form of resistance to the Nazis’ efforts to murder every single Jewish man, woman and child.

The interview was conducted in English. Mr. Mizrarchi was born and raised in Salonika, Greece, the most prominent Sephardic Jewish religious and cultural community in Europe at the time. It numbered some 56,000 Jews on the eve of World War II. Mr. Mizrachi was the only child of a fairly well-to-do family. His father was a sales representative for several companies importing various goods from abroad.</p><p>The Germans conquered Salonika on April 9, 1941, but it was not until March 1943 hat the deportations to Auschwitz Birkenau began. These were proceeded by humiliation, slave labor for some and systematic expropriation. On the eve of the deportations, there was widespread poverty, malnutrition and disease in the community. </p><p>Before the German conquest of Greece, however, Mr. Mizrachi and his family had fled to Athens, the capital of the country. Athens became part of the Italian zone of occupation. The Jews in Athens were treated by the Italians in a benevolent manner. Mr. Mizarchi’s family also relied for safety on Manis’ fathers Spanish citizenship. Spain, under fascist dictator Francisco Franco, remained neutral during World War II. The Germans occupied Athens after the fall of Benito Mussolini’s fascist Italian government in September 1943. In April 1944, those Jews in Athens who held Spanish citizenship were deported in a grueling and ghastly journey to Bergen Belsen concentration camp in Germany where they were interned in the so-called neutral camp for prisoners who were nationals of neutral countries. As English troops were closing in on Bergen Belsen in April 1945, Mr. Mizrachi and his family were deported to the Theresienstadt camp in Czechoslovakia but were liberated by American soldiers from the deportation train. Tragically, Mr. Mizrachi’s  father died of typhus on the family’s day of liberation, and his mother died shortly thereafter. Mr. Mizrachi also contracted typhus but survived. At  the time of the interview, he was studying radio in hopes of emigrating to the United States.</p><p>Mr. Mizrachi’s story reveals the suffering and loss experienced  even by those Jews who were fortunate to possess citizenship from neutral countries.

There is no indication in her interview that she had any siblings. She and her husband had one child, but her husband died in 1939, the year before France fell to the Germans. In the wake of the German occupation, Mrs. Precker’s parents and her young daughter fled south into the area controlled by the Vichy government.</p><p>Mrs. Precker remained in Paris to protect her father’s fur business and the family’s upscale apartment. She narrowly escaped arrest during the infamous roundup of Paris Jews on July 16 and 17, 1942. She then went to southern France to rejoin her family. They resided for a time in the city of Nice, which was in the Italian zone of occupation from June 1940 to September 8, 1943. During this time, the Italians treated Jews in their zone benevolently.</p><p>Following the collapse of Italy’s fascist government and the signing by the successor regime of an armistice with the Allies, the Germans occupied the Italian zone of southeastern France, and Mrs. Precker and her family moved to Cannes, where they were arrested in late June 1944. After spending about a month in prison, they were shipped to the notorious Drancy camp located in a suburb of Paris. They remained there for about three weeks until they were liberated shortly before Paris fell to the Allies on August 25, 1944.</p><p>Mrs. Precker’s account of her experiences illustrates the fanatic obsessiveness with which the Nazis pursed the “Final Solution to the Jewish Question” even when they were on the very edge of military defeat. Indeed, the imperative to murder every single Jew persisted up until the collapse of the Nazi regime. Mrs. Precker’s story also demonstrates the importance of luck, which played a crucial role in her escape from the July 1942 Paris roundup, and was an important factor in preventing the deportation of Mrs. Precker and her family from Drancy to Auschwitz and almost certain death. They were saved from this fate because they arrived in the camp shortly before Paris fell to the Allies. Finally, like so many survivors, though scarred and traumatized by their experiences, Mrs. Precker and her family were able to rebuild their lives after the war.</p>",Elliot Lefkovitz

He and a younger sister tried to flee their native city but were forced to return when the invaders overtook them. In the Łódź ghetto he learned metal-working skills that would save his life. Rather than being deported to a death camp, in 1943 he was sent to the ammunition plants at Częstochowa and Skarżysko-Kamienna. His description of conditions there shows that work was arduous and punishments draconian. At the same time it shows that tenuous contacts with Polish workers in the factories ameliorated the Jews’ position to some degree. Note the items confiscated from him and his fellow workers upon their arrival at Buchenwald. Herskovitz also shows that the Jews in Czestochowa retained some power to influence events by bribing German officials, as they did to save one of two transports of Jewish children evacuated from Skarżysko.</p><p>Not long after dumping Herskovitz in Buchenwald, the Nazis tried to move him yet again as the American Third Army approached the camp in April 1945. Indeed, the Germans gave Jews priority in these marches that often ended in the prisoners’ death. Mendel was immensely proud of eluding the guards and finding a place with the minority of prisoners who remained to be liberated. If he embellishes his tale of evasion and concealment a bit, we can forgive him; the outline of his experiences is perfectly credible, and, by any standard, remarkable. His description of the final, ecstatic contact with his liberators should touch the most jaded reader.</p><p>The interview took place at the home for young Jewish survivors at Chateau de Boucicaut just outside of Paris. There Herskovitz was studying to become a furrier. When kidded that there would be little call for that trade in Palestine, he expressed no interest in leaving France for kibbutz life. He had had enough, he said, of communal living.</p>

In the interview, Finkel briefly describes the mass killings of Jews that took place in November of 1941, in which at least seventeen thousand Jews were taken into the nearby forest and shot, which he attributes to native Ukrainians rather than German soldiers.</p><p>To escape the killings, Finkel traveled to western Poland, eventually ending up in the Sosnowiec Ghetto. From there, he was taken to the Gross-Rosen concentration camp. When Gross-Rosen was evacuated in March 1945 to avoid the advancing Soviet troops, Finkel was forced to endure a death march, in which prisoners who were unable to walk any further were shot and left by the side of the road.

Boder, Translation","<p>Boder interviewed a number of survivors from the major Polish cities of Lódz and Warsaw. In both, the Jews were placed in large, closed ghettos in 1940. Nechama Epstein-Kozlowski of Warsaw was perhaps the most cheerful and open of the survivors. Evidently the twenty-three-year-old woman had come to terms with the loss of all the other members of her large family. Recently married and visibly pregnant, she eagerly awaited her turn to emigrate to Palestine. </p><p>Her story, one of the most varied, comprises several types of ghettos, slave labor camps, and extermination centers. She begins as Warsaw fell to the Germans in 1939, recalling how Poles pointed her out as a Jew to Germans and threw her out of food lines. But Polish anti-Semitism was not unremitting. Following her jump from a train that she believed was carrying her and hundreds of other Jews to Treblinka, a Polish policeman working for the Germans directed her to a nearby ghetto rather than turn her over to the German patrols, which would have meant being shot on the spot.</p><p>Her escape from the death train was the first of many bold and risky acts to stay alive. Sick in the Auschwitz infirmary, she avoided being selected for the gas chamber by hiding among the Christian patients. Later, at Bergen-Belsen, she courted death by stealing turnips to keep from starving along with the other inmates. She also took chances for others, notably in the case of a stranger’s child who attached herself to Epstein-Kozlowski. Others helped her, particularly the Jewish prisoners of war at Majdanek who stole medicine to help her recover from malaria.</p><p>On the other hand, her story contains little indication of more active resistance to the Germans. The bodies sprawled in the streets as Epstein-Kozlowski entered the Miedzyrzec ghetto suggest that some of the Jews there may have tried to run away when the Germans came to deport them. By then fragmentary information about extermination centers had reached some of the ghettos. But if so, that was the end of defiance. During the period when flight might have been possible, Epstein-Kozlowski tells us that she simply “sat” in the ghetto, hiding from deportations but otherwise passively waiting for something to happen. Nor is there any indication of organized resistance to the ghetto’s Jewish Council or its Jewish police force during the eight months she was there.</p><p>Epstein-Kozlowski also has something to say about the perpetrators. The murderous Christmas eve raid by the SS on the Miedzyrzec ghetto more nearly resembles a perverted game than the dutiful act of reluctant murderers. Moreover, if she was spared from the crematorium at Auschwitz as part of an effort to provide witnesses to “humanitarian” behavior by the Germans, it suggests that already in 1943 at least some SS  doctors were preparing to save themselves from the full force of postwar justice.</p><p>After returning to Poland in 1945, Epstein-Kozlowski joined a kibbutz, married another survivor, and together with her new husband took the underground road through Czechoslovakia and Germany to a cooperative camp near Como, Italy, run by the Hachsharah with the aid of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee and UNRRA, which is where she spoke with Boder.</p>

Nelly Bondy spent two years at Auschwitz and then in Ravensbrück and its satellite camps, but what happened to her during that time was exceptional only in that her knowledge of German and English qualified her for a comparatively protected job in the Political Department of the Auschwitz administration offices. Of that job she has little to say beyond her matter-of-fact report that she learned from the files of the death of her husband, who had been sent there long before her arrival.</p><p>Bondy has more to say about her frantic efforts between 1940 and 1943 to keep her family together and protect her children from the Germans. Born in Vienna around 1915, she had met and married her husband, a Czech Jew living in Paris, in the mid-1930s. When Paris came under German fire in 1940, she bicycled to the south of France to reunite with her husband, then serving in a Czech unit under French command, and her two children. Her husband was arrested in 1941, shortly after the birth of their third child, and she smuggled all three of the children to safety in the unoccupied zone. She was arrested herself in March 1943 and after three months at Drancy was sent to Auschwitz.</p><p>Still more interesting is Bondy’s account of her escape from a Nazi death march at the end of the war. Evacuated from Auschwitz to Ravensbrück and then to a series of work camps south of Berlin, she simply walked away from her camp during an air raid and passed as a German refugee. Fluent in German, she had the wit to exploit the chaos of the collapsing Reich and secure the assistance of Nazi welfare agencies to stay alive in spite of her frostbitten feet. We will never know for certain if escaping saved her life, but it may have done so. SS men sometimes shot their charges at the last moment rather than let them go. In the last days of the war she found herself in a German-held area surrounded by Russian and American forces, encountering little sympathy from the latter when she approached them for help.</p><p>Boder interviewed Bondy in a storage room of one of the Paris offices of the Joint Distribution Committee.</p>

His family was originally from Portugal. From 1916 to 1936, Mr. Barzilai lived in Spain where he was in the jewelry business. He then returned to Salonika where he worked  selling fabrics for women’s clothing. At the time of the interview, Mr. Barzilai was married with a fifteen year old son. The interview was conducted in Spanish in a home for adult Jews in Paris.</p><p>Following the outbreak of war between Greece and Italy as a result of Italian aggression, Mr. Barzilai and his family fled to Athens. After the German conquest of Greece in April 1941, Athens was in the Italian zone of occupation. Mr. Barzilai was able to obtain Portuguese citizenship (Portugal was a neutral country during World War II) for himself and his family  and continue in the women’s clothing business. The Barzilai family and other Jews in Athens lived under relatively mild Italian rule until Italy capitulated to the Allies in September 1943 and the Germans took over the city.</p><p>Despite having obtained Portuguese citizenship, Mr. Barzilai, along with a number of other Athenian Jewish males, had to endure five and one half months of slave labor under German occupation. Then, in early 1944, he and his family were deported to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany. They were interned in the so-called “neutral camp”. As the British army approached the camp in March, 1945, the Barzilai’s were evacuated along with others but were liberated by the American army from the deportation train.</p><p>At the time of the interview in a Parisian residence for Jewish refugees, Mr. Barzilai and his family had decided to remain in France. He had found work as an electrician, and his son was being trained in carpentry. He was very grateful for help given to him and his family  that enabled them to begin to rebuild their lives.</p><p>Mr. Barzilai and his family were among the fortunate handful of Greek Jewish survivors. Their survival was based in large measure on the fact that they had obtained Portuguese citizenship and along with others with citizenship from neutral countries were interned in Bergen-Belsen under much better conditions than prisoners elsewhere in the camp. They enjoyed better nourishment and sanitary conditions and were subject to less cruelty. Yet, as testified to by the detailed lists of Greek Jews murdered in the Shoah which Mr. Barzilai gave to Boder, he had not forgotten about the bitter fate of the great majority of his Greek co-religionists.</p>",Elliot Lefkovitz

Boder, Transcription, Elliot Lefkovitz, Footnotes","<p>Otto Feuer was one of the relatively small numbers of Jews who spent twelve years—the entire span of the “Thousand Year Reich”—under Nazi rule and survived. Feuer was born in Vienna, shortly after the start of World War I. His family then moved to Hamburg where he was studying law when the Nazis came to power on January 30, 1933. When the Nazis imposed restrictions on Jews in higher education, he was forced to give up his studies. He supported himself by giving chess lessons, but in October 1938 Feuer and his family, along with other Jews of Polish origin (Feuer’s father had been born in Poland), were expelled from Germany to Poland. This expulsion was the prelude to the infamous Kristallnacht (literally “Crystal night,” also known as the “Night of Broken Glass”) pogrom of November 9th and 10th, 1938: Herschel Grynszpan (the son of one of these displaced Jewish families, who was at the time living in Paris) sought a means to arouse public opinion in the West regarding Nazi crimes against the Jews. He entered the German embassy in Paris on November 9th and murdered Ernst vom Rath, an embassy official. The Nazis used this murder as a pretext to launch the Kristallnacht pogrom.</p><p>In the summer of 1939, Feuer and members of his family received permission to reenter Germany in order to emigrate to the United States. Although his two brothers were able to do so, Feuer was not as fortunate. On September 9th, 1939, just after the outbreak of World War II, he was arrested and spent the next six years in captivity, first in prison and then in Sachsenhausen concentration camp, followed by incarceration in Dachau and finally in Buchenwald from June 1941 until its liberation on April 11, 1945.</p><p>Buchenwald’s original inmates were German criminals who wore a green triangle. Political prisoners who wore a red triangle soon followed. In the bitter competition between the “greens” and the “reds” for control of the prisoner administration of the camp, the “reds” emerged victorious. They then had to wage an unrelenting struggle against their vicious and often corrupt SS overlords. Feuer endured nightmarish, horrific experiences in the camps, some of which he relates. He testifies as well to the moral compromises prisoners had to make to stay alive, the obstacles to resistance in the camps, the depravity of Buchenwald SS physicians, and the exploitation of women in the camp’s brothel.</p><p>One of the most sordid, although until recently unexplored, chapters in the history of the camps was the use of female concentration camp inmates to provide sexual services to non-Jewish male forced laborers who could buy a quarter of an hour with a prostitute from the pittance they were given for their work. Some 300-400 women, most from the Ravensbrück concentration camp, were forced into prostitution in ten camps, including Buchenwald. Most were German women imprisoned for “antisocial” behavior. Feuer’s interview provides pertinent details on the operation of the Buchenwald brothel. The program was devised by Heinrich Himmler as a way to incentivize production for forced laborers and prevent homosexual relations among them. Separate brothels were established in the camps for SS guards. The women who endured sexual slavery in the camps emerged deeply scarred and traumatized by their experiences.</p><p>Despite the obstacles to resistance in Buchenwald, the prisoner underground could claim several successes, some of which are described by Feuer, such as the establishment of a lice control program to ward off the spread of typhus, and saving the lives of some sick prisoners. Just prior to the liberation of Buchenwald on April 11, 1945, the armed underground actually gained control of the camp. When American forces entered the facility, they found some 21,000 prisoners, among them Feuer, and several hundred children who had been saved by the prisoner resistance. Elie Wiesel and Moshe Lau, the future chief Ashkenazic rabbi of Israel, were among the children.</p><p>Feuer’s comments regarding prisoner behavior following the liberation are of significant interest, as are those about the assistance provided to the former inmates by American troops and his encounters with German civilians. Feuer could not bear to remain in Germany after all that he been through. He decided to travel to Paris, where he had some distant relations and wait there until he could entry to the United States, where his two brothers were residing. Since he had been born in Vienna and years earlier had registered for a visa, he was attempting to gain entry to this country under the Austrian quota.</p><p>Feuer is an obviously intelligent and capable individual. Following the liberation of Buchenwald, he was involved in the administration of the camp by its former inmates and served as a guide for Americans who came to visit the camp. He then found work for a time as a journalist and was interviewed by Boder in the Paris office of the American Joint Distribution Committee where he was an executive employee. He emerged from six years of anti-Semitic persecution and horrific experiences in the camps scarred but with his moral sensibilities intact and able to find productive employment and function well in human society. All this, as well as his desire to rebuild his life in America, testify to his life affirmation and the strength and resilience of the human spirit.</p>",Elliot Lefkovitz

Naturally that was always easier for persons of means, and Pinkhus Rosenfeld’s family, owners of a successful textile factory in Łódź, had already purchased a residence in Palestine preparatory to emigration. Hitler intervened.</p><p>With more resources than the average Jewish resident of Łódź, some of Rosenfeld’s family attempted to escape the worst of the occupation by moving to Warsaw, only to find conditions there become as bad as those at home. In the end this divided the family between the two cities. Pinkhus’s parents, brothers, and two daughters, separated from him in Warsaw, disappeared into the machinery of destruction. Pinkhus, his wife, and two sons remained in Łódź until its ghetto was liquidated in August 1944. Although in the interview he took pains to distance himself from the Rumkowski administration, there can be little doubt that it required pull to get and keep the coveted job of food distributor, one of the few ways of getting enough nourishment to stay alive.</p><p>In 1944 Rosenfeld was separated from his wife and two young cousins at Auschwitz and never saw them again. He and his teenage sons, however, managed to stay together, and they were healthy enough to be selected for work in Germany. There they were comparatively well treated. Marched into the Sudetenland as the Reich collapsed, they were simply abandoned by their SS guards and, after the fighting ended, recuperated in Prague. Although they contemplated smuggling themselves into Palestine in 1945, health considerations persuaded them otherwise. When interviewed at the ORT school near Paris in September 1946, the forty-three-year-old Rosenfeld was understandably impatient that he and his sons had not yet been granted entry to Palestine, indignant that his ownership of property there had not opened all doors.</p>

Boder, Translation, Elliot Lefkovitz, Footnotes","<p>Polia Bisenhaus was born in the southeastern Polish town of Staszów in the Kielce district. Staszów had a prewar Jewish population of approximately 5,000, fully half of the total population. On September 7-8, 1939, one week after the outbreak of World War II, the Germans arrived in Staszów. They appointed a Jewish council and subjected the Jewish population to heavy fines, humiliations, beatings, forced labor, and killings. On June 15, 1942, the Germans sealed the Staszów ghetto, and in June and October 1942 a number of Jews were executed. On November 8, 1942, 6,000 Jews from the ghetto, including a number of Jews who had come to Staszów since the war’s outbreak, were deported to the Belzec and Treblinka extermination centers. The last few hundred Jews from the Staszów ghetto were deported to Treblinka on January 10, 1943.</p><p>Bisenhaus escaped all this because she was working as a forced laborer in a Hassag (privately owned German industrial company that employed slave labor) munitions factory in the city of Kielce. (Kielce would become infamous immediately after the war when elements of the town’s Polish population conducted a pogrom against Jewish Holocaust survivors on July 4, 1946. Forty-two Jews were killed, and fifty more were wounded. This pogrom help spark a mass exodus of survivors from Poland and elsewhere.) While most of her family, including her parents and her two brothers and three sisters did not survive the war, Polia’s forced labor in the militarily vital munitions factory helped insure her survival during the three years she worked there. She continued working in the factory until the winter of 1945 when, as the Red army advanced, she was evacuated to another munitions factory in Częstochowa located southeast of Kielce. As the German retreat continued, Polia was then evacuated to the notorious Bergen-Belsen camp in northern Germany near the town of Celle.</p><p>Bergen-Belsen began in July 1943 as a camp for prisoners whom the Nazis wished to exchange for Germans in allied territory. At first, conditions were better there than those in other camps, but especially towards the end of 1944, there was a marked deterioration. Thousands of inmates were sent to the camp as the Germans retreated in the wake of the Red army’s winter offensive. Most arrived starved and disease-ridden. Conditions in the camp were horrendous and were exacerbated by the winter cold, especially in January and February 1945. Polia tells of the incredibly meager food rations she received, the totally inadequate sanitary facilities, the murderous appells, and the beatings and utter degradation she underwent. All around her inmates were perishing from extreme malnutrition from tuberculosis and dysentery and from a typhus epidemic which raged in the camp. (It was this epidemic that claimed the life of Anne Frank in Belsen in March 1945).</p><p>By the spring of 1945, nearly 20,000 inmates had died. When the British army liberated the camp on April 15, they were shocked and horrified both by the living skeletons they found and by the 10,000 unburied bodies strewn about the camp, which had to be buried in mass graves. The 58,000 mostly Jewish inmates who were still alive were in critical condition. During the two months following liberation, an additional 13,944 perished. Bergen-Belsen became synonymous with man’s inhumanity towards his fellow human beings.</p><p>Several weeks prior to Belsen’s liberation, Polia had been transported on a harrowing train journey south to Bavaria where she was incarcerated in several subcamps of Dachau. She was liberated by the American army on April 29, 1945 in the main camp of Dachau. Like other inmates brought to Dachau at the time, she was a walking skeleton, exhausted and malnourished almost to the point of death.</p><p>Boder recorded this interview on July 29th, 1946 in the ORT school in Paris. Polia was brought to Paris after the war by her aunt and uncle who had been residing there for a number of years. Boder noted that this was only the second interview he had conducted for his project, which contributes to some confusion at the start. He also noted that Polia understandably still seemed to be affected by the sufferings she had endured. She indeed bears testimony to the deep and lasting losses and emotional and psychological scars borne by the victims of the Holocaust. Boder was kind enough to offer to make contact with an uncle whom Polia said she had in Chicago. However, she did not wish to emigrate to the United States but rather, like so many survivors at the time, to make a new life for herself in Palestine.</p>",Elliot Lefkovitz

Boder, English Translation","<p>David Boder was well-acquainted with Professor Dimitri Odinets since he was one of Boder’s instructors at the Psychoneurological Institute in pre-World War I St. Petersburg. Following the February 1917 revolution which toppled the government of the Tsar Nicholas II, Odinets was appointed Minister on All Russian Affairs by the new Provisional government. He was sent to Kiev, the capital city of Ukraine, to combat right-wing Ukrainian nationalist separatism. One can infer from his interview that Professor Odinets was part of the liberal nationalist Russian intelligentsia.</p><p>The communist Bolsheviks—headed by Vladimir Lenin—toppled the Provisional government in October 1917. Soon thereafter, a horribly bitter civil broke out between the communists and their opponents, which lasted until the communist victory in 1921. During this time, Odinets was in the turbulent Ukraine as communist and anti-communist forces clashed in a bloody struggle. </p><p>Odinets made a perilous escape to Romania in 1921 and eventually settled in Paris, where he helped found the Russian People’s University and the Franco-Russian Institute. For a time, he was chairman of the Russian Pedagogical Society in France. When interviewed by Boder, Professor Odinets was working as general secretary of the Russian Academic Union of France and editor of the paper <em>The Soviet Patriot</em>, as well as chairman of the board of the Turgenov library. At the time of the interview on October 4, 1946, Professor Odinets still had hopes of returning to the Soviet Union. This aspiration indicated that his Russian patriotism—which had undoubtedly been strengthened by the Soviet victory in World War II, the “Great Patriotic War,” and longing for his homeland—had overridden his antipathy to communism.</p><p>The bulk of Boder’s interview focuses on Professor Odinets’s experiences in Paris under German occupation. Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union, he was interned by the Nazis due to his Russian origins and failure to cooperate with them. After spending ten months in an interment camp at Compiègne-Royallieu, he was released. He clearly pointed out the differences between German treatment of Jews and non-Jews in the camp, with the former suffering to a greater extent. Upon his release, Professor Odinets supported himself by giving Russian lessons and became engaged in underground work, helping to publish the paper which became <em>The Soviet Patriot</em>.</p><p>Professor Odinets states that while there were some in the Russian colony in Paris who did collaborate with the Germans, most did not, he among them. His testimony in the interview shows him to be courageous and principled individual.</p>",Elliot Lefkovitz

Boder, English Translation","<p>Jews could sometimes run away from the Germans and live in the forests of eastern Europe, but their chances of survival were slim. Rabbi Solomon Horowitz, the spiritual leader of 1,400 Jews in the Polish town of Potok, led a portion of his flock into the woods. Less than a year later nearly all of them were dead.</p><p>Potok is in Galicia, the easternmost reaches of prewar Poland that fell to the Germans only in June 1941.The thirty-two-year-old Rabbi Horowitz at first attempted to placate the Nazis when they looted his people and removed them to the ghetto in nearby Buczacz. Later he encouraged them to hide from deportations that occurred in October and November 1942 and from the massacres at Fedor Hill in February and March 1943. His story shows once again that the Germans unhesitatingly resorted to mass shooting once the Jews learned about the death camps and began to resist deportations. It also suggests that by then the Germans were treating the existence of death camps as an open secret, in Buczacz at least. On the other hand, the rabbi’s assertion that he personally witnessed the Fedor Hill massacres should, perhaps, not be taken literally. This was a man who was both determined to convince a foreign observer of Nazi atrocities and unused to having his words questioned. That the mass shootings did occur, of course, is not disputed.</p><p>Discovered in their hiding place in Buczacz while trying to aid a family of homeless Jews, Rabbi Horowitz and his elder son slipped away from a large group of prisoners and made it to the forest with several hundred Jews. There they established a “family camp” of men, women, and children of all ages organized for survival rather than partisan action against the Germans. But how could they survive without reliable sources of food and shelter, in constant danger of being discovered by unfriendly peasants, and with only minimal aid from Soviet partisans operating far from their front lines? The rabbi provides a profoundly depressing sketch of the destruction of the camp during the last months of 1943. He and a handful of fellow fugitives lived to experience liberation by the Red Army in March 1944 by bribing a peasant to hide them under his barn. In Warsaw following its liberation, Rabbi Horowitz personally experienced the anti-Semitic climate that made a revival of Jewish Orthodoxy in the Polish capital all but impossible.</p><p class=”footnote”>Boder interviewed the rabbi at the once grand but then run-down chateau at Hénonville near Paris, home of an orthodox kibbutz run jointly by the ORT and the Agudah. Note near the end the rabbi’s expression of Orthodox Jewry’s changed view of Zionism in the wake of the Holocaust.</p>

She avoided stipulating her politics in the interview, but internal evidence suggests that she was at least close to the Polish Communist party, in which Jews were disproportionately represented. This gave her intimate contacts among non-Jewish Poles in Warsaw, friends who saved her life by spiriting her out of the ghetto on the eve of the 1943 revolt, after which she “passed” as a non-Jew. Previous to that she had avoided deportation by making herself useful to the Warsaw ghetto administration and, indirectly, the Germans. Since 1921 she had been secretary of the Polish ORT, the vocational training organization founded in Russia in 1880. Since the Germans needed skilled Jewish workers, the ORT was one of the few prewar Jewish institutions preserved under German rule. And yet, her position was no absolute shield from deportation as her description of a close call makes plain. Trapped by chance in a public square during a raid, she exploited confusion and a ruse thrown out by a friend to melt into the crowd of onlookers.</p><p>Beyond providing valuable information about the ORT’s work in the ghetto, Gurmanova intelligently comments on several other aspects of ghetto life: the work she was forced to do for the German Trusteeship Office, which collected and organized the movable property of Jews who had been deported or killed; Nazi manipulation of the Jews’ psychological vulnerability; and the courthouse forming part of the ghetto wall in which Jews and non-Jews might still make precarious contacts. She also makes it clear that without official corruption and the money to exploit it, her story would have ended quite differently.</p><p>Rachel Gurmanova exposed her personal grief reluctantly and only after gentle prodding. Apparently she lost most of her family, including her mother and her son; she never mentioned her husband. Unable to begin again in Warsaw after the war, she moved to Łódź and threw herself into rebuilding the ORT. Technically she was not a displaced person. She was visiting Paris as a delegate to a world ORT convention when interviewed in August 1946, and she was clearly determined to return to Poland and reestablish Jewish life there.</p>",From FRESH WOUNDS: EARLY NARRATIVES OF HOLOCAUST SURVIVAL by Donald L.

Boder disagreed with the judgment of supervisory personnel at the home that she was somewhat mentally retarded, believing rather that she was deeply disturbed.

Her parents, natives of southeastern Poland, an area of mixed Polish and Ukrainian population, hid their family from the Germans in a bunker, and then in the forests, alternately helped and looted by the local Ukrainians. Her father allowed himself to be persuaded by Jews from his own community that it was safest to return to the ghetto, whereas her mother insisted on chancing fugitive survival for herself and her two children.

Ms. Benmajor was born in Salonika Greece, home to the largest Sephardic Jewish community in Europe. She was seventeen years old when, in 1943m she her parents, two brothers and her elder brother’s wife and four children were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Except for Ms. Benmajor and her elder brother, all the rest were murdered.</p><p>Ms. Benmajor worked as a slave laborer in Auschwitz, first doing especially difficult road construction work and then for about a year in a shoe repair detail. In the fall of 1944, Ms. Benmajor was force marched to Ravensbruck, originally established as the only all-female camp in the Third Reich. There she once again had to engage in grueling road construction work. As the front neared, she was again deported, this time to first one and then to a second Ravensbruck sub camp.</p><p>She was finally liberated by the Russians  in the closing days of the war. After a short period of recuperation, she and some two dozen other liberated prisoners walked across Germany  for three weeks until they reached the American zone of occupation. As a result of her acquaintance with two French women, Ms. Benmajor came to Paris where she received help from refugee relief organizations.

A Polish Jew married to a Jewish physician in Kielce, she accompanied him as a nurse’s aid when he was called up by the Polish army at the time of the German invasion. They ended up at L’viv in the Soviet zone of occupation and encountered the Germans for the first time when L’viv fell in June 1941. There they lived through the devastating pogroms carried out by local anti-Semites, both Polish and Ukrainian, who believed a Nazi story that bodies found at the city’s NKVD (the Soviet secret police) jail were the victims of “Jewish Bolsheviks.” Evidently both she and her husband managed to escape from a forced labor camp at L’viv, but Roma’s husband fades from her story until their final separation in 1943, when she was sent to Majdanek. Quite possibly the painful memory of his loss explains her self-centered narrative; later she affirms that until 1943 they were always together.</p><p>Polish friends warned Tcharnabroda that the Germans were sending the Jews to crematoria, prompting her to seek the anonymity of Warsaw, passing as an “Aryan” with forged papers. Like so many Jews in her situation, she was betrayed by hostile Poles and sent into the ghetto, where she worked gathering Jewish belongings for delivery to the Germans. At this point in her story Boder asked her to skip ahead to her time in the camps. He was pressed for time and had heard about the Warsaw ghetto from other survivors.</p><p>Tcharnabroda was deported to Majdanek from Warsaw shortly before the ghetto rose in revolt. She has some instructive things to say about women’s physiological responses to overwork and undernourishment and about the disposal of bodies at Majdanek. Without a doubt her most moving anecdote is of the Majdanek women’s standing tribute to a comrade hanged by the Germans, an act of courage and defiance in the face of SS guards. At some point late in 1943 Roma was sent to work in munitions factories in western Poland and then, as the Russians drew near, to the infamous women’s concentration camp Ravensbrück, north of Berlin. Her feet became frozen just prior to the final evacuation to Bavaria at the end of the Third Reich, and her American liberators had to amputate both legs below the knee.</p><p>The German Museum in Munich, where Tcharnabroda gave her interview, was then the site of a UNRRA college where she was studying pharmacy and waiting for permission to enter the United States.

Sigmund Reich did just that, although only at the end of a long ordeal.</p><p>Reich was born in 1926 in Austria and spent his childhood in Belgium, but he was taken to Poland in 1934. His choice of Yiddish for the interview suggests that his parents were natives of Poland. The family lived in Kraków when the Germans made that city the capital of their “General Government” in 1939. Reich’s father fled to the Soviet-occupied zone of Poland, while the rest of the family stayed behind. They were among the thousands of Kraków Jews who succumbed to German pressure to relocate “voluntarily” in 1940, moving in with an aunt who lived in a nearby town. A year or two later (Reich is vague about dates) he reported for forced labor in the vain hope that the Germans would then leave his mother and aunt in peace. Sent to Mielec, one of dozens of forced labor camps in southeastern Poland that were later taken over by Auschwitz and officially redesignated “concentration camps,” Reich evidently became proficient in the manufacture of aircraft parts for the Germans, which greatly enhanced his chances of living.</p><p>Reich’s memories of endless drudgery as a slave worker in Poland are almost completely overshadowed by the truly wretched conditions he encountered at a work camp in Germany during the last months of the war. At the end, when he was among those evacuated from Dachau, his chance came. Left momentarily unattended by a guard, Reich and a small group of compatriots simply walked away and made for the Swiss border. With courage born of desperation, they claimed that they had become separated from a Red Cross transport bound for Switzerland and brazenly demanded help from German officials to complete the journey. There actually were such Red Cross transports at the time, and police and railroad officials may have known about them, but in any case everyone wanted these inconvenient wayfarers out of their
hair. Reich is unclear about how he and his comrades cleared the border, but it seems likely that Swiss officials used their influence with German colleagues who, after, all, could not have been too eager to go down as war criminals during the last days of the Third Reich.</p><p>Once in Switzerland the Swiss Red Cross gave Reich every assistance. After passing through several camps, he began to study mechanics as well as other subjects designed to prepare him for life in Palestine at an ORT school in Geneva, where he gave his interview.</p>

Boder, English Translation","<p>The Upper Silesian city of Bedzin where Udel Stopnitsky was born in 1915 is just a few miles from the hometown of Abraham Kimmelmann, another Boder interviewee. In the 1930s it had nearly 60,000 inhabitants, about half of them Jews. Stopnitsky mentions initial German atrocities there in September 1939 but provides details only for the period after 1941, when Nazi policies caused the Jewish population of Bedzin to double. Not only did the Germans ship Jews from small communities in the surrounding area to the city; they also put off construction of a ghetto there until January 1943, which made it for some time a refuge for Jews fleeing harsher persecution elsewhere in Poland. Stopnitsky points out that in 1942 the Jews in Bedzin heard about Auschwitz from an escapee and apparently believed what they were told. And yet, apart from constructing hiding places to avoid deportations to the nearby killing center, Stopnitsky recalls more resignation and denial than resistance among his fellow Jews. He holds Moshe Merin responsible for lulling the Jews into a false sense of hope that deportation meant being sent to work someplace else.</p><p>Stopnitsky remained in Bedzin until the Germans began to liquidate the local ghetto on August 1, 1943. Perhaps the most affecting passages of his interview describe attempts by his family and others to evade the deportations by hiding in cleverly concealed rooms in their ghetto apartments. Especially for those like Stopnitsky who had children, the results were usually tragic. After a few days, hiding became impossible. Stopnitsky and his family, together with many of their neighbors, simply gave themselves up. Sent to Auschwitz with five members of his family, only he survived. One of his most vivid memories of Auschwitz was the cruelty of the Jewish capos there. He was then sent to work at the Krupp arms plant at Fünfteichen, the same camp that held Kimmelmann (although there is no indication that they knew each other there). When it was evacuated in the early part of 1945, Stopnitsky was sent via Gross-Rosen to Flossenbürg concentration camp in Germany, and he ended up being marched from there to Theresienstadt in Czechoslovakia, where he remembers conditions being still comparatively good. Among his memories of the last days of this “model” ghetto was the arming of Jews by Czech guards, who until then had worked for the Germans.</p><p>As Stopnitsky saw it, postwar Europe could only be viewed as a land of exile, one that “burned,” in the colorful Yiddish term that traditionally referred to anti-Jewish violence. Two of his brothers gained entry into Palestine by impersonating members of the “Jewish Brigade” of Palestinian Jews who had volunteered to fight Hitler in Europe. Stopnitsky, however, returned to Bedzin to discover the fate of his remaining family. There he experienced the persistence of Polish anti-Semitism at first hand. At the time of his interview in September 1946 at Hénonville, France, Stopnitsky had just arrived to take charge of an ultraorthodox kibbutz financed by American Jewish charities. There 120 Jews like himself learned carpentry, tailoring, and agricultural skills in preparation for new lives in Palestine.</p>

BoderYan MannAnna Holian, English Translation, Anna Holian, Footnotes","<p>David Boder’s interview with Valerius Michelson was part of a series he conducted at the UNRRA University in Munich in September 1946. The first half of the interview focuses on Estonia during the Soviet and Nazi occupations, the second half on Michelson’s end-of-war and post-war experiences in Austria and Germany. The most detailed testimony concerns the material and psychological state of “displaced persons” in post-war Germany and Michelson’s work in helping to establish the UNRRA University. Importantly, much of what Michelson tells Boder about his pre-war and war time experiences is half-true at best. This explains why his testimony is often halting in style, and broad and imprecise in substance.</p><p>Michelson was born in St. Petersburg in 1916. He spent his early years in Estonia, where he was part of the substantial Russian émigré community that developed there after the Bolshevik Revolution. In 1926, Michelson returned to the Soviet Union with his father. However, in the interview, he suggests that he remained in Estonia until the early 1940s. In fact, he studied architecture at the Russian Academy of Fine Arts in Leningrad from 1935 to 1941. Drafted into the Red Army after the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, he was eventually captured by the Germans. Due to his good knowledge of German, he avoided being sent to a Soviet POW camp. Instead, he worked as an interpreter and as a contractor, helping to build field hospitals on the Eastern front. By his own admission, he served in the German army. As the Red Army began its long westward advance, Michelson retreated with the Germans, eventually ending up in Vienna. Then, as the Soviets advanced on Vienna, he moved west again, eventually crossing into Germany and finding his way to Munich.<sup>1</sup></p><p>Although many specific incidents that Michelson relates may be true (e.g., the arrest of his father, his train trip to Vienna), they must be understood as part of a different story that Michelson deliberately obscures from Boder. The biography that Michelson provides Boder can in turn be seen as part of a “cover” Michelson developed to protect himself from forcible repatriation to the Soviet Union and punishment as a deserter and traitor. He offered similar biographical details on the U.S. Military Government Questionnaire (“Fragebogen”) he filled out in January 1946 in order to gain admittance to the UNRRA University.<sup>2</sup> His interview with Boder is thus most useful for its detailed discussion of the life of displaced persons in postwar Germany and as a fascinating example of the diversionary tactics DPs developed to avoid unwelcome inquiries into their war time biographies.</p><p class=”footnote”>1.

Boder, Translation, Eben E. English, Footnotes","<p>Viktor Ferdinansk was not a Jewish Holocaust survivor, but a Roman Catholic Lithuanian who spent the war in Germany. He provides an interesting perspective from the point of view of a non-Jew who spent the war in a German Franciscan monastery from 1941 to 1945. In the autumn of 1940 Ferdinansk enrolled in a Roman Catholic Seminary in Kovno. But because of the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in that year and the hostility of the communists to all religious institutions, he was sent by the Franciscan Order to Germany with instructions to first journey to Italy. He was accused of entering Germany illegally, was arrested and interrogated by the Gestapo and spent about four months in a work camp. After his release he decided to live in Catholic Bavaria where he worked in Munich in a Franciscan monastery. He had to report to the police every week, was not allowed to speak Lithuanian and was denied the right of correspondence. At the end of the war Ferdinansk abandoned his commitment to theology and decided to study law so that he would not have to work among the German clergy.</p><p>Throughout the interview Ferdinansk emphasized that the Germans in the seminary looked down upon him as a foreigner. Boder asked him what the Franciscan brothers thought of the Nazis and the war. He said that the older generation of clergy were opposed to Nazism, while the younger generation tended to support the Nazis because of indoctrination and military service. When asked what he and the German Franciscans in the Seminary knew about the persecution and murder of the Jews he replied, “Yes. Well what was done with the Jews had become clear to everybody. We all knew that the Jews were incarcerated and murdered. That all the Germans knew as well.” He remarked that while the clergy in his Seminary and at least one of his professors disapproved of the mistreatment of the Jews, they also felt that there was nothing that they could do. And when asked whether they wanted Germany to win the war, he replied that although attitudes varied, most wanted Germany to win because of nationalism and the hope of the survival of Germany.</p><p>Ferdinansk remarked that he did not notice any war guilt on the part of the clergy or the Germans in general, reiterating the deep sorrow he felt because of the contempt he endured because he was a foreigner, even though he was a fellow Catholic. He himself felt that “every man is in some way guilty of the deeds of his fellow man.”<sup>1</sup> Ferdinansk decided to study law at the UNRRA University instead of one of the German universities. In his conclusion, Viktor Ferdinansk revealed that he feared to attempt searching for his parents, for by 1945 Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union and the authorities would likely be hostile to a Lithuanian who had been a member of a Franciscan monastery in Germany.</p><p>As a Lithuanian, Ferdinansk was allowed to live in Germany for the duration of the war, unlike German Jews who were expelled and murdered. Lithuania had become an independent nation after the First World War, was incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940, from 1941 to 1945 was controlled by Nazi Germany, and was reincorporated into the Soviet Union in 1945. Lithuanian fascist groups assisted the Nazis in the murder of the Lithuanian Jews, although Ferdinansk would not have had first-hand knowledge of this. Despite his experience that some German Catholics disapproved of the treatment of the Jews, most were indifferent and some were fervent supporters of Hitler.<sup>2</sup>  

</p>
<p>Viktor Ferdinansk’s testimony provides a glimpse of what it was like for a Lithuanian who was initially favorably disposed toward Germany to become disillusioned with German racial policies and anti-Christian attitudes of the Nazis. It also illustrates the difference between the Nazi disdain for non-Germans—in this case Lithuanians—and outright murder conducted against the Jews, the Gypsies, and the disabled. Finally, it suggests that the murder of the Jews was widely known in Nazi Germany, according to this testimony taken in 1946.</p><p class=”footnote”>1.
